You&#39;re not out of it until the computer says you&#39;re out of it.</p><p>Medicine is my lawful wife and literature my mistress when I get tired of one, I spend the night with the other.</p><p>When I was born I was so ugly the doctor slapped my mother.</p><p>Doctors are just the same as lawyers the only difference is that lawyers merely rob you, whereas doctors rob you and kill you too.</p><p>The doctor sees all the weakness of mankind the lawyer all the wickedness, the theologian all the stupidity.</p><p>Doctors will have more lives to answer for in the next world than even we generals.</p><p>All sorts of computer errors are now turning up. You&#39;d be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men.</p><p>Illness is the doctor to whom we pay most heed to kindness, to knowledge, we make promise only pain we obey.</p><p>Three-quarters of the sicknesses of intelligent people come from their intelligence. They need at least a doctor who can understand this sickness.</p><p>A physician&#39;s physiology has much the same relation to his power of healing as a cleric&#39;s divinity has to his power of influencing conduct.</p><p>You may not be able to read a doctor&#39;s handwriting and prescription, but you&#39;ll notice his bills are neatly typewritten.</p><p>Modern medicine is a negation of health. It isn&#39;t organized to serve human health, but only itself, as an institution. It makes more people sick than it heals.</p><p>Whenever a doctor cannot do good, he must be kept from doing harm.</p><p>The best doctor is the one you run to and can&#39;t find.</p><p>I was going to have cosmetic surgery until I noticed that the doctor&#39;s office was full of portraits by Picasso.</p><p>As a medical doctor, it is my duty to evaluate the situation with as much data as I can gather and as much expertise as I have and as much experience as I have to determine whether or not the wish of the patient is medically justified.</p><p>Time is generally the best doctor.</p><p>My doctor gave me six months to live, but when I couldn&#39;t pay the bill he gave me six months more.</p><p>When I told my doctor I couldn&#39;t afford an operation, he offered to touch-up my X-rays.</p><p>The great secret of doctors, known only to their wives, but still hidden from the public, is that most things get better by themselves most things, in fact, are better in the morning.</p><p>Medicine sometimes snatches away health, sometimes gives it.</p><p>I was always shocked when I went to the doctor&#39;s office and they did my X-ray and didn&#39;t find that I had eight more ribs than I should have or that my blood was the color green.</p><p>In the name of Hypocrites, doctors have invented the most exquisite form of torture ever known to man: survival.</p><p>The doctors x-rayed my head and found nothing.</p><p>I&#39;m 86 and my doctor used to tell me to slow down - at least he did until he dropped dead.</p><p>Some people think that doctors and nurses can put scrambled eggs back in the shell.</p><p>You can die of the cure before you die of the illness.</p><p>People are so afraid of authority figures and doctors are authority figures.</p><p>The physician&#39;s highest calling, his only calling, is to make sick people healthy - to heal, as it is termed.</p><p>It is reasonable to expect the doctor to recognize that science may not have all the answers to problems of health and healing.</p><p>Growing up, my dolls were doctors and on secret missions. I had Barbie Goes Rambo.</p><p>When a man goes through six years training to be a doctor he will never be the same. He knows too much.</p><p>Flying back from New York, the flight attendant said &#39;God, I wished you were here yesterday, we had a stroke on the plane. I said, if I have a stroke on a plane, I hope the pretend doctor isn&#39;t the one on the plane. I want a real doctor.</p><p>America has the best doctors, the best nurses, the best hospitals, the best medical technology, the best medical breakthrough medicines in the world. There is absolutely no reason we should not have in this country the best health care in the world.</p><p>I went to the doctor and he said I had acute appendicitis, and I said compared to who?</p><p>I&#39;m strongly for a patient Bill of Rights. Decisions ought to be made by doctors, not accountants.</p><p>I&#39;m by no means condemning prescription medicine for mental health. I&#39;ve seen it save a lot of people&#39;s lives.</p><p>Mammograms are really sort of a gift. You can either catch something early or count your lucky stars because nothing was discovered. Either way, you&#39;re ahead of the game.</p><p>If you look at the human condition today, not everyone is well fed, has access to good medical care, or the physical basics that provide for a healthy and a happy life.</p><p>Passion, you see, can be destroyed by a doctor. It cannot be created.</p><p>In the sick room, ten cents&#39; worth of human understanding equals ten dollars&#39; worth of medical science.</p><p>Medical liability reform is not a Republican or Democrat issue or even a doctor versus lawyer issue. It is a patient issue.</p><p>The art of medicine was to be properly learned only from its practice and its exercise.</p><p>A pregnant woman facing the most dire circumstances must be able to count on her doctor to do what is medically necessary to protect her from serious physical harm.</p><p>I got the bill for my surgery. Now I know what those doctors were wearing masks for.</p><p>Honestly, being a doctor could make you more close minded than regular people.</p><p>As a physician, I know many doctors want to utilize new technology, but they find the cost prohibitive.</p><p>I regret to this day that I never went to college. I feel I should have been a doctor.</p><p>One has a greater sense of degradation after an interview with a doctor than from any human experience.</p><p>Doctors coin money when they do procedures but family medicine doesn&#39;t have any procedures.</p><p>If you want total security, go to prison. There you&#39;re fed, clothed, given medical care and so on. The only thing lacking... is freedom.</p><p>The Christian&#39;s Bible is a drug store. Its contents remain the same, but the medical practice changes.</p><p>You know, if I listened to Michael Dukakis long enough, I would be convinced we&#39;re in an economic downturn and people are homeless and going without food and medical attention and that we&#39;ve got to do something about the unemployed.</p><p>These technologies can make life easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise. You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups, get medical information, the latest experimental drugs. These things can profoundly influence life. I&#39;m not downplaying that.</p><p>We can&#39;t get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can&#39;t just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.</p><p>I had the privilege of practicing medicine in the early &#39;60s, before we had any government. It worked rather well, and there was nobody on the street suffering with no medical care.</p><p>If you&#39;re so pro-life, do me a favour: don&#39;t lock arms and block medical clinics. If you&#39;re so pro-life, lock arms and block cemeteries.</p><p>Whenever the people are for gay marriage or medical marijuana or assisted suicide, suddenly the &#39;will of the people&#39; goes out the window.</p><p>The rich man&#39;s dog gets more in the way of vaccination, medicine and medical care than do the workers upon whom the rich man&#39;s wealth is built.</p><p>Vaccination is the medical sacrament corresponding to baptism. Whether it is or is not more efficacious I do not know.</p><p>Folks, the most insidious part of this whole health care scheme is that all of these vast medical expenditures will become nothing more than government budget items. We individuals will no longer exist. The relationship between a government and citizen will change forever.</p><p>Completeness? Happiness? These words don&#39;t come close to describing my emotions. There truly is nothing I can say to capture what motherhood means to me, particularly given my medical history.</p><p>A Harvard Medical School study has determined that rectal thermometers are still the best way to tell a baby&#39;s temperature. Plus, it really teaches the baby who&#39;s boss.</p><p>I went to medical school because I wanted to ask the big questions. Do we have a soul? Does God exist? What happens after death?</p><p>No one should have to choose between medicine and other necessities. No one should have to use the emergency room every time a child gets sick. And no one should have to live in constant fear that a medical problem will become a financial crisis.</p><p>Medical science has proven time and again that when the resources are provided, great progress in the treatment, cure, and prevention of disease can occur.</p><p>It seems sensible to me that we should look to the medical profession, that over the centuries has helped us to live longer and healthier lives, to help us die peacefully among our loved ones in our own home without a long stay in God&#39;s waiting room.</p><p>I believe it should be possible for someone stricken with a serious and ultimately fatal illness to choose to die peacefully with medical help, rather than suffer.</p><p>Finish last in your league and they call you idiot. Finish last in medical school and they call you doctor.</p><p>A retired teacher paid $62,000 towards her pension and nothing, yes nothing, for full family medical, dental and vision coverage over her entire career. What will we pay her? $1.4 million in pension benefits and another $215,000 in health care benefit premiums over her lifetime.</p><p>The medical literature tells us that the most effective ways to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer&#39;s, and many more problems are through healthy diet and exercise. Our bodies have evolved to move, yet we now use the energy in oil instead of muscles to do our work.</p><p>Against the State, against the Church, against the silence of the medical profession, against the whole machinery of dead institutions of the past, the woman of today arises.</p><p>Stay out of the sun, because it is the worst thing in terms of aging. I&#39;m very medical. I come from a medical family.</p><p>What&#39;s important at the grocery store is just as important in engines or medical systems. If the customer isn&#39;t satisfied, if the stuff is getting stale, if the shelf isn&#39;t right, or if the offerings aren&#39;t right, it&#39;s the same thing. You manage it like a small organization. You don&#39;t get hung up on zeros.</p><p>Information on how to heal autism and how to possibly delay vaccines or prevent autism shouldn&#39;t come from me. It should come from the medical establishment.</p><p>I have been recently diagnosed with Sjogren&#39;s Syndrome, an autoimmune disease which is an ongoing medical condition that affects my energy level and causes fatigue and joint pain.</p><p>Civil and political rights are critical, but not often the real problem for the destitute sick. My patients in Haiti can now vote but they can&#39;t get medical care or clean water.</p><p>I know we can&#39;t always know what medical surprises may happen during childbirth. But my hope is to go fully natural - no epidural, no interventions. Wish me luck.</p><p>But I contend that if we&#39;re providing total medical coverage for every man, woman, and child in Iraq, shouldn&#39;t we at least be doing the same thing for every man, woman, and child in the United States?</p><p>Money has transformed every watchdog, every independent authority. Medical doctors are increasingly gulled by the lobbying of pharmaceutical salesmen.</p><p>Liberal that I am, I support health-care reform on its merits alone. My liberal blood boils, for example, when I read that half of the personal bankruptcies in this country are brought on, in part, by medical expenses.</p><p>My dad&#39;s a doctor, and when I was 8, I went to one of his medical conferences where they were demonstrating laser surgery on a chicken. I was so mad that a chicken had to die, I never ate meat again.</p><p>I first wanted to be a psychiatrist. I decided against that in medical school when I discovered that psychiatrists didn&#39;t, in reality, do what they did on TV.</p><p>Over the years my mother&#39;s steadfast faith in God has inspired me, particularly when I had to perform extremely difficult surgical procedures or when I found myself faced with my own medical scare.</p><p>I think first and foremost everybody should understand that Canadians are strongly committed to the system of universal health insurance, to the principle that your ability to pay does not determine your access to critical medical service.</p><p>The best way to reduce the cost of medical care is to reduce the illness.</p><p>If we can reduce the cost and improve the quality of medical technology through advances in nanotechnology, we can more widely address the medical conditions that are prevalent and reduce the level of human suffering.</p><p>My parents and grandparents have always been engaged in teaching or the medical profession or the priesthood, so I&#39;ve sort of grown up with a sense of complicity in the lives of other people, so there&#39;s no virtue in that it&#39;s the way one is raised.</p><p>Medical knowledge and technical savvy are biodegradable. The sort of medicine that was practiced in Boston or New York or Atlanta fifty years ago would be as strange to a medical student or intern today as the ceremonial dance of a !Kung San tribe would seem to a rock festival audience in Hackensack.</p><p>The dilemma of modern medicine, and the underlying central flaw in medical education and, most of all, in the training of interns, is the irresistible drive to do something, anything. It is expected by patients and too often agreed to by their doctors, in the face of ignorance.</p><p>It worries me about our unwillingness to really address reforms and modernization in Medicare. This thing was designed 37 years ago. It has not evolved to keep pace with current medical technology.</p><p>Mind you, I&#39;ve always been a very off-message type of fat broad one who gladly admits she reached the size she is now solely through lack of discipline and love of pleasure, and who rather despises people (except those with proven medical conditions) who pretend that it is generally otherwise.</p><p>One goes through school, college, medical school and one&#39;s internship learning little or nothing about goodness but a good deal about success.</p><p>There have been some medical schools in which somewhere along the assembly line, a faculty member has informed the students, not so much by what he said but by what he did, that there is an intimate relation between curing and caring.</p><p>It is clear that the pharmaceutical industry is not, by any stretch of the imagination, doing enough to ensure that the poor have access to adequate medical care.</p><p>The main reason for the failure of the modern medical science is that it is dealing with results and not causes. Nothing more than the patching up of those attacked and the burying of those who are slain, without a thought being given to the real strong hold.</p><p>I read Freud&#39;s Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis in basically one sitting. I decided to enroll in medical school. It was almost like a conversion experience.</p><p>Citizens must pressure the American Hospital Association, the American Public Health Association, the Centers for Disease Control and other relevant governmental agencies to make greening our hospitals and medical centers a top priority so that they themselves don&#39;t create even more illness.</p><p>We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.</p><p>I have written two medical novels. I have never studied medicine, never seen an operation.</p><p>Medical debts are the number-one cause of bankruptcy in America.</p><p>I took anatomy classes. I went to medical libraries and talked to doctors and nutritionists. I did the whole thing before using myself as a human guinea pig.</p><p>The patient&#39;s autonomy always, always should be respected, even if it is absolutely contrary - the decision is contrary to best medical advice and what the physician wants.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to knock the medical profession into accepting its responsibilities, and those responsibilities include assisting their patients with death.</p><p>And as a nurse, I know very well the importance, for example, of electronic medical records.</p><p>I mean, everybody should have access to medical care. And, you know, it shouldn&#39;t be such a big deal.</p><p>Researches tested a new form of medical marijuana that treats pain but doesn&#39;t get the user high, prompting patients who need medical marijuana to declare, &#39;Thank you?&#39;</p><p>As far as hypnosis is concerned, I had a very serious problem when I was in my twenties. I encountered a man who later became the president of the American Society of Medical Hypnosis. He couldn&#39;t hypnotize me.</p><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any independent cartoonist whose stuff I don&#39;t like or respect in at least some way or another. We&#39;re all marginal laborers - we&#39;re practically medical oddities - so I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t all be nice to each other.</p><p>President Obama and his radical feminist enforcers have had it in for Catholic medical providers from the get-go. It&#39;s about time all people of faith fought back against this unprecedented encroachment on religious liberty. First, they came for the Catholics. Who&#39;s next?</p><p>The public has lost faith in the ability of Social Security and Medicare to provide for old age. They&#39;ve lost faith in the banking system and in conventional medical insurance.</p><p>Five thousand people every day lose their home because of a medical bankruptcy. Most of them had insurance.</p><p>Medical professionals, not insurance company bureaucrats, should be making health care decisions.</p><p>We have the greatest hospitals, doctors, and medical technology in the world - we need to make them accessible to every American.</p><p>Remember, I&#39;m a doctor&#39;s daughter. So obviously I&#39;m interested in all medical things.</p><p>It was my Uncle George who discovered that alcohol was a food well in advance of modern medical thought.</p><p>I am very abnormal... But it wasn&#39;t very long ago that I wasn&#39;t so abnormal. I was very normal and headed for a lifetime of paying medical bills as proof of my normalcy.</p><p>The Google algorithm was a significant development. I&#39;ve had thank-you emails from people whose lives have been saved by information on a medical website or who have found the love of their life on a dating website.</p><p>Today, all patients accepted for treatment at St. Jude&#39;s are treated without regard for the family&#39;s ability to pay. Everything beyond what is covered by insurance is taken care of, and for those without insurance, all of the medical costs are absorbed by the hospital.</p><p>Many of us are alarmed at the skyrocketing cost of medical care, including patients, who are the consumers. However, medical malpractice is not the reason for these increasing costs.</p><p>In our own state, we came up with, I think, what was a very novel approach to closing the gap on the uninsured. To harmonize medical records - which was a major step in getting costs out of the system.</p><p>I basically believe the medical insurance industry should be nonprofit, not profit-making. There is no way a health reform plan will work when it is implemented by an industry that seeks to return money to shareholders instead of using that money to provide health care.</p><p>To date, embryonic stem cell research has not produced a single medical treatment, where ethical, adult stem cell research has produced some 67 medical miracles.</p><p>Here in Silicon Valley, I have taken part in hundreds of conversations trying to convince people to dive in and become entrepreneurs. All too often, innovators with good, safe, jobs are unwilling to put their family&#39;s access to health care at risk by walking away from company-backed medical insurance.</p><p>Synergy and serendipity often play a big part in medical and scientific advances.</p><p>Advances in science and medical research and public health policies have meant that life expectancy for Australians is one of the highest in the world.</p><p>Over 120 Aboriginal communities run their own health services - some have been doing so for 30 years. They struggle with difficult medical problems. They also try to deal with counselling, stolen generations issues, family relationships, violence, suicide prevention.</p><p>Because I am not formally trained in the medical sciences, I can bring in new ideas to AIDS research and the cross-fertilization of ideas from different fields could be a valuable contribution to finding the cure for AIDS.</p><p>If I&#39;m pushed, I&#39;d also have to admit I don&#39;t like people with allergies. They just annoy me. There seems to be something far too self-centred about it. &#39;No thanks, I&#39;m allergic.&#39; Why not just say &#39;No thanks&#39;? I wasn&#39;t asking for your medical history, I was just passing around the nuts. Trying to be friendly, that&#39;s all.</p><p>Haiti is always talking about decentralization and nothing has been so obvious, perhaps a weakness, as the centralized nature of Haitian society as being revealed by the earthquake. I mean, they lost all these medical training programs because they didn&#39;t have them anywhere else.</p><p>The growth of technology is such that it is not possible today for a nuclear physicist to switch into medical physics without training. The field is now much more technical. More training is needed to do the job.</p><p>It&#39;s interesting when people make comments about celebrities&#39; weight gain or lack of weight gain as if they&#39;re a medical professional that&#39;s treating that celebrity. Like, &#39;This doctor does not treat Jessica Simpson, but thinks her weight is unhealthy.&#39; If you don&#39;t treat her, then how do you know?</p><p>No one wants to go back to a situation where, if you have a pre-existing medical condition, you, you can be deprived of coverage. No one wants to go back to a situation where, if you get seriously ill, you can get thrown off your insurance. Seniors don&#39;t want to go back to paying more for their prescription drugs.</p><p>There is an element of anger among women who&#39;ve been raped. There&#39;s certainly a major element of humiliation. But it really does seem like a medical condition of shock and horror.</p><p>Yet it looks as if the thing we use to solve our problems with is the source of our problems. It&#39;s like going to the doctor and having him make you ill. In fact, in 20% of medical cases we do apparently have that going on. But in the case of thought, its far over 20%.</p><p>Abortion is inherently different from other medical procedures because no other procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.</p><p>My mother was told she couldn&#39;t go to medical school because she was a woman and a Jew. So she became a teacher in the New York City public school system.</p><p>Medical decisions have been politicized. What doctor wants a state legislator in his consulting room?</p><p>I do not believe that Congress or the Administration should prohibit the medical community from pursuing a promising avenue of research that may improve the lives of millions of Americans.</p><p>When I went to the University, the medical school was the only place where one could hope to find the means to study life, its nature, its origins, and its ills.</p><p>I&#39;d come out of the army after five years as a medic. I was a medical administrator and we ran hospitals, and I was a Captain in the army at the end, in 1945.</p><p>We also have a program in place for low income people. A family of four making $26,000 a year can receive medical coverage, irrespective of citizenship or what documents.</p><p>If someone lives in New York, he&#39;s a New Yorker - they are entitled to the best medical system in the world.</p><p>The World Health Organisation has a lot of its medical experts sitting in Geneva while hospitals in Africa have no drugs and desperate patients are forced to seek medication on the black market.</p><p>Listening to medical facts was not enough. People wanted one hundred percent guarantees.</p><p>During a trip to Iraq last fall, I visited our theater hospital at Balad Air Force Base and witnessed these skilled medical professionals in action and met the brave soldiers whose lives they saved.</p><p>If we don&#39;t change, millions of American families are just one medical emergency, or one layoff, away from financial disaster and bankruptcy.</p><p>When I took command in Vietnam, I gave great emphasis to food and medical care - and to the mail.</p><p>In my second year, after moving to the Medical School, I began the courses of Anatomy and Physiology. I had begun to see that I was interested in cells and their functions.</p><p>As a player, I was fortunate to work with coaching and medical staffs that underscored the importance of utilizing injury prevention exercises, which contributed to my healthy and long playing career.</p><p>For my convalescence, I had to exercise my voice only with vowels. It is a medical rule after a long loss of voice.</p><p>When I was born in 1970 with a rare genetic disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SED), medical science wasn&#39;t what it is today and my mum and dad were treated terribly by the medical profession.</p><p>Developments in medical technology have long been confined to procedural or pharmaceutical advances, while neglecting a most basic and essential component of medicine: patient information management.</p><p>The Navy&#39;s paid for you to go through school, and then they need doctors to go out and take care of people who are in various different parts of the world. I decided to pay back my time first as an undersea medical officer. I was stationed in Scotland.</p><p>Only medical hypnosis is capable of opening up amnesia.</p><p>Today we see a human population of over 6 billion people, many of whom have serious medical conditions, which either can&#39;t be treated or cannot be treated economically.</p><p>I can help a lot of other people who&#39;ve gone through the same thing by building a center that will help men and women who don&#39;t have the funds to take care of themselves and get the medical treatment.</p><p>Long gone are the days when hospital stays and surgeries made up the bulk of seniors&#39; annual medical expenses.</p><p>Without true medical liability reform, our doctors will continue to leave, and young doctors coming out of medical school $100,000 to $200,000 in debt will not be able to afford such onerous costs.</p><p>Informed consent is required for every invasive medical procedure, from getting your ears pierced to having an abortion.</p><p>The whole story of the comfort women, the system of forced sexual slavery, the medical experiments of Unit 731, is not something that is in the US psyche. That is changing because many books are coming out.</p><p>I decided to start a medical training program for freelancers, only freelancers. They&#39;re the ones who are doing most of the combat reporting. They&#39;re taking most of the risks. They&#39;re absorbing most of the casualties. And they&#39;re the most underserved and under-resourced of everyone in the entire news business.</p><p>Corporate governance is a huge issue too. We don&#39;t have women on these corporate boards. More than half of the students in law school are women, more than half of the women, I think, in medical school now are women.</p><p>With tens of thousands of patients dying every year from preventable medical errors, it is imperative that we embrace available technologies and drastically improve the way medical records are handled and processed.</p><p>We cannot sacrifice innocent human life now for vague and exaggerated promises of medical treatments thirty of forty years from now. There are ways to pursue this technology and respect life at the same time.</p><p>The great medical facilities are a relief for the parents, too, who don&#39;t have to think about caring for their young ones on their own for a weekend. They have a great time.</p><p>Community health centers do a great deal with limited resources. They provide critical medical care services to many who would otherwise have no other place to go or would end up in an emergency room.</p><p>For many people, managing pain involves using prescription medicine in combination with complementary techniques like physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga and massage. I appreciate this because I truly believe medical care should address the person as a whole - their mind, body, and spirit.</p><p>When I talked to my medical friends about the strange silence on this subject in American medical magazines and textbooks, I gained the impression that here was a subject tainted with Socialism or with feminine sentimentality for the poor.</p><p>Oh there are lots of doctors and medical professionals out there who buy my devices at whole sale price.</p><p>Immortality Device has been tested and researched by medical researchers all over the world from time to time. They email me and told me what they found. I post their results sometimes on my site.</p><p>That&#39;s the thing. in medicine, you&#39;re used to saying there&#39;s a problem within the person, and saying there&#39;s a problem within the culture, that&#39;s not a medical answer. Medicine has to look in one direction, so there&#39;s only one type of answer that they can find.</p><p>I founded a launch company called International Microspace when I graduated medical school in 1989. We were trying to build a microsatellite launcher.</p><p>I&#39;ve been advised not to have any more children for medical reasons, so that&#39;s it - the shop has closed, even though I would have loved a daughter.</p><p>Ensuring Americans have access to adequate medical care should be a priority for all of us.</p><p>I&#39;d visit the near future, close enough that someone might want to talk to Larry Niven and can figure out the language distant enough to get me decent medical techniques and a ticket to the Moon.</p><p>Procedures outside the stadiums and in the parking areas still need to be optimized, for example so that emergency medical services can leave the grounds on their way to the hospital faster.</p><p>Prior to penicillin and medical research, death was an everyday occurrence. It was intimate.</p><p>Failure to properly control our borders costs citizens in many ways: schools become overcrowded, medical resources are stretched too thin, other government services are overtaxed, and taxes increase further.</p><p>Another cause of change, one less noticeable but fundamental, is the modern growth of population closely connected with scientific and medical discoveries. It is interesting that the United Nations has set up a special Commission to study this question.</p><p>Nobody could tell us or really had a very good idea, if there were a massive release of radiation, what kind of medical treatment people were going to need and this or that, or, indeed, whether there would be medical personnel around.</p><p>Harvard Medical School, the University of South Florida and the American Psychiatric Association have all conducted studies showing that the earlier one begins gambling, the more likely it is he or she will become an addicted, problem gambler.</p><p>As a former professional patient advocate, I believe prescription drugs are an essential part of high-quality medical treatment, and I supported enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act.</p><p>The sacrifices made by veterans and their willingness to fight in defense of our nation merit our deep respect and praise - and to the best in benefits and medical care.</p><p>Medical physics is an applied area of physics.</p><p>Most medical physicists work in the physics of radiation oncology making sure that the desired dose is given to the cancer and the dose to normal tissues are minimized.</p><p>Medical physicists work in cooperation with doctors. A few medical physicists devote their time to research and teaching. A few get involved with administrative duties.</p><p>I am sure that I have been much more useful to society as a medical physicist.</p><p>When I entered medical physics in 1958 there were fewer than 100 in the U.S. and I could see many opportunities to apply my knowledge of nuclear physics.</p><p>I was the Chair of the first department of medical physics in a medical school in the U.S.</p><p>I have devoted much time and energy to helping medical physics in developing countries.</p><p>There are now over 5,000 medical physicists in the U.S more than 50 times the number in 1958.</p><p>It is my sincere hope that hospitals across Indiana, and America, continue to strive for excellence when it comes to providing medical care.

We owe these improvements to decades of investment in medical research.</p><p>After I read all the medical journals and watched all the documentaries, I still didn&#39;t understand the physical sensation of ticking and where it comes from and what it feels like.</p><p>Reform of the medical liability system should be considered as part of a comprehensive response to surging medical malpractice premiums that endanger Americans&#39; access to quality medical care.</p><p>I unfortunately had a lot of medical procedures throughout my life, so I decided to paint all of my surgeries as a way to heal and as a way to grow.</p><p>Now a cholera epidemic was sweeping through Southeast Asia and south Asia in the early 1970s, so I started medical school and I joined a laboratory to work on this.</p><p>The logic is often far-fetched - how does medical marijuana affect interstate commerce? - and some conservatives would like judges to start throwing out federal laws wholesale on commerce clause grounds.

But, I never got a college scholarship.</p><p>Just the actual physical ability to hold four instruments simultaneously and do some of the things that Vivien was able to do is mind blowing to any surgeon. He never went to medical school and he became one of the great teachers of medicine himself, people are just amazed.</p><p>The fact that he didn&#39;t get credit for a while is more the story of social injustice. But his own spirit wasn&#39;t driven by that, and wasn&#39;t dependent upon that.

When people talk about technology, that&#39;s where I start to get a little hot under the collar because I know that it&#39;s the key to solving some of the world&#39;s biggest problems. Having a faster, thinner telephone is not one of the world&#39;s biggest problems.</p><p>I set up a laboratory in the Department of Physiology in the Medical School in South Africa and begin to try to find a bacteriophage system which we might use to solve the genetic code.</p><p>The government can still conduct clandestine searches of innocent people&#39;s private information such as library, medical, and financial records. This is wrong and should have been addressed in a true compromise.</p><p>Today, it is research with human embryonic stem cells and attempts to prepare cloned stem cells for research and medical therapies that are being disavowed as being ethically unacceptable.</p><p>After wrestling with myself for six months, I began medical treatment.

Parents should address this issue and ask their children to discuss how they feel about themselves.</p><p>Quite frankly, Barack Obama knows what it&#39;s like to pay a mortgage and student loans.

Talk to your friends, neighbors, family, and together you attack it. We can&#39;t always control what happens to us, but we can always control how we react to it.</p><p>I have many times thought I did the wrong thing, but the reason was not to be a medical doctor - it was just to have the information. But then, maybe I was wrong, I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Canadians have been very generous toward Haiti after the earthquake and, thanks to you, our most vulnerable people have received food, drinkable water, shelter, medical care and education.

I know where to go to get the information that I need.</p><p>When families save, they can get through emergencies like a bad harvest or a medical emergency. But it&#39;s more than that. They can also plan for the future, gradually saving up for a small business or for their children&#39;s school tuition.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe medical discoveries are doing much to advance human life. As fast as we create ways to extend it we are inventing ways to shorten it.</p><p>The bill would ban human cloning, and any attempts at human cloning, for both reproductive purposes and medical research. Also forbidden is the importing of cloned embryos or products made from them.</p><p>On bad days, I think I&#39;d like to be a plastic surgeon who goes to Third World countries and operates on children in villages with airlifts, and then I think, &#39;Yeah, right, I&#39;m going to go back to undergraduate school and take all the biology I missed and then go to medical school.&#39; No. No.</p><p>And it was back in the mid-1980s, and as I point out in a piece, that was when we are spending about eight percent of our gross domestic product on health care.

If it was new, what did that say about the state of medical knowledge? And in any case, how could physicians make sense of it?</p><p>Medical research in the twentieth century mostly takes place in the lab in the Renaissance, though, researchers went first and foremost to the library to see what the ancients had said.</p><p>The sort of thinking at the time was, &#39;Well, we&#39;re giving you access to medical care which you wouldn&#39;t otherwise be able to get, so your payment is that we get to use you in research.&#39;</p><p>We ought to be providing protective sanctuaries for the Kurdish rebels.

I can talk to my mom more than any of my friends could talk to their parents.</p><p>I&#39;m so happy and thankful I made it a point be a stay-at-home mom.</p><p>I&#39;d lose my mind if I heard my kid call the nanny Mommy.</p><p>My mother told me on several different occasions that she was livin&#39; her dream vicariously through me. She once said that I was getting&#39; to do all the things that she would have wanted to have done.</p><p>My parents, especially my mother, were no influence on me whatsoever.</p><p>Motherhood is at its best when the tender chords of sympathy have been touched.</p><p>Morality and its victim, the mother - what a terrible picture! Is there indeed anything more terrible, more criminal, than our glorified sacred function of motherhood?</p><p>The man in our society is the breadwinner the woman has enough to do as the homemaker, wife and mother.</p><p>I stand fearlessly for small dogs, the American Flag, motherhood and the Bible. That&#39;s why people love me.</p><p>My mother thinks I could have even run a larger company.</p><p>My mom taught us the Serenity Prayer at a young age.</p><p>What motivated me? My mother. My mother was an immigrant woman, a peasant woman, struggled all her life, worked in the garment center.</p><p>The woman is uniformly sacrificed to the wife and mother.</p><p>I&#39;m sure that my mom would have been happy with any path I chose.</p><p>I auditioned on my own. I tried to make a mark for myself without anybody&#39;s help, not even Mom&#39;s.</p><p>Giving birth was easier than having a tattoo.</p><p>If my mom reads that I&#39;m grammatically incorrect I&#39;ll have hell to pay.</p><p>If you ever become a mother, can I have one of the puppies?</p><p>I&#39;d go to, like, six different schools in one year. We were on welfare, and my mom never ever worked.</p><p>We need somebody who&#39;s got the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it&#39;s like to be a young teenage mom, the empathy to understand what it&#39;s like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old - and that&#39;s the criterion by which I&#39;ll be selecting my judges.</p><p>Dad needs to show an incredible amount of respect and humor and friendship toward his mate so the kids understand their parents are sexy, they&#39;re fun, they do things together, they&#39;re best friends. Kids learn by example. If I respect Mom, they&#39;re going to respect Mom.</p><p>Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That&#39;s how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose.</p><p>My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would be, and much less about what we would do.</p><p>A guy is a lump like a doughnut. So, first you gotta get rid of all the stuff his mom did to him. And then you gotta get rid of all that macho crap that they pick up from beer commercials. And then there&#39;s my personal favorite, the male ego.</p><p>When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, &#39;Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation?&#39;</p><p>Being a Hot Mom means being respected as a mom and a woman. And, the key to being a Hot Mom is having a sense of humor about yourself and all the crazy situations that arise.</p><p>I believe this with all my heart: The greatest coach of all time in my eyes is my mom. She&#39;s instilled in me a toughness and a perseverance and just a never-quit mentality, and I thank her every day for providing me, for what she sacrificed her life for.</p><p>My mom was such a strong character. I don&#39;t want to say she was like a man, but she was tough.</p><p>My mom and I have always been really close. She&#39;s always been the friend that was always there. There were times when, in middle school and junior high, I didn&#39;t have a lot of friends. But my mom was always my friend. Always.</p><p>For everything I do, I think about a 6-year-old girl and her mom that I saw at my concert last night. I think about what those two individuals would think if I were at a club last night. I never want to be arrested, and I never want to get a DUI, those are my moral values.</p><p>It was my 16th birthday - my mom and dad gave me my Goya classical guitar that day. I sat down, wrote this song, and I just knew that that was the only thing I could ever really do - write songs and sing them to people.</p><p>As a mom, I know it is my responsibility, and no one else&#39;s, to raise my kids. But we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean when so many parents are finding their best efforts undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at our kids.</p><p>One of the greatest titles in the world is parent, and one of the biggest blessings in the world is to have parents to call mom and dad.</p><p>I love those hockey moms. You know what they say the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is? Lipstick.</p><p>For me, already being part of a single parent household and knowing it was just me and my mom, you&#39;d would wake up times and hope that the next day you&#39;d be able to be alongside your mother because she was out trying to make sure that I was taken care of. But all I cared about was her being home.</p><p>Don&#39;t let people disrespect you. My mom says don&#39;t open the door to the devil. Surround yourself with positive people.</p><p>Having a child makes you realize the importance of life - narcissism goes out the window. Heaven on earth is looking at my little boy. The minute he was born, I knew if I never did anything other than being a mom, I&#39;d be fine.</p><p>My mom and I had the same vision, and we want the same things. We would always make a goal list every year.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be perfect, but I do want to be a role model. My mom always tells me that imperfections equal beauty. All of us are imperfect.</p><p>When you are getting ready to become a mom, being in love with someone just isn&#39;t enough. You need to think about whether he would be a good parent and raise your children with similar beliefs.</p><p>My sisters and my mom, those people help me get through every single day.</p><p>&quot;I told my mom, &#39;I&#39;m not buying another magazine until I can get past this thought of looking like the girl on the cover&#39;. She said, &quot;&quot;Miley, you are the girl on the cover,&#39; and I was, like, &#39;I know, but I don&#39;t feel like that girl every day.&#39; You can&#39;t always feel perfect.&quot;</p><p>When love is gone, there&#39;s always justice. And when justice is gone, there&#39;s always force. And when force is gone, there&#39;s always Mom. Hi, Mom!</p><p>I love my mom. My mom loves me. We don&#39;t have an easy relationship. I don&#39;t think we ever will, but I&#39;d rather have a complicated, misunderstood relationship than have no relationship at all.</p><p>My mom never taught me to be waiting for some prince on a white horse to swipe me off my feet.</p><p>I always wanted what Mom and Dad had.</p><p>My dad is still Christian Scientist. My mom&#39;s not, and I&#39;m not. But I believe in God, and that there&#39;s a higher power and an intelligence that&#39;s bigger than us and that we can rely on. It&#39;s not just us, thinking we are the ones in control of everything. That idea gives me support.</p><p>My mom took me to see Carnal Knowledge and The Wild Bunch and all these kind of movies when I was a kid.</p><p>People think I have courage. The courage in my family are my wife Pam, my three daughters, here, Nicole, Jamie, LeeAnn, my mom, who&#39;s right here too.</p><p>When I was 5, some financial things happened, and I moved seven times in a year. We moved from apartment to apartment, sometimes living with friends. My mom would always say, &#39;Don&#39;t get comfortable, because we may not be here long.&#39;</p><p>I can only hope to be 10 percent of the mom mine was to me. She encouraged me to be confident and enjoy life. That&#39;s what I want for my son.</p><p>You know, I don&#39;t think any mother aims to be a single mom. I didn&#39;t wish for that, but it happened.</p><p>My mom decorated with lots of antiques. I never liked it when I was a little girl - I wanted to live in a modern house. But now I love it.</p><p>Looking back, I think I was always musical. My dad was very musical, and I think my mom was musical.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t so long ago that I was a working mom myself. And I know that sometimes, much as we all hate to admit it, it&#39;s just easier to park the kids in front of the TV for a few hours, so we can pay the bills or do the laundry or just have some peace and quiet for a change.</p><p>The person who has inspired me my whole life is my Mom, because she taught me commitment. She sacrificed.</p><p>My mom is always telling me it takes a long time to get to the top, but a short time to get to the bottom.</p><p>My mom and I are very close.</p><p>My mom is the backbone not just of my family but of many families.</p><p>I could get away with not taking care of myself as a bachelorette but as a mom I can&#39;t.</p><p>Mom was 50 when my Dad died. She got on a bus every weekday for years, and rode 40 miles each morning to Madison. She earned a new degree and learned new skills to start her small business. It wasn&#39;t just a new livelihood. It was a new life.</p><p>And to this day, my Mom is my role model.</p><p>A Romney-Ryan administration will protect and strengthen Medicare, for my Mom&#39;s generation, for my generation, and for my kids and yours.</p><p>What makes me happy is just curling up in with my mom in her bed and watching a marathon of &#39;CSI&#39; and &#39;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#39; episodes with pints of ice cream.</p><p>I started cooking when I was about 10. I have memories like when I was 6 or 7 with my mom, and when I was 12 I started getting real serious about cooking.</p><p>Studies show that children best flourish when one mom and one dad are there to raise them.</p><p>I know I&#39;m talented, but I wasn&#39;t put here to sing. I was put here to be a wife and a mom and look after my family. I love what I do, but it&#39;s not where it begins and ends.</p><p>My mom was tough.</p><p>When I was really young, my mom enrolled me in dance classes.</p><p>I think my love of journalizing my life comes from my mom.</p><p>My mom wasn&#39;t a movie star.</p><p>I became a mom at 37 and having a child has been an emancipation for me.</p><p>My inspiration was my mom. She&#39;s a great cook, and she still cooks, and we still banter back and forth about cooking. Growing up in a mostly Portuguese community, food was important and the family table was extremely important. At a very young age I understood that.</p><p>My parents were working class folks. My dad was a bartender for most of his life, my mom was a maid and a cashier and a stock clerk at WalMart. We were not people of financial means in terms of significant financial means. I always told them, &#39;I didn&#39;t always have what I wanted. I always had what I needed.&#39; My parents always provided that.</p><p>My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a maid and a stock clerk at K-Mart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful. Because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them.</p><p>My mom and I have always been very close. She is my best friend. She had to make a lot of sacrifices early on in my life to make sure I got to do what I wanted to do.</p><p>My mom brought me up to believe that my talent is a gift and a blessing.</p><p>Thankfully, I have my mom and a small group of close friends who are there for me 24/7 and whom I can trust and depend on.</p><p>I remember watching the Grammys and looking at the performances and crying to my mom, saying how much I wanted to be there.</p><p>I always wanted to be a mom.</p><p>When I was younger, I had a perm, and it was really big. My mom was a hairdresser, so even my dad had a perm! I looked like a poodle, but it was cool at the time.</p><p>I&#39;m a lioness. I have four cubs. I&#39;m a mom. I want to take care of my kids and protect them.</p><p>My mom is at my house every day, and she nags me about everything, especially hygiene.</p><p>I remember driving to North Carolina when I was a little girl in a snowstorm to get down to my mom&#39;s family in the Carolinas. There were chains on the car - it was the late sixties - and we were just singing in the car. Christmas carols.</p><p>When I was little, my mom tells me, I used to say things like, &#39;Mom do you hear the string section? Do you hear the string section?&#39; And she would look at me and say, &#39;No honey, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#39;</p><p>Being the only man in the household with my mom definitely helped me grow up fast.</p><p>If I could get any animal it would be a dolphin. I want one so bad. Me and my mom went swimming with dolphins and I was like, &#39;How do we get one of those?&#39; and she was like, &#39;You can&#39;t get a dolphin. What are you gonna do, like, put it in your pool?&#39;</p><p>I&#39;m not a religious person. My mom was of Jewish blood and my dad was Protestant.</p><p>My dad believes in God, I think. I&#39;m not sure if my mom does. I don&#39;t.</p><p>Fortunately, when you&#39;re a mom, the responsibility of caring for your child can keep you going.</p><p>My mom has made it possible for me to be who I am. Our family is everything. Her greatest skill was encouraging me to find my own person and own independence.</p><p>I forgive my mom for being a psycho and my dad for being a loser.</p><p>It is a sad commentary of our times when our young must seek advice and counsel from &#39;Dear Abby&#39; instead of going to Mom and Dad.</p><p>I hear my friends and my mom tell me I&#39;m special, but honestly, I still don&#39;t get it.</p><p>My mom and I have always been there for each other. We had some tough times, but she was always there for me.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to have kids for like 10 years. I still have a lot to do. I don&#39;t even know if I could handle a dog right now. I&#39;m so not ready. Someday I&#39;ll be a mom but not until I&#39;m in my 30s.</p><p>As a mom I know that raising children is the hardest job there is.</p><p>I consider my mom and all my sisters my friends.</p><p>The best situation is being a single parent. The best part about is that you get time off, too, because the kids are with their mom, so it&#39;s the best of both worlds. There&#39;s a lot to be said for it.</p><p>My mom, Irmelin, taught me the value of life. Her own life was saved by my grandmother during World War II.</p><p>I&#39;m going to let people know that it&#39;s cool to have a child and be young and still be a good mom. It&#39;s really tough, but I&#39;m doing it.</p><p>My mom, God rest her soul - she liked nicknames. In the womb she named me Skip. There was another black guy in Piedmont, W.Va., and his name was Skip. They called him Big Skip, and I was Little Skip.</p><p>I feel like a good mom. I&#39;m a strong woman now... Don&#39;t look down on me. Pray for me because I&#39;m trying.</p><p>And the greatest lesson that mom ever taught me though was this one. She told me there would be times in your life when you have to choose between being loved and being respected. Now she said to always pick being respected.</p><p>Being a mom has made me so tired. And so happy.</p><p>My father wasn&#39;t really involved and my mom is the light in my life.</p><p>The real estate agent had to go door-to-door in the apartment building we wanted to rent, asking if it was OK for this interracial family - my mom is white and I was a 1-year-old half-African kid - to live in the apartment building.</p><p>My dad never blew anything up, but he probably had friends who did. He and my mom have always preached that the pen is mightier than a Molotov cocktail.</p><p>I grabbed my mom and I went to the couch and I said, &#39;Mom I want to ask Jesus to come into my heart.&#39; And I got on my knee and I asked Jesus to come into my heart, forgive me of my sins, and make me a child of God.</p><p>My mom used to make everything. She had a great garden and composted and made everything from scratch - peanut butter, bread, jelly, everything. I don&#39;t know how she did it because all those things take time and love and labour. I only do half the stuff she does - but there&#39;s still time.</p><p>I&#39;m a mom, so I have to be comfortable. Jeans are a staple - I have way too many in my closet! It&#39;s warm in Florida, so I wear jeans and a tank top every day. I love my True Religions, my Rich and Skinny, and Citizens of Humanity. But I also love getting dressed up!</p><p>Mom spent the time that she was supposed to be a kid actully raising children, her younger brother and younger sister. She was tough as nails and did not suffer fools at all. And the truth was she could not afford to. She spoke the truth, bluntly, directly, and without much varnish. I am her son.</p><p>I didn&#39;t understand that I could sing until I was like 11 or 12. My mom heard me singing around the house and she said, What are you doing? You really can sing! So then I started going to school and singing to the girls.</p><p>My mom being a psychotherapist, I&#39;ve been brought up with that whole psychoanalytical terrain.</p><p>I think the real heroic teachers are the ones who work with kids, like my mom and my sister do.</p><p>I probably have an earlier curfew than anyone. My mom wants to keep me really safe and my dad&#39;s not overly protective, but he&#39;s a dad no matter what.</p><p>People always accuse me of being motivational in a way, like it was a bad thing, but that&#39;s just how I was raised. My mom raised me in a positive environment, with lots of love in my heart, and that reflects in my music.</p><p>My mom used to say that I became a fighter and a scrapper and a tough guy to protect who I am at my core.</p><p>My mom knows when something is real and something is not.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had a very closely connected family. My parents split up when I was young and I was living with my mom for a little while, then I was kind of just on my own really young. It wasn&#39;t some kind of global tragedy, it was just never really a very close-knit family. So there was support in the sense that they didn&#39;t stand in my way.</p><p>I just go about my life. I&#39;m a mom, I drive an SUV, I go to the grocery store every day. I&#39;m definitely not a celebrity. I always say that I&#39;m a celebrity-adjacent.</p><p>Fact: The new &#39;90210&#39; is cooler than the old &#39;90210.&#39; It&#39;s the lithe, streamlined Skipper to the elder series&#39; venerable Barbie. Gone are the traditional parents - they&#39;ve been replaced by a hipster mom n&#39; pop who get busted necking in the car.</p><p>I make a lot of mistakes, too, and I&#39;m constantly re-evaluating how I&#39;m doing things and trying to be better every day, whether it&#39;s as a mom or taking care of myself.</p><p>Most children - I know I did when I was a kid - fantasize another set of parents. Or fantasize no parents. They don&#39;t tell their real parents about that - you don&#39;t want to tell Mom and Dad. Kids lead a very private life. And I was a typical child, I think. I was a liar.</p><p>Most children - I know I did when I was a kid - fantasize another set of parents. Or fantasize no parents. They don&#39;t tell their real parents about that - you don&#39;t want to tell Mom and Dad.</p><p>My mom and I were super tight. I think she really wanted me to be an artist, you know? She used to like to tell people she wanted to be Beethoven&#39;s mother. That was her thing. She wanted to be the mother of this person.</p><p>My dad and mom believed that you do what you have to do in private and don&#39;t make a big deal out of it. Just try to help people as much as you can.</p><p>My relationship with my mom is really the single most profound relationship that I&#39;ve ever had in my life.</p><p>My parents are wonderful, and I&#39;m really lucky - but my mom has always been almost exclusively a right-brained person. She goes completely on her feelings of things, on her intuition, and so she instilled that in my brothers and I.</p><p>My dad is a Deadhead, my mom&#39;s a Jewish-American princess from Jersey.</p><p>Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom&#39;s. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own.</p><p>My Mom said she learned how to swim when someone took her out in the lake and threw her off the boat. I said, &#39;Mom, they weren&#39;t trying to teach you how to swim.&#39;</p><p>My mom was a waitress, and my dad was a plumber who worked for the City of San Clemente fixing mains breaks, so not too glamorous.</p><p>I like to work. The self-esteem and satisfaction that I get from working makes me a better person, which makes me a better mom. I feel lucky because I have the luxury of working only one or two days a week.</p><p>I don&#39;t drink, and I don&#39;t smoke. It&#39;s a personal preference. My mom has never drunk or smoked. I look up to my mom.</p><p>I pretty much borrow my entire beauty regime from my mom.</p><p>I know my mom said as early as she can remember letting me watch TV, my one treat a week when I was like 6 was to stay up and watch &#39;Saturday Night Live.&#39;</p><p>I want to be as healthy as I can because I&#39;m a mom now.</p><p>I have so much respect for my mom and all the women across the world.</p><p>I guess now that I think back, I used to play priest and be a funny priest. I don&#39;t know, I grew up in such a Catholic family that I kind of liked to test the boundaries a little bit and I think I had fun watching my mom laugh.</p><p>When I was a little girl, rocking my little dolls, I remember thinking I would be the world&#39;s best mom, and so far I&#39;ve done it.</p><p>When I was in nursery school, the teachers asked me, y&#39;know, &#39;What does your dad do for a living?&#39; So I said &#39;He helps women get pregnant!&#39; They called my mom and they were like, &#39;What exactly does your husband do?&#39;</p><p>Like a lot of you, I grew up in a family on the ragged edges of the middle class. My daddy sold carpeting and ended up as a maintenance man. After he had a heart attack, my mom worked the phones at Sears so we could hang on to our house.</p><p>I could do without &#39;cool&#39; publications calling me &#39;mom jazz.&#39; But I laughed all the way to the bank, baby.</p><p>My mom just didn&#39;t put a very high premium on me being like really famous or really wealthy or anything.</p><p>It&#39;s not common for a woman on television, especially if she&#39;s the mom of the family, to be funny. She&#39;s usually a straight man or foil.</p><p>My mom and I used to listen to records, read, and take train rides across the country in the summer. It was a very chill life. She didn&#39;t expose me to anything that was ahead of my development, but she expected me to adjust to her world - she did not expect to adjust to mine.</p><p>Isn&#39;t it so weird the day you wake up and you&#39;re just going with the flow? And you just suddenly are a mom.</p><p>I&#39;m a sappy mom now. I didn&#39;t think I would be. I thought I&#39;d be a cool mom who keeps everything in perspective.</p><p>I was always a drama queen. I remember playing in the kitchen, trying to get my mom to think I was dead and call the police. When she didn&#39;t, I would cry. I was always theatrical. I don&#39;t think any of my relatives are surprised.</p><p>My mom knows pretty well how I see her.</p><p>I&#39;m ridiculous in my oversharing my mom and sister are very open but a little more judicious than me... and my father is a decidedly private person.</p><p>God blessed me with two unbelievable parents, and I am just like both of them. I have the smile and charisma of my mother and the big heart of my mom, because she wants to save the world and help the world, so I am just like her.</p><p>My mom was always saying: &#39;Be whatever you want to be, but stick with it. Don&#39;t waver. Don&#39;t change who you are for anybody.&#39;</p><p>My mom always says I cut my teeth on the church pew.</p><p>My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance.</p><p>Well, my mom is single and we&#39;ve both been single at the same time over the last ten years, so I really related to the bond between my character and Diane&#39;s.</p><p>I always knew I wanted kids, but when my mom passed away I was like, &#39;I want a bunch of kids. I want three kids or four kids, and I want to have that relationship again.&#39; I can&#39;t bring my mom back, but I can have children.</p><p>Not to be weird, but I still have an ongoing relationship with my mom, even though she passed away, and I&#39;ve been surprised at how much I&#39;ve been able to convey to her. Now I sound like a total weirdo, but that&#39;s true.</p><p>My mom loved rock &#39;n roll. My father hated it. We couldn&#39;t play it when he was around.</p><p>I made some truly awful movies. &#39;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&#39; was the worst. If you ever want someone to confess to murder just make him or her sit through that film. They will confess to anything after 15 minutes.</p><p>I used to say, &#39;Man, I think I&#39;d be a really good dad. I&#39;ll be a great provider. I&#39;m funny I&#39;ll go on trips with them - I&#39;ll do all sorts of stuff.&#39; But the momming? I&#39;m not made for that. I have a really good mom I know what she put into it.</p><p>Washington has got to, across the board, lower taxes for small businesses so that our mom and pops can reinvest and hire people, so that our businesses can thrive.</p><p>I&#39;m really happy to be a mom, and I&#39;m proud of the phase I&#39;m in.</p><p>Mom ran the house, so we grew up Portuguese.</p><p>My food is Louisiana, New Orleans-based, well-seasoned, rustic. I think it&#39;s pretty unique because of my background being influenced by my mom, Portuguese and French Canadian. There&#39;s a lot going on there.</p><p>My family, you know, are all still, you know, very close. We&#39;re all still very close. Mom and Daddy are still alive. So, what more can you ask for? Your kids are healthy.</p><p>I know how to do anything, I&#39;m a mom.</p><p>Being a singer is all about me. About ego. Being a mom is all about being selfless - two different worlds.</p><p>My mom used to say that Greek Easter was later because then you get stuff cheaper.</p><p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, there&#39;s no job more important on the planet than being a mom.</p><p>I didn&#39;t come from a trailer park. I grew up middle class and my dad had money and my mom made my lunch. I got a car when I was sixteen. I&#39;m proud of that.</p><p>I did find some time to go to a record store and check out &#39;Headstrong&#39; actually in the racks. It was pretty cool I never thought I&#39;d see my own CD sitting there with everyone else&#39;s. I made my Mom take lots of pics!</p><p>Once in high school, I completely over plucked my left eyebrow all the way up to where you&#39;re not supposed to. I had no idea what I was doing and it looked terrible! My mom was like &#39;What did you do to yourself?&#39; I was so embarrassed.</p><p>The &#39;believe&#39; tattoo is because my mom always told me to believe.</p><p>My mom is very confident and she was always a role model of mine.</p><p>My mom put me and my sisters in the water to feel comfortable, to have water safety.</p><p>Even in high school, I&#39;d tell my mom I was sick of swimming and wanted to try to play golf. She wasn&#39;t too happy. She&#39;d say, &#39;Think about this.&#39; And I&#39;d always end up getting back in the pool.</p><p>My humanitarian work evolved from being with my family. My mom, my dad, they really set a great example for giving back. My mom was a nurse, my dad was a school teacher. But my mom did a lot of things for geriatrics and elderly people. She would do home visits for free.</p><p>Growing up, my ideals were Barbra Streisand, Cher, and my mom.</p><p>My mom insisted on multigrain bread and never allowed soda in the house.</p><p>I was always at peace because of the way my mom treated me.</p><p>Come Christmas Eve, we usually go to my mom and dad&#39;s. Everybody brings one gift and then we play that game when we all steal it from each other. Some are really cool, others are useful and some are a bit out there.</p><p>Depending on what day of the week it is and what time of the month it is, I&#39;m a good friend or not a good friend. I&#39;m more or less a good mom or not a good mom, more or less a good mate or not a good mate. That&#39;s just life, whether or not you&#39;re public.</p><p>My mom&#39;s discipline worked out perfectly. I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.</p><p>My mom&#39;s never been married. I&#39;ve never even seen my mom kiss a dude.</p><p>If you would ask my mom what books I liked growing up, I liked Dr. Seuss.</p><p>I was born and raised in East Los Angeles by a single mom who had three biological kids and adopted four more. I never met my dad.</p><p>When I got into junior high school, that&#39;s when my mom let me dress how I wanted to dress. Up to that point I wore suits to school all the time.</p><p>I remember when I was 11, I told my mom, &#39;One day I&#39;m going to buy you a house.&#39; And she said, &#39;Boy, don&#39;t you be making promises you can&#39;t keep.&#39; I was like: &#39;No, Ma, it&#39;s not a promise. I&#39;m going to buy you a house one day.&#39;</p><p>These days it&#39;s cool to be ethnic and to be different, but when I was a kid, it was not cool - at all. My friends would come over and my mom would make crepes with eggs, stuffed with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and spinach. And they&#39;d be like, &#39;What is this?&#39;</p><p>Every time I think I have something under control, it changes and I don&#39;t have it under control. I think it takes several years to get there. Jade is 19 months old, so right now I&#39;m on alert all the time. And as a mom I think you&#39;re constantly worrying about things.</p><p>Mom and Pop were just a couple of kids when they got married. He was eighteen, she was sixteen and I was three.</p><p>I must admit, even though I&#39;m the product of two Jewish parents, I think the Irish temper got in there somewhere, so I&#39;m going to check Mom&#39;s genealogy.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know my Dad - he moved out early. And my mom&#39;s politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didn&#39;t think about Democrats or Republicans. She thought about who made sense. I&#39;ve been both in my life.</p><p>With my new venture, Club Mom, we want to empower moms to feel their value and also build their collective power to make their lives better and easier. We want to bring them together as a community to share experiences and information.</p><p>Because sorry to say, women run the house. They run the family. They hold things up. I mean, it&#39;s like you don&#39;t ever see your mom get sick because she handles everything. And it&#39;s kind of amazing I think to show people just how strong women are.</p><p>I&#39;m lucky that my real-life Mom has both a great sense of humor about herself and an amazing ability to slip into complete denial if the subject matter gets a little too close to home.</p><p>I&#39;m more straightforward, and I speak up more than I did before. When I was younger, I wouldn&#39;t speak up as much, but now that I&#39;m a mom, things have changed.</p><p>My mom is going to kill me for talking about sleeping with people. But I don&#39;t want to put myself in the position where I&#39;m in a monogamous relationship right now. I&#39;m not dating just one person. &#39;Sex and the City&#39; changed everything for me because those girls would sleep with so many people.</p><p>President Obama&#39;s fight for rural America is personal. He was raised by a single mom and grandparents from Kansas. He hails from a farming state, Illinois.</p><p>I don&#39;t have anything against my mom, but my family has no emotional connection to each other.</p><p>My mom was on welfare and the occasional food stamp, but I have never participated in any of those governmental programs, even the ones that kind of work like education, scholarships and whatever, and I managed to do just fine.</p><p>I love being a single mom. But it&#39;s definitely different when you&#39;re dating.</p><p>Yes, I always remember my dad&#39;s, mom&#39;s and my grandma&#39;s perfumes.</p><p>Financial hardships were rough on us, even though Mom had a good job at G.M.</p><p>It was always a fantasy of mine growing up - my favorite program was always &#39;Little House on the Prairie&#39; - so I always wanted to wear those looks. When I was a child, I wouldn&#39;t let my mom put me in anything but calico dresses and now... whaddaya know, every day I&#39;m in a calico dress, basically, so it&#39;s kind of funny.</p><p>You do need parental guidance and I was in a great position with both my mum and dad. They split when I was a baby but even though I stayed with my mom they were both very much involved in my upbringing.</p><p>My mom always says, &#39;If you don&#39;t believe in something, you&#39;ll lose yourself completely.&#39;</p><p>I was thinking that when I have children, that I should always dress as a character for them, so they think their mom is Alice in Wonderland or Cinderella.</p><p>It&#39;s superfun being a mom, but it&#39;s hard too.</p><p>Being a mom is hard, I think a lot of working moms feel that way.</p><p>My mom always said I was the peacemaker in the family. My older brother, Eric, was the leader, the creative one. I was just his puppet.</p><p>I was thinking that when I have children, that I should always dress as a character for them, so they think their mom is Alice in Wonderland or Cinderella. It would be totally messed up!</p><p>My mom and dad met at Anaheim High School. After they got married, all they wanted to do was have four children, and they did.</p><p>I wish I had an extra day with my mom sometimes. Or another hour in the day with my family, husband and children.</p><p>The golden child may be the oldest one, unless it&#39;s the youngest. It may be the toughest one, unless it&#39;s the most sensitive. It&#39;s not even necessary that Mom and Dad have the same favorite - and typically they don&#39;t.</p><p>In Hollywood, you play a mom, and the next thing you know, you&#39;re on &#39;The Golden Girls.&#39; They age you so fast.</p><p>In Hollywood, you play a mom and instantly, you&#39;ve got osteoporosis.</p><p>My mom is painfully sweet she&#39;s from Nebraska.</p><p>My mom was a diabetic. Her sister was a diabetic, so I was already a candidate.</p><p>When my dad divorced my mom it was kind of like him leaving me also.</p><p>After my mom died, there was so much written about her fashion and her style and all that, and I felt that one of the most important parts of her was missing, her real intellectual curiosity.</p><p>No matter how good you are, at some point your kids are gonna have to create their own independence and think that Mom and Dad aren&#39;t cool, just to establish themselves. That&#39;s what adolescence is about. They&#39;re gonna go through that no matter what.</p><p>I was always okay with the fact that I was taller and bigger than everybody else growing up. My mom, my dad, and my friends always told me I was beautiful.</p><p>When I turned 18, my mom, my nana and I all went and had tattoos of our favorite Bible verses put on the inside of our wrists. Mine is 1st Timothy, 4:12.</p><p>When I was 7, I came up with the idea of &#39;charm socks.&#39; My mom would take me to buy bags of plastic charms, we would sew them on frilly white socks, and I sold them at school.</p><p>My Mom always cooked healthy. Greek food lends itself to cooking healthy.</p><p>From the moment this baby came into our home, those two dogs have never been more in love. It&#39;s the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever witnessed. People keep saying, &#39;Oh, you&#39;re a single mom.&#39; I&#39;m like, &#39;Actually, I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve got two boys helping.&#39;</p><p>So far I&#39;m not surprised by anything about being a mom. It&#39;s all pretty great - but that&#39;s what I expected.</p><p>I was worried about my mom more than I was worried about the president. And then I was worried about the president, and then I was worried about myself.</p><p>Aretha Franklin was a teenage mom, a musician who came from an incredibly Christian background, but there was a lot of love, which is really inspiring in a feminist way.</p><p>When I moved out of my mom&#39;s house at 18 I was almost as sad to leave her sewing machine behind as anything else.</p><p>I was given baby doll toys myself, and they proved a stark reminder that my life was expected to revolve around childbearing - just as my mom&#39;s had before me, and her mom&#39;s had before her.</p><p>We all seek approval, and our mother&#39;s seal is usually the most important. The nitty gritty is that we have to accept ourselves, even if it is just to be ready for the next cut-down. Mom&#39;s blessing or not.</p><p>I was brought up by a single mom in a poor town in Arkansas and while some aspects of small-town life were really positive - like the fact that everyone there is really sweet and hospitable - there is also this close-minded mentality, and that naturally made me want to rebel.</p><p>My mother told me Homer Ditto was not my father. Nope. Mom had had a fling with some other guy who was my dad. Some dude who didn&#39;t stick around too long who Mom was happy to get rid of. She chose Homer, and Homer chose me, so he lent me his name even though I didn&#39;t have his blood.</p><p>If my Dad doesn&#39;t like you, you will know. My Mom is just too innocent to ever lie. She doesn&#39;t even cuss.</p><p>I have a chaperone everywhere I go - my mom.</p><p>Something my mom taught me when I was little is that everything happens for a reason.</p><p>There is nothing I love more than my role as a mom.</p><p>I look up to my mom. She&#39;s a beautiful woman.</p><p>My mom, she wasn&#39;t like a baseball mother who knew everything about the game. She just wanted me to be happy with what I was doing.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;ve lived quite a sheltered life, like my mom and dad were quite protective of me.</p><p>I bought a house for my mom, I bought a house for my dad, I bought a house for my sister.</p><p>There is nothing worse that a thirteen-year-old boy. You&#39;re embarrassed by your parents, and you&#39;re trying to find your independance because, deep inside, you are so dependent on your mom.</p><p>A friend of my mom&#39;s was a casting director so, really as kind of a lark, I had a couple of acting jobs that had just enough exposure to give me the option to continue if I wanted to. I followed through with it.</p><p>I&#39;m a religious person. I remember my mom told me: &#39;Vengeance belongs to God. It&#39;s up to him to wreak vengeance.&#39; It&#39;s hard for me to get to that point, but that&#39;s the work of God.</p><p>Sunscreen is my number 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 tip. I&#39;m a fanatic, partially because I live in L.A. and have fair skin and freckles, and partially because of my kids. My mom always made me wear sunscreen and I&#39;m trying to be that mom for them.</p><p>I&#39;ve actually suffered from allergies my entire life. My mom had allergies, so I was aware of what an issue they can be. Many people allow their allergies to affect their lives. As a mom with two kids and two jobs, I just can&#39;t let allergies slow me down. It&#39;s a day to day thing that can really be remedied by finding the right medication.</p><p>My mom was paranoid about my safety.</p><p>Mom was a smoker. My grandfather was a smoker. My aunts were smokers. My uncles were smokers. I don&#39;t know any smokers now, not even my mom.</p><p>My mom drives me crazy sometimes, but I have a good relationship with her.</p><p>My mom enlisted in the U.S. Navy in World War II, and my parents actually bought our home thanks to the loan she got through the GI Bill.</p><p>My dad is like a cactus - introverted and tough. I&#39;m a people person, like my mom, but I got my competitiveness from my dad. He came to this country from Belarus with nothing and built a real business. He&#39;s my hero for giving me that need to run a business and for having enormous confidence in me.</p><p>People who build family businesses are not classically trained. They have to deal with an enormous amount of politics. You think corporate politics are tough? Go work for your dad or your mom.</p><p>It&#39;s about getting the kids up and fed, getting one to school, getting the other down for a nap, going to the grocery store, picking one up from school, getting the other one down for another nap, cooking dinner... I live my life at these two extremes. I&#39;m either a full-time stay-at-home mom or a full-time actress.</p><p>I remember, my mom didn&#39;t have any help, so if she needed to be somewhere after school, we&#39;d just go down to the neighbors&#39; and she&#39;d give us a snack and make sure we did our homework. There weren&#39;t any latchkey kids.</p><p>My mom has always said that the one thing she wishes she had done differently is have a job. She felt like the single-mindedness made her a little nuts sometimes, and she could have used an outlet for herself when we were little.</p><p>My mom grew up in poverty in Oklahoma - like Dust Bowl, nine people in one room kind of place - and the way she got out of poverty was through education. My dad grew up without a dad, with very little and he also made his way out through education.</p><p>My mom was really vigorous about making sure that we saw things and that we questioned things. Education was so important to both of my parents.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to be a mom at 23, 24ish, ever since I was a little girl. I&#39;m right on schedule.</p><p>It&#39;s her first grandchild, so she&#39;s really, really, really excited. I guess my mom is a little more stressed out than me.</p><p>Mom would kill me if I showed my navel.</p><p>My hat was pulled down and this girl said &#39;Are you really him?&#39; I whispered &#39;Yeah, I&#39;m really him.&#39; She screamed, &#39;Mom! Dad! It&#39;s Heath Ledger!</p><p>In all honesty, at that time, I never saw myself as an author... I was just a Mom in a state of panic, trying to enter a short story contest to win the prize money in order to keep the lights on in my home.</p><p>When I was a kid I didn&#39;t feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably shouldn&#39;t say it, but, I didn&#39;t think anything was funny. So I used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my step-dad at the time and I didn&#39;t think anything was funny. I couldn&#39;t laugh.</p><p>I really want to adopt a child... I want to be called &#39;Mom.&#39; It really is the most beautiful word in the English language.</p><p>I wanted to be a 150% entrepreneur and a 150% mom, and I found that I was having a very hard time doing both. I was about 75% and 75% - still better than 100%, but not what I was accustomed to at work.</p><p>Every single thing I learned about marketing and building my business, I learned from my mom, and she had never been in the workforce. She just had great practical sense.</p>",2500)]))}const c=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,c as default};
