In discussing waste in education, I hope to draw attention to the isolation of the various parts of the school system, to the lack of unity of educational goals, to the lack of coherence of various subjects and methods.</p><p>---028---</p><p>The world is ruthless, including my own ruthlessness.</p><p>The world is cruel, including my own cruelty.</p><p>Dewey said: Man is part of the environment, and the environment is also part of man. Man does not think about the environment from outside the environment. When man is outside the environment, the environment becomes an object.</p><p>However, we cannot be outside of the environment; we can only be within it.</p><p>We are not spectators of the interaction of various forces in the world, but participants.</p><p>Isn&#39;t it a pleasure to learn and practice it from time to time?</p><p>---029---</p><p>Education is the fundamental method of social progress and social reform. Reforms that rely solely on the formulation of laws, or the threat of punishment, or on the change of mechanical or external arrangements are temporary and ineffective. Education is a regulatory role in the process of achieving shared social consciousness, and the adaptation of individual activities based on this social appreciation is the only reliable method of social transformation.</p><p>---030---</p><p>If we treat all the children in a class as the same without distinguishing their personalities, there will never be any education that is truly in line with scientific principles.</p><p>---031---</p><p>Education can not only develop children and young people, but also develop the future society. These children and young people are the molecules of this future society.</p><p>---032---</p><p>Personality is something developing and continually working out, not something all at once ready-made. It can be seen only in the history of life, in its continued growth; it is, as it were, a process, not something that can be observed only from one particular aspect of life. It is quite possible for teachers to make such a fuss about individual children, to worry so much about their peculiarities, their likes and dislikes, their weaknesses and faults, that they fail to perceive the real personality, and are indeed inclined to adopt methods which are obviously untrue to the individual&#39;s talents. The personality of a child cannot be seen in what he does at one moment, or what he consciously likes; it can only be seen in the continuous process of his actions.</p><p>---033---</p><p>Teachers are not simply engaged in training a person, but in the formation of a proper social life. Every teacher should realize the dignity of his profession; he is a public servant of society, dedicated to maintaining normal social order and seeking correct social growth. ?</p><p>---034---</p><p>Our social life is undergoing a thorough and radical change. If our education is to have any meaning for life, it must undergo a corresponding and complete transformation.</p><p>---035---</p><p>Why should a teacher study psychology, the history of education, the methods of teaching, and the like? There are two reasons: first, with this knowledge, he can observe and interpret the reactions of the child&#39;s mind--which would otherwise be easily overlooked. Second, by understanding the methods that others have used effectively, he can give the child proper guidance.</p><p>---036---</p><p>It is very important to emphasize the value of the early experiences of immature people.</p><p>---037---</p><p>To educate children based on the social function of things is essential for the development of morality and the growth of knowledge. The more closely and directly related children&#39;s learning is to social conditions, the more accurate and practical the knowledge they acquire will be.</p><p>---038---</p><p>我们能有意地利用教育，使青年从正路开始，由此排除显著的社会恶习，我们可以利用教育作为实现人类更好希望的工具。</p><p>---039---</p><p>If we are still teaching today&#39;s children the same way we did in the past, we are robbing them of their future.</p><p>---040---</p><p>Emotions can help and stimulate rationality, so that it does not become empty or inconsistent in knowing; rationality can guide emotions and strengthen emotions, so that it does not become blind or have a half-hearted effect.</p><p>---041---</p><p>To create a democratic society we need a system of education in which the process of moral and intellectual development is in practice as well as in theory a process of cooperative interaction of inquiry among free and independent men, who use the ideas and inheritance of the past as means and methods of further enriching their lives, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and who apply the good already achieved to discover and make better things.</p><p>---042---</p><p>Art as Experience</p><p>---043---</p><p>Education is a tool for the continuation of social life.</p><p>---044---</p><p>Without the cultivation of the scientific spirit, a man is deprived of the best tools designed for the effective guidance of human thought.</p><p>---045---</p><p>In schools, children often work together, so the reason for having such schools is that children must learn how to work with others. The reason is to allow individuals to develop fully and freely.</p><p>---046---</p><p>The transformation of society depends on the transformation of education.</p><p>---047---</p><p>There is only one way to test the success or failure of a new experiment in education, and that is to examine the children who have received the new education to see whether their lives are beneficial to society.</p><p>---048---</p><p>Education is an activity that includes science. It is in the process of education that more questions are raised for further research, which in turn are reflected in the process of education, further changing the process of education, thus requiring more ideas and more science, and the cycle repeats endlessly.</p><p>---049---</p><p>No matter what kind of career it is, such as business or politics, it cannot be separated from education. Without education, there will be no career.</p><p>---050---</p><p>The point is not to make the school an appendage of industry and commerce, but to make use of the elements of industry to make school life more lively, more relevant, and more closely connected with the experience outside the school. ... This transformation marks a society in which everyone should engage in a profession that makes the lives of others more valuable, and in which they can better recognize the ties that connect people and break down the barriers that separate them. This transformation means a state of affairs in which everyone&#39;s interest in his work is not forced but wise, that is, everyone&#39;s work is congenial to his own abilities and tendencies.</p><p>---051---</p><p>As modern industry becomes increasingly complex due to various scientific inventions, the worker who aspires to be truly successful must have a good foundation of general education on which to develop his specialized skills.</p><p>---052---</p><p>Through education, society can clearly express its own ends, organize its own methods and means, and thus shape itself clearly and effectively towards the desired goal of progress.</p><p>---053---</p><p>As long as school is connected with life, all subjects will inevitably be connected with each other.</p><p>---054---</p><p>It is the duty of every person interested in the cause of education to insist upon the school as the most fundamental and effective instrument of social progress and reform, in order to remind society of the ends for which the school strives, and to awaken it to the necessity of giving the educator adequate equipment for his work. Education thus conceived marks the most perfect and intimate union of science and art conceivable in human experience. The art of thus forming the powers of man and adapting them to the cause of society is the highest art; he who can perform it is the best artist; for such a cause no insight, no sympathy, no tact, no administrative ability would be superfluous.</p><p>---055---</p><p>This kind of vocational education does not make young people submit to the requirements and standards of the current system, but uses scientific and social factors to develop their courage and cultivate their practical and executive wisdom.</p><p>---056---</p><p>The social environment develops individual intellectual behavior and tendencies by engaging individuals in activities that arouse and reinforce various actions, which have certain purposes and bear certain consequences. ?</p><p>---057---</p><p>The social importance of many striking industrial processes has increased greatly, which inevitably makes the question of the relationship between school education and industrial life more important. The occurrence of such a large-scale social transformation cannot but challenge the education inherited from different social conditions and raise many new problems for education.</p>",120)]))}const f=t(a,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
