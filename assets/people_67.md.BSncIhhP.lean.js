passed by the legislature in 2003 which requires the opposition withhold a vote on committees on which the government does not have a majority in order to preserve the government majority premier benard lord argues he now has a majority again and the opposition should honour the terms of that motion while the opposition has said that they do not recognize a change of affiliation from a speaker in the chair and will still operate as if the government were in a minority situation until such time as the speaker resigns sits among the conservative caucus and reoffers for his office as a conservative through much of may the government and opposition began to negotiate to bring some order back to the legislature with only two parties represented the tight numbers make it difficult for the government to pass some of its agenda through the house and they had proposed radical rule changes to increase their majority inside of legislative committees the liberals opposed this saying it would turn the legislature into little more than a rubber stamp a counter proposal offered by the liberals was to see malley resign as speaker and in exchange the liberals would allow one of their members to stand for the post therefore increasing the working majority of the government by 2 votes in exchange for this the liberals wanted an early election in the fall of 2006 though the conservative government rejected this offer the liberals and conservatives began negotiations which included the possibility of removing malley from office on may 24 2006 government house leader bev harrison malleys predecessor as speaker said the government would not force malley from office but were he still speaker he would resign to resolve the deadlock malley has refused to comment to the media on this situation a vote on may 30 2006 to remove malley from office was defeated 27 to 25 later however fellow progressive conservative peter mesheau announced his plans to resign from the legislature and rather than face another minority bernard lord called an election malley sought reelection against bill fraser the man who led the protests against hospital cuts in malleys regionin the general provincial election of 18 september 2006 malley lost his seat to liberal challenger bill fraser malley was soundly defeated trailing his opponent by better than 20 percent in the popular

various lp covers he then stepped away from commercial work and devoted himself solely to free painting artistically he has developed in recent years away from the early role of the socalled star caricaturist to that of a star of the new pop realism his artistic visions are treasured and collected by other stars of the pop scene like the rolling stones who are friends of his and by art connoisseurs all over the worldin the quarter century of his creative career krger has remained true to the ideal of a new pop art dedicating his art to a kind of game of deception the interplay of identity and pose of authenticity and fiction this has enabled him to establish himself as a popular painter whose works draw large numbers of visitors to the galleries and museums the defining feature of his work is creative reflection about the apparatus of media presentation and the manic iconography of contemporary picture production his faces are a kindly meant but thoroughly subversive tribute to the world of beautiful appearances and to the rock and pop culture of the sixties with which the painter has cultivated an almost ritualistic relationship according to his own comment on his work everything is in transition thats all he has devoted himself for some years with the same artistic passion as before to the reworking of the private world of his childhoodthe artist lives and works near hanover and in californiahis primary medium is acrylic paint and his paintings are hyperrealistic in detail yet also extremely grotesque in their distortion the times praised him for

wwwperennialorguk perennial is one of the uks oldest charities which was created in 1839 helping horticulturists facing times of difficulty sir roger is also an accredited mediator roger singleton was universally seen as a balanced and liberal spokesman for childrens rights indeed the only significant public criticisms made of him as a professional for the bulk of his career prior to 2009 were accusations in 2003 that as chief executive of barnardos he had supported emotionally manipulative advertising campaigns used to raise the charitys profile in this case the uk advertising standards authority found decisively in singletons and barnardos favour singleton has been chairing the isa since 2007 the isa was set up to deliver its responsibilities under the safeguarding vulnerable groups act 2006 and as part of the vetting and barring scheme vbs it makes barring decisions on those people referred to it usually from employers following harm or the risk of harm to a child or vulnerable adult it has the legal powers to place or remove people from both of its barred lists for children and adults in march 2009 the government appointed singleton chief adviser on the safety of children where his responsibilities included advising the government on strategic priorities and reporting annually to parliament on safeguarding progress he stood down from the role in june 2010in autumn 2009 anger erupted in the press against the vbs which singleton chairs and which was at the time due to require a phased introduction of all people working or volunteering with children and vulnerable adults to become isaregistered the most vociferous articles opposing the vbs in 2009 were in the daily telegraph although these were then expanded upon by the today bbc radio 4 programme singleton responded to these by pointing out that many of the parliamentarians who were criticising the scheme had actually voted for it in his role as chief advisor sir roger was asked by ed balls the then childrens minister to undertake a check on the governments definition of regulated activity the guidance which would define whether someone needed to be registered under the scheme his recommendations were published in december 2009 drawing the line and were accepted by the government his proposals were projected to reduce the number of people due to be isaregistered by approximately 2million in 2010 the coalition government initially announced a delay to registration and then undertook a review of the vbs which proposed a series of amendments to the scheme including the abolition of the need to register the proposals are currently going through parliament in the protection of freedoms bill to which singleton was asked to give evidence following what have been seen as widely welcomed changes the independent safeguarding authority continues to exist although it has been amalgamated with the criminal records bureau the isa retains the role of maintaining a list of people barred from working with children and vulnerable adults singletons continued defence of the restructured isa continues to draw criticism as the isa is still perceived by many as being authoritarian and structured in an unethical way with high profile journalists such as josie appleton continuing to protest against it via the manifesto club which she chairs 2 this has been seen by some as having damaged his credibility severely this was particularly demonstrated by successful legal cases taken by the royal college of nursing against the isa in 2010 the royal college of nursing alongside other organizations continues to campaign for the isa to include a hearing within the isa barring process for the isa to have minimal standards of evidence and to have flexible sanctions indeed that the isa should use the word sanction when describing the barring process the isa under singletons leadership continues to resist these changes3 to this extent he has become probably the most public figure representing a perceived authoritarian conservative stance within britains current child protection debatesir roger was awarded an honorary degree lld from the university of bath in

is known for his research on processing fluency especially the processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure he developed together with norbert schwarz from the university of michigan and piotr winkielman from the university of california at san diego the core assumption of the theory is that an audience draws aesthetic pleasure from the fact that an object can be processed easily especially if a viewer remains unaware of the source of this processing ease this theory resolves an apparent contradiction between the uniformity of musical preferences in infants and the cultural differences of musical tastes in adults infants prefer consonant melodies because newborns share biological mechanisms that make them process consonance in music more easily than dissonance when children grow up they are exposed to the music of their culture explaining why individuals from different cultures have different musical tastes in addition research found that processing fluency influences both affect and the judged truth of statements suggesting that ease of processing is a common underlying experience in both perceived beauty and judged truth this observation fits anecdotal observations that mathematicians and scientists sometimes use beauty of a theorem as an indication for its truth an idea that has been explored in more recent work processing fluency and its effects can help explain the ahaexperience the processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure has influenced work in psychology philosophy marketing and finance an extension of the processing fluency theory takes account of the fact that many artworks are difficult to process nevertheless audiences interpret these artworks in a meaningful way and like themmore recently rolf reber and his collaborators have developed and explored example choice an instructional technique designed to increase relevance and student interest in the learning of abstract principles in mathematics and science students are given examples from different topics that all address the same underlying principle and a student has to choose the example that interests him or her most the chosen example is then used to explain the formal principle this technique is supposed to connect the formal principle to students interest research has shown that students become more interested and spend more time learning the principle when they can choose an example than when they are given an examplerolf reber is author of two popular science books in german among them kleine psychologie des alltglichen a brief psychology of
