web browser cookies to track consumers across different web sites allowing marketers to better match advertisements with consumers the patent was bought by doubleclick and then doubleclick was bought by googlein 2003 robinson published an article in linux journal which discussed mathematical approaches for fighting spam which led to work along with tim peters on the spambayes project which began in 2002 the spambayes approach was notable because it assigned scores to both spam and ham useful emails and used an algorithm to guess intelligently whether an incoming email was spam the scoring system enabled the program to return a value of unsure if both the spam and ham scores were high his mathematical approaches were also used in projects such as spamassassin spamassassin combined a bayesian statistical approach using a textclassifier rulebased approach to whittle down spam spamming is the abuse of electronic messaging systems to send unsolicited undesired bulk messages according to david anderson who quoted robinsons approaches in 2006 robinson commented in linux journal on how fighting spam was a collaborative effortthe approach described here truly has been a distributed effort in the best opensource tradition paul graham an author of books on lisp suggested an approach to filtering spam in his online article a plan for spam i took his approach for generating probabilities associated with words altered it slightly and proposed a bayesian calculation for dealing with words that hadnt appeared very often an approach based on the chisquare distribution for combining the individual word probabilities into a combined probability actually a pair of probabilitiessee below representing an email finally tim peters of the spambayes project proposed a way of generating a particularly useful spamminess indicator based on the combined probabilities all along the way the work was guided by ongoing testing of embodiments written in python by tim peters for spambayes and in c by greg louis of the bogofilter project the testing was done by a number of people involved with those projects gary robinson 2003in 1996 robinson patented a method to help marketers focus their online advertisements to consumers he explainedas far as i have been able to tell its the very first patent to mention using web browser cookies to track consumers across different web sites and build a profile of their interests in order to determine what ads to show them there was an aspect in the way browser cookies were implemented that allowed them to be used i hired programmers to do the programming to actually test it the hypothesis turned out to be correctin 2010 robinson was the chief technology officer at flyfi an online music service owned by mainebased emergent discovery which uses his antispam programming techniques along with collaborative filtering technologies to help make music recommendations to web users his blog gary robinsons rants has been quoted by others in the computer and online music industries and cited by academic papers robinson helped develop recommendation engine technology which applies highpower mathematical techniques using software algorithms to have a computer guess intelligently about what a consumer might like for example if a consumer likes music by artists such as the beach boys bob dylan and the talking heads the computer software will match these preferences with a much larger dataset of other consumers who also like those three artists but which cumulatively has much greater musical knowledge than the single consumer accordingly the computer will find music that the user might like but hasnt been exposed to and therefore hopefully offer intelligent recommendations but the mathematics behind such comparisons can become quite complex and involved robinson studied mathematics at bard college and graduated in 1979 and studied further at the courant institute of new york university in the 1980s robinson worked on an entrepreneurial startup dating service called 212romance which used similar computer algorithms to match singles romantically the new york citybased voice

city in 1943 is an experimental filmmaker and film editor who has been making films since 1963 he has resided in san francisco since 1971the major part of my work is both silent and paced to be projected at silent speed 18 frames per second silence in cinema is undoubtedly an acquired taste but the delicacy and intimacy it reveals has many rich rewardsin film there are two ways of including human beings one is depicting them another is to create a film form which in itself has all the qualities of being human tenderness observation fear curiosity the sense of stepping into the world sudden murky disruptions and undercurrents expansion pulling back contraction relaxation sublime revelation in my work the screen is transformed into a speaking character and the images function as pure energy rather than acting as secondary symbol or as a source for information or storytelling i put shots together to create a revelation of wisdom through delicate surprise the montage does not lead to verbal understanding but is actual and present the narrative is that which takes place between the viewer and the screen silence allows these delicate articulations of vision which are simultaneously poetic and sculptural to be fully experienced nathaniel dorskythe films of nathaniel dorsky blend a beauteous celebration of the sensual world with a deep sense of introspection and solitude they are occasions for reflection and meditation on light landscape time and the motions of consciousness their luminous photography emphasizes the elemental frisson between solidity and luminosity between spirit and matter while his uniquely developed montage permits a fluid and flowing experience of time dorskys films reveal the mystery behind everyday existence providing intimations of eternity steve polta san francisco cinemathequeaccording to critic and historian richard suchenski in dorskys films objects are decontextualized and sometimes unmoored from their surroundings allowing connections to develop which resonate not only between shots but also across the films as a whole encouraging more active forms of awarenessin his book devotional cinema 2003 dorsky writes of the longstanding link between art and health as well as the transformative potential of watching film he also writes of the limitations of film when its vision is subservient to a theme or representative of language description which can describe a world but does not actually see itdorsky was a visiting instructor at princeton university in 2008 and he has been the recipient of

aboriginal art movementthe people of yuendumu in the early 1980s began transferring their traditional ochre ground paintings to canvas and then to the doors in 1983 stewart along with four other artist painted thirty of the yuendumu schooldoors with dreaming designs negotiating the content with other warlpiri men and women who also collectively owned the designs twentyseven dreamings tjukurrpa were represented on the doors referring to more than two hundred sites in warlpiri and anmatyerre territorythe painted doors were also intended to remind the yuendumu schoolchildren of a web of sites and obligations extending across their country the doors remained at yuendumu resisting erasure for twelve years despite the desert wind and sun and robust treatment from warlpiri schoolchildrenthe entire series of yuendumu doors was acquired by the south australian museum in 1995 and then restored twelve of the best doors were selected for a traveling exhibition that toured australia for three years the yuendumu doors are now at the south australian museumin 1985 the warlukurlangu artists committee was established in yuendumu and the cooperative held its first major exhibition that year the cooperative holds a unique place in contemporary aboriginal art collectively the works have a highly characteristic style and colour palette that sets them apart from all other desert painting one of the distinctive features of the work is that the iconography ordered as stories dreamings or jukurrpa remain detailed and strongly definedin other desert communities the art has become increasingly simplified and minimal but at yuendumu the works are rich with the symbols that convey the law and mythology of the people one of the reasons is that ritual design kurruwarri forms the basis of the work and the rules that govern its expression are strictly adhered to at yuendumuthe law and culture being depicted in the paintings therefore remains strong and true to its source the name warlukurlangu comes from an important local dreaming meaning place of firetrue to its name warlukurlangu has become known for its vibrant palette which in recent years has encompassed an extraordinary range of colours from hot fuchsia mauve and electric blue to marigold yellow and tangerine orangethere is a stylistic similarity between many of the artists works but there are also artists whose work is highly individual such as judy napangardi watson jack jakamarra ross polly napangardi watson clarise nampijinpa poulson paddy japaljarri sims and paddy japaljarri

recorded his testimony in his own language in 1991 he evokes the continuity of dreaming from grandfather and father to son and grandson down the generations and across the passages of time yet the insistence on the obligation to preserve and transmit his three jukurrpass attest to the corrosive possibility of secular change he goes on to aver that the maintenance of dreaming has to be really strict so that his family will not lose it like paper or throw it away or give it away to other familiesmy fathers grandfather taught me first and after a while my father taught me the same way as his father told jukurrpa dreaming and then my father is telling the same story about what his father told him and now he is teaching me to live the same kind of jukurrpa and follow the way what my grandfather did and then teach what my father did and then im going to teach my grandchildren the same way as my father taught mewhen my father was alive this is what he taught me he taught me the traditional ways like the traditional designs in body or head of kangaroo dreaming thats what we call marlu dreaming and eagle dreaming he taught me to sing song for the big ceremonies people who are related to us in a close family they have to have the same sort of jukurrpa dreaming and to sing songs in the same way that we do our actions like dancing and painting on our bodies or shields or things and this is what my father taught me my dreaming is the kangaroo dreaming the eagle dreaming and the budgerigar dreaming so i have three kinds of dreaming in my jukurrpa and i have to hang onto it this is what my father taught me and this is what i have to teach my sons the same way my father taught me and thats way it will go on from grandparent to sons and follow that jukurrpa noone knows

following question during training at vandenberg air force base in late 1973how can i know that an order i receive to launch my missiles came from a sane presidentthe single integrated operational plan specifies that when the national command authority issues an order to use nuclear weapons the order will filter down the chain of command per the siop decisionmaking is the responsibility of the nca not of officers lower in the chain of command who are responsible for executing on nca decisions to ensure no opportunity for execution by a rogue operator the twoman rule requires that at each stage two operators independently verify and agree that the order is valid in the case of the minuteman missile this is done by comparing the authorization code in the launch order against the code in the sealed authenticator a special sealed envelope which holds the code if both operators agree that the code matches the launch must be executed journalist ron rosenbaum claimed herings question exposed a flaw in the very foundation of this doctrinewhat if the presidents mind is deranged disordered even damagingly intoxicated can he launch despite displaying symptoms of imbalance is there anything to stop himrosenbaum says that the answer is that launch would indeed be possible to this day the nuclear failsafe protocols for executing commands are entirely concerned with the presidents identity not his sanity hering was pulled from training and unable to receive a reply to his satisfaction requested reassignment to different duties instead the air force issued an administrative discharge for failure to demonstrate acceptable qualities of leadership hering appealed the discharge and at the air force board of inquiry the air force stated that knowing whether or not a launch order is lawful is beyond the executing officers need to know hering repliedi have to say i feel i do have a need to know because i am a human being it is inherent in an officers commission that he has to do what is right in terms of the needs of the nation despite any orders to the contrary you really dont know at the time of key turning whether you are complying with your oath of officethe

commissioner of the new state department of intellectual disabilitiesas a young man henry attended hiwassee college and the university of tennessee and served with distinction in the vietnam war subsequent to his military service henry became active in veterans issues and in the american legion and veterans of foreign wars he also became politically active first serving as a city councilman in kingston tennessee in 1971 at the age of 26henry remained on the kingston council for two years and then served as mayor of that city until 1978 he also became active in republican circles although the mayoralty of kingston is a technically nonpartisan office rising relatively rapidly to be chairman of the tennessee republican partyin 1980 henry was elected to the tennessee house of representatives from the 32nd district in traditionallyrepublican roane county of which kingston is the county seat in his first term he served as chair of the republican caucus and upon his reelection in 1982 was made minority leader in which position he served three twoyear terms during this time henry rode back and forth to sessions of the tennessee general assembly in nashville with two famously partisan democrats state senator anna belle clement obrien and state representative tommy burnett and has stated that he learned from the experience that the vast majority of issues facing tennessee are not particularly of a partisan nature or amenable to purely partisan solutionsin 1989 henry was appointed to the powerful fiscal review committee but in 1990 was narrowly defeated for a seventh term in the house by dennis ferguson who still represents the 32nd district as of 2006 a combination of factors including a well known republican john smith running as an independent and low voter turnout led to henrys narrow defeat afterward henry began to devote the majority of his efforts to his business working with the developmentally disabled one of his own children suffers from a developmental disability and reaching out to children affected by drug abusein 2001 henry was approached by state republican leaders identified largely with the sundquist administration and the partys moderate wing with the intention of encouraging him to run for governor the next year henry agreed despite facing long odds due to the partys increasing conservatism and the relative popularity of fourth district us representative van hilleary who had far superior namerecognition in part due to the unusual configuration of his congressional district which at the time stretched from virginia to mississippi henry made every effort to run a statewide race but was swamped in the august 2002 primary by hilleary by a margin of about two to one carrying only roane and one adjacent county while hilleary carried the other 93 hilleary took henrys challenge very seriously too seriously according to hilleary critics spending much money which others felt needed to be saved to use against bredesen in the general election and needlessly alienating henrys supporters several of whom subsequently supported bredesen or remained neutral causing hillearys margin in east tennessee to be less than that traditionally needed by republicans to have a chance in statewide elections and helping lead to his defeat by bredesen by a fairly narrow marginin 2005 henry was again approached by some republican leaders to run for governor especially when it began to appear likely that no prominent republican would challenge for the nomination to oppose bredesen and that the nomination could go to a relative political unknown or perennial candidate however henry quickly refused to mount a second gubernatorial run at the time some republicans fears regarding the election were later allayed by the candidacy of state senator jim bryson henry has promised to remain a loyal republican supporter but has stated that he sees it as being in the best interest of his family at this time to avoid campaigning for elected office at the presentjim henry is no relation to 1990 tennessee republican gubernatorial nominee dwight henry but is sometimes confused with him as both have been republican candidates for

concert hall the performer is the entire congregation where everyone sings or where some sing while others pray the congregation is also an instrument the music resounds through the faith of the universal church as an sacrifice to the holy trinity the goal is the congregations prayer rather than aesthetic pleasure the essential point is that the music hears us and interprets us before the throne of god not that we hear the music this is the fundamental assumption on which my work is based i would liken my work to that of the painter of icons where each icon is a window to a reality
