graduate students on what we call symmetrical predicates such as equal equal near and meet for which it is the case that if a is x of b where x is the predicate it is also true that b is x of a some years ago amos tversky and his collaborators suggested that the symmetry of similar is by no means perfect since sentences such as south korea is similar to china seemed somehow better and more acceptable than china is similar to south korea on the basis of such findings they concluded that similarity is not a symmetrical concept our own work however shows that these imperfect symmetries hold for other symmetrical predicates too thus sam meets the pope is more acceptable than the pope meets sam the bicycle is near the garage is more acceptable than the garage is near the bicycle and so on from this we conclude that the asymmetry is not in the concepts near similar etc but in the subjectpredicate relationship thats in the syntax i hope to do further studies to study what if any semantic relationship underlies the arguments that force these asymmetries that is in what way is south korea to china as sam is to the pope and the bicycle is to the garage"},{"author":"Gregory

city which presents both chamber and orchestra concerts kotik has received numerous commissions and composition grants from the national endowment for the arts among others and in 1996 he received the prestigious composition award from foundation for contemporary arts he is also known for his realization of the complete musical works of marcel duchampwith the sem ensemble which he founded in 1970 kotik has for many years actively promoted the work of other mostly american composers sharing a stylistic affinity with his own work giving frequent performances as conductor and performer with the group as well as its larger version the orchestra of the sem ensemblekotiks music is composed in the minimal vein with works often being of long duration and featuring slow tempi and quiet dynamics though his works feature innumerable gradual slight changes giving them a seemingly static quality his harmonies however are more complex than those employed by many other american minimal composers and his musical process is not as apparent to the listener as for example in the works of steve reich or philip glass further kotik does not draw as heavily on jazz or rock in his works as do many of his american colleagues though like steve reich he is quite interested in medieval music and often integrates medieval compositional techniques into his works these qualities set kotiks music apart from american minimal trends giving his music a decidedly european character more similar in outlook to for example that of hungarian minimalists such as zoltn jeney lszl sry or lszl vidovszkyamong kotiks best known works is the sixhour opera many many women 197678 based on a text by gertrude stein for whose work appropriately kotik has a special affinityas a performer kotik has been an active chamber musician throughout much of his life until 1992 kotik did not have the slightest interest in orchestra that changed in 1992 when he conducted atlas eclipticalis by john cage with the 86piece orchestra of the sem ensemble in tribute to john cage at carnegie hall with david tudor as the soloist since then kotik has been organizing largescale events expanding the sem ensemble into the orchestra of the sem ensemble and encouraging and commissioning other composers to write for orchestra in 1999 after conducting gruppen by karlheinz stockhausen kotik initiated a project of compositions for 3 orchestras and commissioned the creation of new 3orchestra works by alvin lucier christian wolff martin smolka phill niblock and olga neuwirth in 2001 kotik founded the biennial ostrava days an institute and festival of new music in ostrava czech republic this threeweek program one of the largest in existence focuses on works for orchestra with 2 resident orchestras and number of resident composers chamber music groups and soloistsalthough kotik entered the conservatory at the age of 14 he only began composing in his late teens this was due to his lack of interest in classical harmony a tendency shared with other composers such as christian wolff and john cage as a composer kotik is essentially selftaught in spite of his education in western composition fundamentals in prague and vienna his technique has very little to do with commonly used compositional methods kotiks compositional system can be compared to a game in which the use of controlled chance is balanced by conscious decisionmaking the two alternate one influencing the other in this way kotik triggers unpredictable processes while the work progresses in the envisioned direction in recent years kotik has relied increasingly on intuitive gestures the strategies and limitations kotik imposes on chance along with intuitive decisions are at the root of his compositional processamong kotiks bestknown compositions are music for 3 1964 for piano and 2 strings spontano 1964 for piano and ensemble composed for frederic rzewski kontrabandt 1967 a live electronic work commissioned by the wdr electronic music studio many many women 197578 on a text by gertrude stein and letters to olga 198891 on a text by vclav havel his orchestra pieces include quiescent form 199496 the

that students will neither give nor receive assistance with class work unless permitted by the instructor 22during the winter quarter of his freshman year at stanford plaintiff enrolled in computer science 106a as part of his course work he was required to complete programming assignments named yahtzee eudorette and afterdark toward the end of the quarter plaintiffs computer science instructor erik chen notified the stanford office of judicial affairs of approximately six cases involving sixteen students who had potentially violated the stanford honor code one of the cases involved plaintiff and a white student student a based on similarities in their yahtzee and eudorette assignments a second case involved plaintiff an asian student student b and an hispanic student based on similarities in their afterdark assignmentsnancy morrison was the judicial officer and assistant dean of students at stanford at the time of chens complaint as the judicial officer she was responsible for investigating instructor chens charges of honor code violations and deciding if formal charges should be made against a student according to morrison of the 16 students named by chen who is asian eight are asian and four of those have indian surnames six are caucasian one is hispanic and one is middle easternchen provided morrison with the results of a moss measure of software similarity analysis of the assignments moss is a system for determining copying in computer programming assignments the moss analysis showed a high degree of similarity between plaintiffs and student as yahtzee and eudorette submissions and a similarly high degree of similarity between plaintiffs and student bs afterdark submissions chen subsequently advised morrison that plaintiffs and the hispanic students afterdark submissions were not sufficiently similar to warrant honor code chargesmorrison met personally with plaintiff on march 23 2001 plaintiff stated that his assignments were available on stanfords computer network without password protection and that he was concerned that student a and student b may have accessed his work from the network without his knowledgemorrison met again with plaintiff on april 4 2001 at this meeting plaintiff initially stated that he wrote his code himself and that someone must have seen his code he later 33 stated in the meeting that he and student a had worked together on the yahtzee and eudorette assignments and that the code had been copied between plaintiff and student a he also advised that he had been stuck on the afterdark assignment and that student b had showed plaintiff the students code and plaintiff had copied the code from a hard copy of student bs codein an email two days later plaintiff again explained that he had become stuck on the afterdark assignment he approached student b and asked him how he had completed his function in order to help me he showed me a paper copy of his releasestream functionmorrison met with plaintiff and student a together on april 16 2001 during the meeting plaintiff repeatedly asked student a to admit that the two of them had worked together on the yahtzee and eudorette assignments student a repeatedly and consistently denied working with plaintiff student a presented morrison with an analysis that showed that the style in which he wrote code was consistent throughout all his assignments in the course whereas except for the yahtzee and eudorette assignments plaintiffs work did not include such styleon april 24 2001 morrison met with plaintiff and his parents plaintiff stated that he believed the honor code policy was unclear as to whether students could work together on codestudent b denied showing plaintiff any part of his afterdark assignment including the releasestream function his denial was corroborated by stanford computer security records that demonstrated that student b had not yet printed a copy of his assignment at the time plaintiff claimed student b showed him a hard copy student b also explained his thought process for approaching the assignment and identified similarities between plaintiffs and the students work product that went beyond the releasestream function that plaintiff had admitted reviewingas a result of her investigation morrison charged plaintiff with honor code violations for copying student a on the eudorette and yahtzee assignments and student b on the afterdark assignment she based her decision on plaintiffs changing and inconsistent 44 statements his admission that he collaborated on assignments the consistent and unequivocal denials of student a and student b the information she received from all parties the instructor and stanford computer security as well as the fact that plaintiff was implicated in multiple incidentsmorrison made the decision not to charge student a on april 17 2001 two months before charging plaintiff and one day after meeting together with plaintiff and student a she decided not to

denied the appealprocedural historyplaintiff originally brought a civil complaint for damages against stanford and two of its employees in state court plaintiff challenged his discipline on the ground

has externed for the california supreme court after two motions to dismiss what remains is plaintiffs claim pursuant 42 usc section 1981b that during the disciplinary proceeding defendants discriminated against plaintiff on account of his racenational origin he does not challenge 55 the outcome of those hearings rather he contends that he was treated in a racially discriminatory manner during the processthe court directed defendants to file their summary judgment motion by december 2 2005 and scheduled the hearing for february 3 2006 the court scheduled the hearing for two months after defendants filed their summary judgment motion to give plaintiff the opportunity to request additional discovery after plaintiff had reviewed defendants motion at plaintiffs request the court twice continued the motion and the deadline for plaintiffs opposition to give him even more time to conduct discovery to defeat defendants motion as the final deadline for plaintiffs opposition

affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law anderson v liberty lobby inc 477 us 242 24849 1986discussiona legal standardplaintiff contends that defendants charged him with cheating because of his national originrace the parties agree that the legal framework for evaluating plaintiffs claim is that established by mcdonnell douglas corp v green 411 us 792802 1973 this familiar test is usually applied in the employment context and requires a plaintiff to first establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination by showing 1 he belongs to a protected class 2 he was qualified for the position 3 he suffered an adverse employment action and 4 some other circumstance indicates a discriminatory motive such as similarly situated individuals being treated more favorablysee godwin v hunt wesson inc 150 f3d 1217 1220 9th cir 1998 the test however should be adapted to the facts of each case see ruggles v cal polytechnic state univ 797 f2d 782 785 9th cir 1986to meet his prima facie burden plaintiff must show 1 he belongs to a protected class 2 he suffered some adverse action and 3 some other circumstance indicates a discriminatory motive such as similarly situated individuals being treated more favorably defendants argue that plaintiff must also show that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with cheating the court is not so certain as defendants and plaintiff acknowledge plaintiff cannot challenge the judicial panels finding that he copied student a and student b see defendants appendix of exhibits exh q plaintiffs opposition to defendants motion to dismiss stating that he does not challenge the judicial panels decision as the court has previously ruled such a contention is barred by res judicata as plaintiff filed and lost a state court lawsuit challenging the finding and his suspension the claim here is different he contends that both he and student a did what defendants claim constituted 77 cheating yet defendants charged him and not student a with cheating because of plaintiffs racenational origin accordingly for the purposes of the parties motions for summary judgment the court will not require plaintiff to prove the evidence was insufficient to charge him with cheatingwhen and if plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination the burden shifts to defendants to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse actionreeves v sanderson plumbing prods 530 us 133 142 2000 if defendants meet this burden of production then the burdenshifting framework disappears and the only remaining issue is discrimination vel non id at 143 although the burden of production shifts the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiffid internal quotation marks and citation omitted and in attempting to satisfy this burden the plaintiff once the defendant produces sufficient evidence to support a nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision must be afforded the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons but were a pretext for discrimination id citation omittedb nondecisionmakersas a preliminary matter summary judgment must be granted in favor of individual defendants beeson nyberg and weiss there is no evidence that any of these defendants were involved in the decision to charge plaintiff with cheating the sole issue is whether morrison and thus stanford intentionally discriminated against plaintiffc prima facie showingit is undisputed that plaintiff is a member of a protected class and that he suffered some adverse action namely being charged with and suspended for cheating the dispositive issue is whether he has submitted evidence sufficient to show that the reason he was charged was discriminatory that is because of his racenational origin the requisite degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on summary 88 judgment is minimal and does not even rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence aragon v republic silver state disposal 292 f3d 654 659 9th cir 2002plaintiff has not satisfied even this minimal showing he first attempts to show discrimination by arguing that he and student a were similarly situated to raise an inference of discrimination the allegedly similarly situated person must be similarly situated in all material respects not in all respectsmcguinness v lincoln hall 263 f3d 49 53 2d cir 2001 the ultimate question that is informed by the similarly situated analysis is whether there is a basis for inferring discriminatory motive does the purported purpose of the challenged action require similar treatment of the two employees or does it justify different treatment due to differences in their status or situation rather than race or ethnicity bowden v potter 308 fsupp2d 1108 1117 nd cal 2004plaintiff and student a shared several similarities both were freshmen in the same computer science course with the same assignments and they lived next to each other in the stanford residence halls plaintiffs instructor initially prepared an analysis for the stanford office of judicial affairs that described six potential honor code violations involving 16 students next to plaintiffs and student as names as well as the names of three other students the instructor typed the word definite for the other names he typed potential or questionable chens analysis did not determine if the students had worked together or if one had copied the other without the others knowledge if morrison had decided to charge plaintiff and not student a based solely on this information plaintiff would have satisfied his prima facie burden because he and student a would have been similarly situated in all material respects see mcguinness 263 f3d at 53the decision to charge plaintiff however was not made at that time instead it was made after morrison conducted an investigation after that investigation plaintiff and student a were not similarly situated in material respectsfirst plaintiff unlike student a gave inconsistent explanations for the similarities between his work and student as work plaintiff initially told morrison that he had created his own code and that the other students must have copied his work he even explained that 99 his work was available on the stanford network without password protection he later contradicted his earlier statement by explaining that he and student a had worked together on two assignments and that with student bs permission he had reviewed a hard copy of some code on which student b had been working student a and student b in contrast each consistently denied working with plaintiff and never changed their storiessecond plaintiffs story was contradicted by documentary evidence stanford computer security records demonstrated that plaintiffs claim that he had reviewed a hard copy of a portion of student bs code was false student b further contradicted plaintiffs story by identifying other similarities between plaintiffs work and student bs work which are not explained by plaintiffs story student a also provided morrison with an analysis which showed that his work on the copied assignments was consistent with his style on all his other assignments in which there was no allegation of copying plaintiffs other work in contrast did not contain these unique characteristicsthird morrison was provided with stanford computer security records that indicate plaintiff had attempted to access the computer home folders of student a student b as well as other students in the computer science 106a classfourth plaintiff was implicated in three assignments involving two different students student a with two assignments student b with a different assignment whereas student a and student b were only implicated with plaintiff this evidence suggested that plaintiff was the person responsible for the copyingin short the evidence that plaintiff had cheated was much stronger than the evidence as to student a indeed the evidence suggested that plaintiff had copied student as work without his permission but there was no evidence that the converse had occurred that is that student a copied plaintiff without plaintiffs permission moreover morrison upon chens recommendation also eventually declined to charge student b with cheating the evidence with respect to this student was similar it suggested that plaintiff copied student b without his permission but not the converse in such circumstances no reasonable jury could find that student a was similarly situated to plaintiff see coward v cambridge school 1010committee 171 f3d 12 21 1st cir 1999 no valid comparison can be drawn between two incidents for the purpose of proving disparate treatment if differentiating or mitigating circumstances distinguish the students conduct or the schools responseplaintiff unsuccessfully attempts to dispute some of the above differences he claims that he did not make the statements morrison attests he made as evidence he cites paragraph 4 of his affidavit plaintiffs opposition at p 89 paragraph 4 merely states the white student student a and i worked together to complete assignments in cs 106a at the time we collaborated neither of us felt that such collaboration was in violation of any university policy including the honor code this testimony does not contradict morrisons affidavit indeed it is silent as to what plaintiff told morrison moreover plaintiffs testimony as to what student a felt is inadmissiblehe also contends that student a made similarly inconsistent statements his evidence that student a made such statements however consists solely of student as deposition testimony that he told morrison he had discussed the computer programming assignment with other students in the class plaintiffs motion for summary judgment at 15 such testimony does not contradict morrisons testimony that student a consistently denied collaborating with plaintiff even when plaintiff in front of morrison implored student a to admit to such collaboration in sum there is no admissible evidence that student a made inconsistent statements or statements similar to plaintiffsplaintiff also emphasizes that morrisons june 29 2001 letter charging him with honor code violations admits the possibility that student a and student b may have collaborated with plaintiff and thus violated the honor code themselves such statement however is not evidence that the evidence against student a and student b was as strong and compelling as the evidence against plaintiff that morrison had already finally decided not to charge student a and so notified him before june 29 also does not give rise to an inference of discrimination again the evidence against student a was slim at best compared to the evidence implicating plaintiff moreover morrison testified that the 1111 language used in the letter was standard and that in the letter she did not want to preclude any defense that plaintiff might raiseplaintiff makes no attempt to dispute the evidence that contradicts his story as to why he and student bs afterdark assignments were so similar for example he does not offer any evidence that disputes the evidence that stanford computer security records show that student b could not have printed out and provided plaintiff with a hard copy as plaintiff had explained nor does he respond to the point that his story about reviewing a hard copy of the students releasestream function does not explain the other similarities in their codeplaintiff also does not produce any evidence to dispute morrisons testimony that student a provided morrison with an analysis that showed that the specific stylistic characteristics for how student a wrote code were consistent for each of his assignments in the course and not consistent for plaintiffs assignments except for the two assignments the judicial panel found plaintiff had copied plaintiff contends that instructor chen did not perform such an analysis but that contention does not dispute morrisons testimony that student a showed her such an analysis indeed her testimony is corroborated by an email attached to plaintiffs motion plaintiffs exh p to motion for summary judgment again morrison was not faced with such damning evidence against student a instead student a consistently denied working with plaintiff and maintained that plaintiff must have copied him an allegation that was supported by the evidence presented to morrisonfinally plaintiff also does not dispute that morrison had evidence that plaintiff had attempted to open the computer files of student a student b as well as other students in his computer science classnext plaintiff contends that even if the decision to charge him was not discriminatory morrisons investigation itself was discriminatory he asserts that morrison sought out a statement from student as computer science teaching assistant but did not similarly seek such a statement for plaintiff until after he was formally charged as plaintiffs evidence demonstrates however student a provided morrison with the statement from his teaching assistant on his own there is no evidence that morrison asked for the statement there is 1212 also no evidence that morrison prevented plaintiff from providing her with such evidence should he have taken the initiative to do so moreover prior to plaintiffs hearing morrison did obtain a statement from plaintiffs teaching assistant notwithstanding the statement the judicial panel found that plaintiff had copied students a and bplaintiff also complains that morrison obtained student as final score for the class but not plaintiffs score which according to the record was a not passing grade again there is no evidence that morrison sought out student as final grade moreover there is no evidence she considered the grade in deciding not to charge him with cheatingplaintiffs other arguments are similarly meritless and do not require discussion his claim that discriminatory intent is evidenced by morrisons use of her nickname nanc on one of her emails to student a and on none of the emails to plaintiff is typical of these other argumentsc burden shifting and pretexteven assuming plaintiff had satisfied his minimal prima facie burden defendants have produced evidence that provides a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for charging plaintiff with cheating as is explained above see bodett v coxcom inc 366 f3d 736 744 9th cir 2004 in deciding whether a defendant has met its burden of production under mcdonnell douglas the court must take its evidence supporting its reason for the adverse action as trueas defendants have met their burden of production any presumption of evidence that arises from the prima facie showing disappears the question is on the record before the court could a reasonable jury find that plaintiffs racenational origin likely motivated defendants decision to charge plaintiff with cheating the answer is no there is no evidence that plaintiffs racenational origin played any role whatsoever rather plaintiff was charged because morrison believed the evidence supported a finding that plaintiff had copied student a and student b the judicial panel agreed in other words no reasonable jury could find that morrison did not honestly believe that plaintiff had copied student a and student b see bodett 366 f3d at 744 1313this conclusion is supported by the undisputed evidence that defendants did not charge student b who was asian with cheating and that of the six students in plaintiffs computer class she did charge with cheating two are caucasian moreover two of the students morrison decided not to charge are asian with indian surnamesplaintiff contends that at a meeting before morrison charged plaintiff morrison handed plaintiff a document prepared by an employee of student as fathers company and stated that plaintiff should take special note that the document was written by someone indian plaintiffs decl at 15 morrison denies that she made the statement but for summary judgment purposes the court must accept plaintiffs sworn testimony nonetheless this evidence does not save plaintiffs claim while the statement suggests that morrison was aware of plaintiffs ethnicity it does not suggest that she charged him with cheating because of his raceethnicity especially in light of the evidence discussed aboveplaintiffs contention that defendant beeson made a reference to his being indian is also unavailing again the statement is disputed but the court must accept plaintiffs sworn testimony as true the statement however was made more than eight months after morrison charged plaintiff with cheating and it was made by a person who was not involved in the decision to charge plaintiff the statement is thus insufficient to support a finding that plaintiffs raceethnicity was likely a motivating factor in morrisons decision to charge plaintiff 1414conclusionon the record before the court viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff no reasonable jury could find that defendants more likely than not charged plaintiff with cheating because of his racenational origin nor could they find that defendants treated him a certain way during their investigation because of his racenational origin accordingly defendants motion for summary judgment is granted and plaintiffs crossmotion for summary judgment is deniedit is so ordered"},{"author":"Wieki Somers","quote":"wieki somers sprangcapelle 1976 is a dutch designer she

phd in the laboratory of alistair brown at the institute of genetics at the university of glasgow he defended his phd thesis in 1989 on transcription mechanisms in yeast he then moved to basel switzerland to further study yeast molecular biology there he became interested in the possibilities of studying aging in simple laboratory animals this prompted a move to the university of colorado institute for behavioral genetics and to the laboratory of thomas e johnson who was studying the first genetic mutation to slow aging in a gene he called age1after making a series of discoveries linking aging to stress lithgow established his own independent laboratory at the university of manchester england which investigated the relationship between stress and aging he moved the lab in 2001 to the newly established buck institute for research on agingthroughout his career lithgow was a prominent spokesperson for aging research and frequently interacting with print radio and television media he has appeared on the today program on radio 4 and has given interviews to numerous national newspapers including the new york times and the guardian about aging and his research and has presented to scienceloving lay audiences he gave an extended interview about aging science to the science networklithgow sheds light on the mechanisms of aging by identifying agents that extend lifespan or prevent agerelated disease he has discovered a range of factors that can lengthen life in the microscopic worm caenorhabditis elegans and he applies these findings to studies in human cells in culture much evidence points to stress contributing to a breakdown in the ability to maintain optimal molecular stability resulting in aging and disease certain lifeextending agents help c elegans respond to lifelong stress by remodeling the natural stress fighting cellular mechanisms the lithgow lab has found for example longlived mutants of c elegans can are very stress resistant as a result of elevated levels of heat shock proteins heat shock proteins promote longevity probably by preventing a loss of protein balance longlived mutant strains are also resistant to heavy metals so the lithgow lab went on to study the relationship between longevity and metallostasis the lithgow lab has discovered that certain cell proteins capable of extending life can also be closely involved in disease prevention but when proteins play such dual roles they may sometimes make tradeoffs that affect the fate of the organism lithgow is studying genetic variations in checkpoint proteins that may create a tradeoff between the rate of aging and incidence of cancerthe lithgow lab has made seminal discoveries in the use of pharmacological agents to intervene in aging processes such as antioxidants that protect cells against damage from unstable chemicals called free radicals more recently his lab have uncovered compounds that act as stress response mimetics that maintain protein balance and stability these compounds suppress pathology associated with alzheimers disease the lab continues to undertake screens for chemical compounds that slow aging and extend healthspanhe is the
