great talent for selfpromotion quickly becoming one of the most popular and the most recognisable intellectuals in yugoslavia often the ideas he floated at that time were nothing more than publicity stunts including campaigning for president of yugoslaviain 1990 after the first democratic elections franjo tuman took him seriously and made him his chief political advisor during negotiations which tuman pursued with the leader of the serbs in croatia jovan rakovi letica secretly recorded tapes of some of the conversations subsequently he leaked these tapes to the croatian media hoping that some of rakovis remarks would give offense to his fellow croatian serbs and turn them away from rakovis secessionist policies the effort spectacularly backfired and contributed to the escalation of conflict into war that and other gaffes finally prompted tuman to sack letica in early 1991 as he left letica publicly stated that he would have served as a political advisor to slobodan miloevi if compensatedin the following years letica continued to appear in the croatian media as a commentator and became a regular columnist for globus a popular news magazine during his time at globus he

dolomites where he repeated many famous routes often climbing them solo and free and put up many new routes of the hardest difficulty for which he was nicknamed the spider of the dolomites he became an alpine guide in 1952 his notable solos include the solleder route on the civetta the soldaconforto route on the marmolada and the southwest ridge of the matterhorn in winterin 1959 maestri together with cesarino fava and austrian guide toni egger travelled to patagonia to attempt the northeast ridge of the unclimbed cerro torre the three climbed up a steep corner below the col of conquest between cerro torre and torre egger then fava turned back and maestri and egger headed for the summit six days later fava found maestri lying face down and almost buried in the snow they returned to base camp and claimed that maestri and egger had reached the summit but egger had been swept to his death by an avalanche as they were descendingover time many climbers have started doubting maestris 1959 account as it became evident how difficult even by todays standards the alleged route is among the doubters are many wellknown alpinists like carlo mauri who had failed to climb the mountain in 1958 reinhold messner and ermanno salvaterra who used to defend maestri until having attempted the route himself the criticism was also taken up by british climber and writer ken wilson editor of mountain magazine apart from the sheer hardness of the climb the critics point out that maestris description of his route is detailed and accurate up to the high point where cesarino fava turned back but vague and impossible to trace on the mountain thereafter and that bolts pitons fixed ropes and other equipment abandoned by the 1959 expedition is plentiful up to the col but absent thereafter nevertheless maestri has consistently maintained his version of events as did fava who died in april 2008in 1970 maestri returned to cerro torre and climbed a new route on the southeast side of the mountain over two seasons maestri used a petroldriven compressor weighing approximately 300 pounds and thousands of feet of fixed ropes to drill bolts into the rock some 400 in all the resulting route became known as the compressor route the routes namesake can still be found hanging on the face of cerro torre 100 meters below the summit on this second endeavour maestri stopped short of the summits ice mushroom almost always covering the highest pointthe compressor route was immediately controversial hand bolting of short unprotectable sections of rock has long been an accepted practice in mountaineering however the use of a compressor the excessive number of bolts and their placement near naturally protectable features was considered to be far from reasonable mountain magazine ran a story titled cerro torre a mountain desecrated and the bolting of cerro torre prompted reinhold messner to write the essay the murder of the impossible on january 16 2012 the climbers hayden kennedy and jason kruk made the first fairmeans ascent of the southeast ridge of cerro torre on their descent kennedy and kruk chopped about 120 bolts from the compressor route effectively removing it from the mountain days later on january 21 2012 the climber david lama made the first free ascent of the southeast ridgewerner herzog made the film scream of stone in 1991 a dramatised version of the

which he was a pioneer along with john sulstonbiographyrobert waterston was born in 1943 in detroit michigan he went to princeton as an undergraduate where he majored in engineering while spending as much time as possible studying the humanities he wrote his senior dissertation on the plays of eugene oneill by this time he was thinking of switching to medicine but had never studied biologywhile on what we might now call a gap year visit to germany he took courses in biology in german and returned to take up a place at the school of medicine of the university of chicagoby 1972 he had acquired both md and phd degrees and a taste for research i was more interested in advancing medicine than going into practice he says a chance meeting with sydney brenner on a physiology summer school at the woods hole marine biological laboratory in 1969 had introduced him to the grand project then beginning at the mrcs laboratory of molecular biology lmb in cambridge england to understand life at the molecular level through studying the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans at the earliest possible opportunity waterston left for cambridge to become the third american postdoctoral researcher to join brenners group to work on the wormbrenner was looking for worms with mutations that affected their behavior as part of the search for genes controlling the nervous system and muscles waterston took on the task of looking at the cellular and molecular level for abnormalities in the muscle mutants and within a few years had made discoveries that led to the cloning of genes for two important muscle proteinshe returned to the usa in 1976 as an assistant professor of anatomy and neurobiology at washington university in st louis and set up a lab dedicated to studying the molecular biology of muscle in the worm there he and his colleagues identified many more muscle genes and investigated their role in muscle assembly and contraction as well as discovering and analyzing transposable elements and nonsense suppressors a few years later he switched to the department of genetics where by 1991 he became chairin the mid1980s he made a sabbatical visit to the lmb ostensibly to continue his work with brenner but the only space available was in the room where john sulston and alan coulson were beginning to map the worm genome waterston joined them and after his return to st louis the worm map became a collaborative project between the two labsin 1989 one of the first human genome project grants went to waterston and sulston to begin the sequencing of the worm genome they were so successful that at the same time that the wellcome trust established the sanger centre with sulston at its head waterston received funding from the national human genome research institute to undertake largescale human sequencing at his washington university lab the partnership became the first to complete the sequence of a multicellular organism when the worm genome was published in december 1998 and both labs played key roles in the sequencing of the human genome with waterstons lab contributing more of the finished sequence than any other us lab the partnership went on have leading roles in the sequencing of both the mouse and chimpanzee genomes waterston like his colleague john sulston has always been committed to the free release of scientific information and he was an influential voice in establishing the bermuda principles on data sharing in 1996 in the past few years waterston and sulston have jointly won numerous awards for their scientific work and their support for the scientific community including the gairdner award the general motors prize the dan david prize and the george w beadle medal of the genetics society of america waterston also received the gruber prize in geneticsin january 2003 waterston moved from st louis to become the new william gates iii endowed chair in biomedical science professor and chair of the department of genome sciences at the university of washington in seattle he is leading research into the genetic control of development in the nematode he has developed novel technology to decipher automatically the dynamic expression of genes with single cell resolution and minute time resolution and applied the technology to describe the expression patterns of more than 200 transcription factors as part of the nhgri modencode project with collaborators he has collected data that accurately defines the complement of both protein coding and many noncoding genes of the nematode in another modencode project he and collaborators are defining the binding sites for those transcription factors they are now combining these sets of data to construct increasingly complete regulatory networks directing c elegans embryonic development recently he has used next generation sequencing methods to develop a collection of mutant c elegans strains containing more than million mutations to probe the function of the more than 20000 c elegans genes collaborations both inside and outside of the university have helped the genome sciences department bolster an exciting teamwork atmosphere it has formed close ties with the school of medicine to study human variation more effectively the faculty also partner with clinicians interested in applying genomic technologies to medical problems in addition the department has established a strong outreach program by bringing leadingedge science and ethics teachers to k12 classes the department helps address the unique social and ethical challenges implied in the new discoveries in genome sciences today the uw department of genome sciences is carrying on its legacy of collaboration it is a world pioneer of genome interpretation and technology innovation

known for his derivation in 1976 of the stochastic simulation algorithm ssa also called the gillespie algorithm the ssa is a procedure for numerically simulating the time evolution of the molecular populations in a chemically reacting system in a way that takes account of the fact that molecules react in whole numbers and in an essentially random way since the late 1990s the ssa has been widely used to simulate chemical reactions inside living cells where the small molecular counts of some reactant species often invalidate the differential equations of traditional deterministic chemical kineticsgillespies original derivation of the ssa began by considering how chemical reactions actually occur in a wellstirred dilute gas reasoning from physics and not by heuristically extrapolating deterministic reaction rates to a stochastic context he showed that the probability that a specific reaction will occur in the next very small time dt could be written as an explicit function of the current species populations multiplied by dt from that result he deduced using only the laws of probability an exact formula for the joint probability density function pj of the time to the next reaction event and the index j of that reaction the ssa consists of first generating random values for and j according to pj and then actualizing the next reaction accordingly the generating step of the ssa can be accomplished using any of several different methods and gillespies original paper presented two the direct method which follows from a straightforward application of the well known monte carlo inversion method for generating random numbers and the firstreaction method which is less straightforward but mathematically equivalent later workers derived additional methods for generating random numbers according to gillespies function pj which offer computational advantages in various specific situations gillespies original derivation of the ssa applied only to wellstirred dilute gas systems it was widely assumedhoped that the ssa would also apply when the reactant molecules are solute molecules in a wellstirred dilute solution with many smaller solvent molecules in fact it does but that was not definitively established until 2009 the extent to which the ssa is valid under other typical cellular conditions such as when the reactant molecules crowd each other or when they move by active transport mechanisms along physically confined pathways remains to be seenthe ssa is one component of stochastic chemical kinetics a field that gillespie played a major role in developing and clarifying through his later publications his broader research has produced articles on cloud physics random variable theory brownian motion markov process theory electrical noise

poor prospects for employment in the field of chemistry he went to work for busicom a business calculator manufacturer there he learned about software and digital logic design when busicom decided to use largescale integration circuits in their calculator products they approached the american companies mostek and intel for manufacturing help the job was given to intel who back then was more of a memory company and had facilities to manufacture the high density silicon gate mos chip busicom requiredfollowing marcian ted hoffs initial conception formulated in 1969 shima later helped design the 4004 processor working at the intel offices for six months from april until october 1970 with federico faggin the project leader his company then sold the rights to use the 4004 to intel with the exception of use in business calculatorsintel then designed the 8008 architecture by computer terminal corporation design by federico faggin and hal feeney shima was then employed to implement the transistorlevel logic of intels next microprocessor which became the intel 8080 conception and architecture by federico faggin he was not involved in creation of 8088 and 8086 shima moved to zilog in 1975 and using only a small number of assistants developed the transistorlevel and physical implementation of the z80 under the supervision of faggin who conceived and designed the z80 architecture to be instruction set compatible with the intel 8080 this was followed by the same task for the 16bit z8000according to coworkers from intel faggins method that shima used was to design all logic at the transistor level directly and manually not at the gate andor register level the schematics were therefore hard to read but as transistors were drawn in such a way that they suggested a floorplan of the chip it actually helped when making the physical chip layout however according to shima himself the logic was first tested on breadboards using ttl chips before being manually translated into mos transistor equivalents"},{"author":"Patricio Hern%C3%A1ndez","quote":"patricio hernndez born 16 august 1956 is an argentine football soccer coach and former playerhernndez started his career in 1974

12 points to only 2 points three years later she defeated bennett on her second attempt due to national preferences she became the first nonlabor mla for gladstone in 63 years and only the third in 80 yearscunninghams victory was especially significant in the light of the extremely close result of the 1995 state election it initially appeared as if the result would be a hung parliament with cunningham holding the balance of power although later counting delivered a oneseat majority to the goss labor government the situation nevertheless gave her significant influence as she forced the retention of incumbent speaker jim fouras for the new parliament over the partys desired replacement her inaugural speech on september 1995 reaffirmed her combined focus on community issues and social policy criticising the goss governments transport and health policies and advocating the reintroduction of corporal punishment a return to institutionalisation of the mentally ill and a return to christian valuescunninghams influence in the assembly increased dramatically in december 1995 when the court of disputed returns ordered a byelection in the seat of mundingburra which the labor government had held by 16 votes in the general election after a disastrous byelection campaign which included the disendorsement of incumbent mla ken davies liberal candidate frank tanti won costing the government its majority and leaving cunningham in a position to effectively choose the next premier of queensland cunningham announced that she would support the coalition on matters of confidence and supply in the legislative assembly citing their having won the popular vote in the general election rather than face certain defeat in the legislature goss resigned paving the way for borbidge to succeed him she declined an offer from the new government to become speaker insisting that it would compromise her ability to represent her electoratethroughout her first term cunningham generally supported the coalition government with her support borbidge was able to fend off numerous noconfidence motions and pass most of his major legislative proposals when the alp moved against the government over the carruthers and connollyryan inquiries cunningham helped block a noconfidence motion in the government and although she moved a motion against attorneygeneral denver beanland insisted that she did not demand his resignation this resulted in criticism from some quarters that she was effectively another national party mpshe nevertheless insisted that the government consult with her on most legislation including budgets and she was also able to exercise significant power this was made clear in 1996 when she watered down the governments workplace compensation reforms despite strong government resistance so as to retain access to the common law for injured workers and workers compensation for travel to and from work among other things as a generally conservative mp cunningham became known for her opposition to abortion and her support of capital punishment in 1996 she was the only member of the parliament to oppose new gun control reforms in the aftermath of the port arthur massacre which otherwise received bipartisan support the following year cunningham was responsible for an amendment which successfully defined the term life in the states criminal code assault provisions as beginning at conceptioncunningham increased her primary vote at the 1998 state election but her political influence severely declined when peter beattie formed an alp government with the support of newly elected independent peter wellington taking a similar line to the state national party cunningham noted in the leadup to the election that she would be willing to work with any members of the farright one nation party if they were elected she held her seat with an increased majority at the 2001 election and actually won enough votes to clinch reelection without the need for preferencesin april 2002 cunningham was stopped by police while driving and asked to undergo a breath test she refused on the grounds of suffering asthma and was subsequently charged after receiving little sympathy from premier beattie she was fined and had her driving license suspended her third term was also marked by an attempt to ban flagburning which failed after the government blocked her private members bill on the grounds that it violated free speech her call for a commission of inquiry into child sexual abuse in foster care also failed due to opposition from the government she received her highest primary vote yet at the 2004 election again with enough votes to win without going to preferencescunningham was nominated for speaker after the election with the support of the opposition nationalliberal coalition the one nation party and the states six independents but was soundly defeated by government nominee ray hollis she raised allegations of bullying against the management of the gladstone hospital in 2005 going to rockhampton to testify before the forster review of the states health systemcunningham was a strong favourite to retain her seat at the 2006 state election which she held coming into the election by a margin of 112 points however after a strong local labor campaign focusing on cunninghams perceived support for controversial federal industrial relations laws she came close to defeat with her eventual victory over labor candidate chris trevor being one of the last results declared of the election during the next parliament she voted against the cloning of embryos for stem cell researchcunningham once again retained her seat in the 2009 state election despite a 4point swing to labor and she was easily reelected at the

intersubjectivity and secondary intersubjectivity which endow the infants developing mindbrain with the architecture necessary for the achievement of symbolic thoughthobson throws further light on this basic claim by examining what occurs in cases where for genetic or environmental reasons infants are denied the opportunity to investigate intersubjective relationships to achieve a rare vantage

numbers of orphans rescued from nicolae ceauescus romanian orphanages were available the obstacles each of these circumstances placed in the way of normal infantcaregiver interaction are finely examinedhobsons argument constitutes a challenge to certain flavors of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology in that it traces the conception of the human mind back to a cradle of social
