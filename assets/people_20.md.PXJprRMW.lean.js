about philosophy religion and science in late medieval and early modern europe he studies magic and related beliefs and practices astrology demonology divination kabbalah as parts of normative philosophy and science as they were a few centuries ago his research shows that magic and other occult beliefs and practices were supported primarily by the philosophy and science of aristotle and aristotelian scholasticism which dominated european culture from the thirteenth through the seventeenth centuries when confidence in aristotelianism collapsed in the seventeenth century magic and its attendant beliefs collapsed with it as serious issues for europes leading thinkerscopenhaver also studies the ancient greek and latin hermetica writings from late antiquity ascribed by renaissance scholars to an ancient egyptian god thoth whose greek name is hermes trismegistus although this legendary hermes has often been identified as a divine patron of magic copenhaver has shown that the greek hermetic texts recovered in the fifteenth century by marsilio ficino are not about magic their topic is a religious practice aiming at personal salvationcopenhavers work on giovanni pico della mirandola and lorenzo valla both famed as renaissance humanists goes in two very different directions pico as the inventor of christian kabbalah valla as the scourge of scholastic logic copenhaver shows that picos famous oration on the dignity of man is not about the dignity of man pico did not give it that title instead the speech is a manifesto for ascetic mysticism urging the pious to abandon the body and escape the material world through magic and kabbalah like pico valla was a master of the latin language and an acute student of philosophy unlike pico valla had little influence on his time and place through the work that copenhaver has studied the dialectical disputations whose main target is peter of spains summary of logic written in the thirteenth century but still europes leading textbook of logic when valla wrote his disputations although vallas contemporaries paid little attention to it his disputations foreshadows what we now call philosophy of languageboth valla and pico lived during a great era of italian intellectual life starting with dante petrarch and boccaccio in the fourteenth century and ending with giordano bruno tommaso campanella and galileo in the seventeenth century in the nineteenth century italian philosophers worked out the grand narrative of italian thought in this earlier period the renaissance and afterward the construction of this story as an artifact of modern italian politics especially the risorgimento and the fascist regime is another topic that copenhaver has exploredcopenhaver was educated at loyola college baltimore

myself in soviet labour camps amongst german prisoners of war polish underground army members some of vlasovs men and banderas men where the crime of katyn was frequently and hotly discussed i developed quite when i know not a deeper interest in the subject and with the passage of time and influenced by material i had gathered i began to see that the version of the katyn crime given in 1943 by polish exile groups in london had no real foundationduring my sevenyear stay in the camps i met many german officers who in 1941 were occupying the territories of smolensk and saw with their own eyes camps with polish officers i also met in the camps several residents of smolensk whose statements finally confirmed my conviction that some polish exile groups in london sanacja took advantage of the discovery by germans of the mass graves of polish officers in order to use it as a political weapon against general sikorski whose policy towards the soviet union as indeed his very person was to
