la finitude 2006 introduces an entirely new option into modern philosophy different from immanuel kants three alternatives of criticism skepticism and dogmatism the book was translated into english by philosopher ray brassier meillassoux is associated with the speculative realism movementin this book meillassoux argues that postkantian philosophy is dominated by what he calls correlationism the often unstated theory that humans cannot exist without the world nor the world without humans in meillassouxs view this is a dishonest maneuver that allows philosophy to sidestep the problem of how to describe the world as it really is prior to all human access he terms this prehuman reality the ancestral realm in keeping with the mathematical interests of his mentor alain badiou meillassoux claims that mathematics is what reaches the primary qualities of things as opposed to their secondary qualities as manifested in perceptionmeillassoux tries to show that the agnostic scepticism of those who doubt the reality of cause and effect must be transformed into a radical certainty that there is no such thing as causal necessity at all this leads meillassoux to proclaim that it is absolutely necessary that the laws of nature be contingent the world is a kind of hyperchaos in which the principle of sufficient reason is abandoned even while the principle of noncontradiction must be retainedfor these reasons meillassoux rejects kants socalled copernican revolution in philosophy since kant makes the world dependent on the conditions by which humans observe it meillassoux accuses kant of a ptolemaic counterrevolutionseveral of meillassouxs articles have appeared in english via the british philosophical journal collapse helping to spark interest in his work in the anglophone

in 1956 at melbourne he won a bronze medal in the 5000 metres after the games ibbotson focused on the mile which was probably an error ibbotson began the 1957 season running in mile races as a 5000m or 3 mile runner would often do in the early part of the racing season to race at a faster pace than he would need in those longer distances after he had run a particularly fast mile at a glasgow meeting an experienced athletics official told the bbc that while it was a very good time he and many others felt that ibbotsons greater potential was over 5000m or 3 milesin a race dubbed mile of the century ibbotson won probably because delaney the 1500m champion at melbourne the previous year was boxed in at a crucial point on the final lap the time was a new world record taking 08 of a second off john landys time of 358 min set in 1954 ibbotson continued competing in mile races throughout the season as well as some longer distance events and ended the season exhausted it was not just the number of races but the faster pace at which they were runibbotson never found the same form again ibbotson represented england in the empire games at cardiff in 1958 andwas beaten by herb elliott
