left college and enlisted in the us navy wayne trained through propeller driven aircraft up into the grumman f9f cougar and f11 tiger carrier based fighters in 1963 when faced with the choice of either transitioning into the f4 phantom or taking an aerial application job back at home wayne chose to be with his family and started flying agricultural operations in fixed wing aircraft and rotorcraft wayne began flying aerobatics after taking ownership of a pitts s1c in the early 80s entering his first international aerobatic club contest in 1983 1today with over 27000 hours of flight time logged wayne is a highly respected record setting aviator who received the california agricultural aircraft associations outstanding airman award in 1985 the international aerobatic club named

airshow circuit wayne initially flew a pitts special biplane in an act that he called agrobatics in which he merged some of the techniques that an agricultural pilot might employ while applying chemicals to crops with his own graceful style of aerobatic flying wayne would fly under a ribbon stretched between two poles which simulated powerlines afterwards he performed an inverted cut of that ribbon using his propeller after a few years in the pitts wayne started work on a one of a kind aircraft which would be known as the raven the raven is a composite monoplane with a unique paint scheme that paid tribute to the bird species which has been observed performing aerobatics apparently for fun originally based on the rebel 2300 homebuilt aircraft wayne modified the design with a two place seating arrangement the edge wing by zivko aeronautics and many other custom details such that the raven was a one of a kind aircraft of waynes design very advanced for its time the raven was capable of 16g over 380 degrees per second roll rate a 4000foot 1200 m per minute rate of climb stunning tumbles torque rolls tailslides and any other maneuver wayne could create this aircraft performed for airshow crowds for over a decade up until its august 2005 retirement to the evergreen aviation museum where it will hang above the spruce goose in 1998 with sponsorship by oracle and seeking an even more impressive airshow aircraft wayne set out to create the exceptional oracle turbo raven which was the worlds only aerobatic aircraft with a thrust to weight ratio higher than one more thrust than weight teaming up with richard giles of akrotech and agair systems the oracle turbo raven came to life the composite airframe based on the g202 design had an empty weight of only 1600 pounds 725 kg and was fitted with a 750 horsepower 560 kw pratt whitney pt6a25c turboprop that generated 2800 pounds 12500 n of thrust which gave the aircraft a power loading of less than 27 lbhp at ready to fly weights with this unheard of power loading the oracle turbo raven could fly straight up hover in midair back up stop and then accelerate straight up out of the hover the aircraft also had enough power that it could recover from flat spins simply by flying out of them with the nose still on the horizon with a top speed of 300 mph 480 kmh and a roll rate of 450 degrees per second this aircraft was quite impressivewayne once again got into the record books flying the turbo raven from brake release to 3000 meters in only one minute and nine seconds on january 20 1999 in july 1999 at eaa airventure oshkosh the turbo raven took three minutes six seconds to get to 6000 meters and established the turbo raven as the fastest climbing propeller driven aircraft in the world this aircraft was also able to reverse the pitch of its propeller blades in flight and could actually slow down while diving towards the ground wayne used this ability to make very steep approaches to land as well as for unique maneuvers where he could slow below stall speed while diving sadly this aircraft was destroyed october 3 1999 exactly one year to the day after its debut when the engine failed during one such approach at the california international airshow at salinas and wayne was unable to accelerate above stall speed with the propeller in reverse pitch wayne was seriously injured though fortunately he made a full recovery and was flying within a month after the accident the ntsb official accident investigation claims that the powerplant and the propeller were operating normally and blamed the crash on pilot error 2today wayne continues to train coach and evaluate aerobatic students and airshow pilots from the ground and in flight in his extra 300l as well as give safety seminars on spins

art in particularfiguration libre is often regarded as having roots in fauvism and expressionism and is linked to contemporary movements such as bad painting and neoexpressionism it draws on pop cultural influences such as graffiti cartoons and rock music in an attempt to produce a more varied direct and honest reflection of contemporary society often satirizing or critiquing its excessescombas own work has always been strongly rooted in depictions of the human figure the figures are often in wild violent or orgiastic settings usually on large often unstretched canvases combas crowds his flat pictorial space with a teeming proliferation of bodies street poetry and designs reminiscent of the compulsive patterning in much folk and outsider art he creates hectic narratives of war crime sex celebration and transgressionin short every phase that makes up the constant flux of modern life in recent years a strong autobiographical strain has been evident in his work which was present only on a subliminal level if at all in the earlier workcombas often seems to be offering the work as critiqueof both the art establishment and society at large the recent painting i am greedy man features a densely layered jostle of bodies with the foreground dominated by transparent line figures the background occupied by monochromatic figures and the middle ground reserved for two more fully realized figures one in a business suit and the other muscular and shirtless they dance in a swirl of text which seems to have no discernible beginning or end but which may be read as i am

cellular particles of unknown function found in nearly all eukaryotes cells containing a nucleus cryoelectron microscopy combined with single particle reconstruction has provided overall dimensions of the vault at 42 x 75 nanometers a nanometer is a millionth of a meter these measurements indicate that the vault is larger in mass and size than many viruses the overall structure of the intact vault is like a hollow barrel with two protruding caps and an indented waist with a very thin shell surrounding an internal cavity large enough to encompass several hundred proteins thus the vault particle is a nanocapsule with incredible potential for compound encapsulation protection and delivery using a wellcharacterized insect virus into which a cloned gene can be easily inserted it is possible to produce large quantities of a given protein in cultured insect cellsthe rome lab has collaborated with a number of groups to use this system to produce large quantities of the major vault protein mvp the protein is able to selfassemble into vaultlike particles these mvponly vaults are somewhat irregular often containing distorted caps however lab members have demonstrated that coproduction of all three vault proteins mvp tep1 and vparp in insect cells results in selfassembly of particles that appear identical to naturally occurring vaults by using molecular genetic techniques to modify the gene encoding the major vault protein vault proteins have been produced with chemically active peptides attached to their sequence these modified proteins are incorporated into the inside of the vault particle without altering its basic structure the rome lab proposes to produce modified vault particles in order to test the concept that vaults can be bioengineered to allow their use in a wide variety of biological applications including drug delivery biological sensors enzyme delivery controlled release and eventually as parts for nanoelectrical machines"},{"author":"Laura

win over students disinclined to take history seriously no one was therefore surprised when he won a teaching prize in 1986 and was named the duke university scholarteacher of the year his prose style written and spoken was admired by critics for its clarity its elegance and its dry humorsteinmetz was an intellectual historian and a specialist in the history of christian thought in late medieval and early modern europe his earliest works explored the reception of the teaching of st augustine in the later middle ages determining if possible the intellectual influence such late medieval augustinianism might have exercised on martin lutherluthers early thought was often articulated in biblical commentaries and lectures this fact led steinmetz to take a fresh look at the history of biblical interpretation typically historians were satisfied if they tried to analyze luthers hermeneutical theory rather than his exegesis but steinmetz was dissatisfied with what he regarded as an exclusive interest in hermeneutics and concluded that such an approach while useful was woefully inadequatewhat historians needed was something more than a critical review of interpretive theory what they needed was a wholesale immersion of their minds in the exegesis itself steinmetz argued that exegesis could not be understood properly in isolation from its own larger context unless historians developed a comparative approach to their texts reading as many commentaries as possible on each biblical passage they would never understand what biblical exegesis could tell them about the intellectual world they were studyingsteinmetz shifted the focus of his studies from luthers early theology to the theology and exegesis of luthers younger contemporary john calvin using as many as 60 early modern commentaries on pauls letter to the romans steinmetz looked at calvins theological development through the lens of medieval and early modern interpretations of paul by placing calvins exegesis in its proper context he could now tell calvins ordinary comments broadly shared by his contemporaries from his original insightsthe late heiko oberman characterized steinmetzs study of calvin as an exquisite contribution to calvin scholarship that succeeds in tracing the precise profile of calvin as biblical interpreter barbara pitkin called his calvin scholarship a collection of pathbreaking studies that set investigation into calvins biblical interpretation on a new footing2in 1996 steinmetz was honored by his students with a festschrift biblical interpretation in the era of the reformation and in 2006 was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 2008 he and his wife endowed the annual steinmetz lectures in historical theology shortly thereafter
