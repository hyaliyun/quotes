For the world was built to develop character, and we must learn that the setbacks and grieves which we endure help us in our marching onward.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young.&quot;</p><p>Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.</p><p>Even a mistake may turn out to be the one thing necessary to a worthwhile achievement.</p><p>Most people spend more time and energy going around problems than in trying to solve them.</p><p>&quot;I believe God is managing affairs and that He doesn&#39;t need any advice from me. With God in charge, I believe everything will work out for the best in the end. So what is there to worry about.&quot;</p><p>You can&#39;t build a reputation on what you are going to do.</p><p>&quot;One of the greatest discoveries a man makes, one of his great surprises, is to find he can do what he was afraid he couldn&#39;t do.&quot;</p><p>Capital punishment is as fundamentally wrong as a cure for crime as charity is wrong as a cure for poverty.</p><p>&quot;The man who will use his skill and constructive imagination to see how much he can give for a dollar, instead of how little he can give for a dollar, is bound to succeed.&quot;</p><p>It is not the employer who pays the wages. Employers only handle the money. It is the customer who pays the wages.</p><p>Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.</p><p>&quot;Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.&quot;</p><p>A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.</p><p>As we advance in life we learn the limits of our abilities.</p><p>History is more or less bunk.</p><p>&quot;There is one rule for the industrialist and that is: Make the best quality of goods possible at the lowest cost possible, paying the highest wages possible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person&#39;s point of view and see things from that person&#39;s angle as well as from your own.&quot;</p><p>A business absolutely devoted to service will have only one worry about profits. They will be embarrassingly large.</p><p>An idealist is a person who helps other people to be prosperous.</p><p>Money is like an arm or leg - use it or lose it.</p><p>There is no man living that can not do more than he thinks he can.</p><p>Time and money spent in helping men to do more for themselves is far better than mere giving.</p><p>&quot;Speculation is only a word covering the making of money out of the manipulation of prices, instead of supplying goods and services.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wealth, like happiness, is never attained when sought after directly. It comes as a by-product of providing a useful service.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Enthusiasm is the yeast that makes your hopes shine to the stars. Enthusiasm is the sparkle in your eyes, the swing in your gait. The grip of your hand, the irresistible surge of will and energy to execute your ideas.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The only real security that a man can have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience and ability.&quot;</p><p>There is joy in work. There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something.</p><p>&quot;Competition is the keen cutting edge of business, always shaving away at costs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exercise is bunk. If you are healthy, you don&#39;t need it: if you are sick you should not take it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If money is your hope for independence you will never have it. The only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability.&quot;</p><p>Any colour - so long as it&#39;s black.</p><p>&quot;The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time.&quot;</p><p>A bore is a person who opens his mouth and puts his feats in it.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s right about America is that although we have a mess of problems, we have great capacity - intellect and resources - to do some thing about them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A market is never saturated with a good product, but it is very quickly saturated with a bad one.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Before everything else, getting ready is the secret of success.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are no big problems, there are just a lot of little problems.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whether you believe you can do a thing or not, you are right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The highest use of capital is not to make more money, but to make money do more for the betterment of life.&quot;</p><p>You can&#39;t learn in school what the world is going to do next year.</p><p>Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.</p><p>It has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste.</p><p>&quot;You will find men who want to be carried on the shoulders of others, who think that the world owes them a living. They don&#39;t seem to see that we must all lift together and pull together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Business is never so healthy as when, like a chicken, it must do a certain amount of scratching around for what it gets.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whatever you have, you must either use or lose.&quot;</p><p>I do not believe a man can ever leave his business.
