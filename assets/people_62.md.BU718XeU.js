the past 50 years ahead of various other prominent football players from massachusetts ranked behind him in the globe analysis including heisman winners doug flutie and joe bellino indeed to this day he remains the only massachusetts high school player ever to earn allscholastic honors for three years he did so despite missing half his senior year to a separated shoulder early in the season against arlington high school after returning from his injury he scored an amazing 5 touchdowns in his last 7 carriers as a senior as a junior he easily led the state in scoring his play at everett caught the attention of scouts from all the big name schools at the time and leo was offered scholarships to notre dame michigan and others his everett squad won one of its many state championships his final year they went on to lose a onepoint game to miami senior high in the high school national championship game his senior year leo chose to attend harvard where he won awards and he became the

five players on the depth chart in the teams official 1968 media guide at the half back position however during the long preseason which was 6 games at the time and included games against both afl and nfl teams the coaching staff decided to move him to receiver again with great success he had a productive game at that position against the saints in a game played at tulane university against the jets in a game in richmond virginia he led the team both in pass receptions and receiving yards and was moved to the starting lineup the following week against the dolphins he concluded his success at flanker by scoring in an afl v nfl game against the philadelphia eagles at his old stomping grounds harvard stadium and serving as the teams primary kick returner during that time however various
