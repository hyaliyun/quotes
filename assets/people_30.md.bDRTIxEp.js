robert e hopkins frieden is now an emeritus professor of optical sciences at the university of arizonafrieden is best known for his extensive work on fisher information as a grounding principle for deriving and elaborating physical theory examples are the schrdinger wave equation of quantum mechanics and the maxwellboltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics such theories take the form of differential equations or probability distribution functionscentral to friedens derivations is the mathematical variational principle of extreme physical information epi this principle builds on the wellknown idea that the observation of a source phenomenon is never completely accurate that is information is inevitably lost in transit from source to observation furthermore the random errors that creep in are presumed to define the distribution function of the source phenomenon as frieden puts it the physics lies in the fluctuations finally the information loss may be shown to be an extreme value thus if the observed level of fisher information in the data has value i and the level of fisher information that existed at the source has value j the epi principle states that i j extremum in most situations the extremum is a minimum meaning that there is a tendency for any observation to faithfully match up with its sourcefrieden has used fisher information and the epi principle to derive most existing fundamental laws of physics and some new and existing laws of biology cancer growth chemistry and economics frieden argues that fisher information especially its loss i j during

pioneering contributions in the earliest days of development of the organometallic chemistry of the transition metals he was among the first to demonstrate the intermolecular insertion of transition metals into carbon hydrogen bonds known as ch bond activation and with rooney he proposed a mechanism to explain stereochemical control in zieglernatta polymerization that was based on an initial alpha ch activation step this was in contrast to the cosseearlman mechanism that involves a betainsertion step although incorrect the debate over this mechanism stimulated extensive work in the field he developed metal vapour synthesis invented originally by peter timms as a technique isolating a huge range of unusual compounds of extreme electron richness and reactivityhe and his students designed and synthesised striking examples of metalalkyl compounds containing metalhydrogencarbon bonds which he named agostic bonds the word was suggested to him by jasper griffin professor of classics at balliol college oxford whom green asked for an appropriate greek word to describe the close bonding phenomenon agostos is an obscure word in homer which seems to mean clinging tightly this would later lead to green and brookharts modified greenrooney mechanism for zieglernatta catalysis involving agostic control of the transition state a suggestion that has found wide acceptance in the literature through the work of john bercaw h h brintzinger and othersin the late 1980s green moved into the field of heterogeneous catalysts of hydrocarbon reactions and discovered highly selective metal carbide catalysts for the catalytic partial oxidation of methane this led to the spinoff company oxford catalysts plc in 1990 green initiated fundamental studies into the world of carbon

noting the general similarity between the sephirot of the kabbalah and the tree of life of assyrian mysticism he reconstructed what an assyrian antecedent to the sephirot would look like matching the characteristics of ein sof on the nodes of the sephirot to the gods of assyria he found textual parallels between these assyrian gods and the characteristics of the jewish godthe assyrians assigned specific numbers to their gods similar to the way the kabbalah assigns numbers to the nodes of the sephirot however the assyrians used a sexagesimal number system whereas the sephirot use a decimal system using the assyrian numbers additional layers of meaning and mystical relevance appear in the sephirot normally floating above the assyrian tree of life was the god assurthis corresponds to ein sof which is also via a series of transformations supposedly derived from the akkadian word assurparpola reinterpreted various assyrian tablets in the terms of these primitive sephirot such as the epic of gilgamesh and concluded that the scribes had been writing philosophicalmystical tracts rather than mere adventure stories traces of this assyrian mode of thought and philosophy eventually reappeared in greek philosophy and the kabbalahparpola is also the chairman of the finland assyria association suomiassyria yhdistys"},{"author":"Anatole Marie Nkou","quote":"anatole fabien marie nkou

pilot who successfully defected after the tiananmen square protest of 1989 and he was also the first chinese pilot who defected to taiwan after the taiwanese reward for such defection was greatly reduced jiang was also the first chinese pilot who successfully defected with the defection prevention system onboard his jetjiang wenhao was born in leshan and was a graduate of the 13th aviation school at the time of his defection he had totaled 600 hours of flying and he left behind his parents maternal grandmother and a younger sister on september 6 1989 jiang wenhao the 23year old plaaf lieutenant of the 2nd wing of the 145th regiment of the 49th division flew a shenyang j6 numbered 40307 from longxi airport zhangzhou fujian to shangyi airport in kinmen utilizing the blind spot of radars jiang made a speedy dive near the sea level after climbing to 300 metres and was not detected by radars on either side however once he was climbed back to 300 metres near the coast of kinmen he was discovered by an air defense observer gan lin on the ground when he was above kinmen who immediately reported the antiaircraft artillery command and the whole kinmen island was put on alert shots were fired at jiang including 5 rounds from bofors 40 mm gun 56 rounds of 127 mm from 50 calibre heavy machine gun jiang immediately put down the landing gear and pitched the wings and the ground fire stopped shortly after jiang discovered the shangyi airport in kinmen and landed safely the island was then no longer on alert which lasted 14 minutesin order to avoid possible chinese interceptions jiang disguised as a republic of china air force major and was first boarded a naval transport ship to pescadores on september 7 at night reaching the pescadores at the dawn from there a republic of china air force beechcraft 1900 transport aircraft was sent in the morning of september 8 at 730 am and flown jiang to taipei at 1000 am in the afternoon taiwan held a news conference for jiang at 300 pm on september 29 1989 jiang publicly denounced his communist party membership and joined the republic of china air force as a lieutenant jiang was sworn in by the then chiefofgeneralstaff of taiwanese armed forces hau peitsunthe subsequent taiwanese evaluation of shenyang j6 flew by jiang wenhao revealed that the chinese aircraft was equipped with an antidefection system that was similar to an automobile antitheft system this was one of the measures taken after an earlier defection by another plaaf pilot liu zhiyuan on november 19 1987 the system would warning pilots with acoustic signals and visual signals such as a flashing red light when the aircraft was strayed away from its predetermined routes if the signals were not responded to within thirty seconds and the aircraft continued to stray further the system would automatically cut the fuel supply and shut down every system onboard unless the pilot returned to the predetermined route as a result no chinese pilots would be able to fly to taiwan jiang defeated this defection prevention system by selecting kinmen as his destination and for the island that was just next to the mainland he was well within the allowed range of the predetermined routesjiangs financial reward however was far less than previous chinese defectors and this was due to the reduced tensions between mainland china and taiwan during the 1980s on september 11 1988 as a goodwill gesture china completely abolished the rewards for future taiwanese defectors four days later on september 15 1988 taiwan greatly reduced its rewards on the future chinese defectors in response as a result jiang only received a reduced amount of 2000 taels approximately 100 kg of gold from the original 5000 taels approximately 250 kg if he had defected before september 15 1988 due to the depreciation of international gold price jiangs reward was not enough to buy a luxury mansion near yangmingshan region the most expansive piece of real estate in entire taiwan jiang was only rewarded with a rank of lieutenant in the republic of china air force a rank that is much lower in comparison to those awarded to previous chinese defectorsinevitably jiang wenhao claimed that he was disillusioned about the communist regime in china due to tiananmen square protest of 1989 and was cheered as a hero by chinese democracy movement although this was certainly part of his reason for defection subsequent taiwanese investigations revealed that the economic reason was the major cause jiang openly admitted that he had been seriously planning to defecting in secrecy for a year well before the tiananmen square protest of 1989 and the first thought of defection came two years before the actual defection jiang also admitted that he was greatly disappointment with the backwardness of the chinese economy in comparison to the taiwanese economy and he was also dissatisfied with the drop of status and financial rewards of the chinese military because deng xiaopings policy of putting the military development funding in the backseat in his economic reformsas viewed by jiang wenhaos critics jiangs financial motive was soon obvious after he received his much reduced rewards jiang soon got out of the republic of china air force and among all chinese defectors his service in the republic of china air force was the shortest after jiangs admission of his main cause for defection was made public the resulting public support for him in taiwan was not as great as previous defectors as shown by a poll conducted on 658 adults in taiwan half of those 658 supported political parties that later formed panblue coalition and the other half supported political parties that later formed pangreen coalition 26 believed that the publicity of this defection incident should be minimized while 7 believed that it should be treated just the way it was response from this two categories came almost exclusively from the supporters of future panblue coalition 21 believed that the incident should be more publicized in order to maximize its political propaganda potential for taiwan and this response was also mostly from the supporters of future panblue coalition though there are some supporters of future pangreen coalition also provided the same response the largest and most shocking response came from the majority of the supporters of future pangreen coalition for that they believed that jiang was an illegal immigrant and should be either repatriated to china or a third country because they wanted nothing to do with chinaafter jiangs honorable discharge from the republic of china air force as a captain jiang became a famed underwater photographer and won several awards and also worked as a diving

this world of unacknowledged knowledge that runs parallel to our world of articulated thoughts and actions it is a world filled with undeniable truths immersed in great mysteryin making my dances i often draw directly from movements found in our daily lives an embrace a touch a turn of the head simple walking and running this familiar vocabulary has the ability to communicate swiftly and clearly i am interested in using such movements in their natural form and not in a stylized way because i believe that unadorned these movements can communicate the depth of our livesin 1988 marshall was an

1968 silver developed a highquality but lowtack adhesive made of tiny indestructible acrylic spheres that would stick only where they were tangent to a given surface rather than flat up against it spencer used the patented formula from shiro takemoto as a result the adhesives grip was strong enough to hold papers together but weak enough to allow the papers to be pulled apart again without being torn more importantly the adhesive could be used again and again silver wanted to market the adhesive as a spray or as a surface for bulletin boards on which temporary notices could be easily posted and then removed over the next five years silver tried to interest his colleagues at 3m informally and in presentations a marketable form of the product proved elusive however until arthur fry attended one of silvers seminars fry sang in his church choir he was frustrated with the paper bookmarks he used to mark the songs in his hymnal because they would not stay put in a moment of insight fry realized that silvers reusable adhesive would provide precisely what he neededfry wrote up his idea for a reusable bookmark and presented it to his supervisors initially management was skeptical but the staff could not get enough of the samples fry was passing around soon 3m gave the invention its full support it took another five years to perfect and design machines to manufacture the
