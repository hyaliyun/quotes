Hate is not the opposite of love, but indifference is.</p><p>---002---</p><p>Feelings of emptiness or hollowness...are primarily caused by a person&#39;s feeling of &quot;inability&quot; to make a difference in his life or in the world he lives in. The inner emptiness is the result of a long-term accumulation of paralyzing feelings such as the individual&#39;s inability to become a meaningful entity in directing his own life, the inability to change the attitudes of others towards him, or the inability to effectively influence the world around him. In this case, he is trapped in a sense of despair and helplessness.</p><p>---003---</p><p>Man cannot live for long in a state of emptiness - if he cannot grow in some direction, he cannot simply stagnate; his long-imprisoned potential will turn into morbidity and despair, and in the end, will inevitably lead to destructive behavior.</p><p>---004---</p><p>True &quot;rebellion&quot; is not indulging in childish challenges, but a kind of defense of self-dignity and spirit. It is a person learning to respect himself and others&#39; right to say &quot;no&quot;. It will not bring relationship entanglements or self-guilt. On the contrary, individuals can feel real freedom and respect from others.</p><p>---005---</p><p>Indifference and lack of feeling are also a tool for defending against anxiety. When an individual is constantly faced with crises that he is unable to overcome, his ultimate line of defense is to avoid feeling these crises.</p><p>---006---</p><p>Only those who are sensitive enough to transcend the ambiguous conflicts of the mind can present our world in a profound form.</p><p>---007---</p><p>Freedom is the mother of all values, and in this it is unique. If we consider values ​​such as honesty, love, or courage, we find that, surprisingly enough, none of them can be compared to the value of freedom. For all other values ​​derive their value from freedom; they depend on freedom.</p><p>---008---</p><p>The greatest tragedy of life is not when people die, but when they cease to love.</p><p>---009---</p><p>Courage is not the absence of despair; on the contrary, it is the ability to press on despite despair.</p><p>---010---</p><p>Anxiety is the basic human condition.</p><p>---011---</p><p>From the irony of past experience, it is not difficult to see that: when we lose our way, we tend to run faster; when we lose the meaning and value of love, we tend to turn more eagerly to sexual research, statistics and technical guidance.</p><p>---012---</p><p>Will without love becomes manipulation, and love without will becomes sentimentality, lacking a practical basis in reality.</p><p>---013---</p><p>Psychological problems are formed by the dialectical movement of three factors: biological, personal, and historical and social.</p><p>---014---</p><p>Rank: The neurotic is a kind of &quot;artist&#39;s paralysis&quot;, a neurotic is a person who is &quot;incapable&quot; of injecting his conflicts into art.</p><p>---015---</p><p>The denial of evil is the denial of freedom.</p><p>---016---</p><p>Both the artist and the neurotic experience and express the subconscious and unconscious aspects of their own world. The artist connects his own experience with his fellow man in a positive way. The neurotic connects his own unfortunate experience with his fellow man in a negative way. The neurotic experiences the contradictions and the vulgar meanings of his culture just as the artist does, but is unable to formulate a &quot;communicative&quot; meaning of his experience for himself and his fellow man.</p><p>---017---</p><p>In fact, the least sexy thing is nakedness, and we have to inject our imagination into physiology and anatomy, make it into a human experience, inject it into art, inject it into passion, inject it into love, and then re-express it in a million forms. Only then can it have the magic to shock us or overwhelm us.</p><p>---018---</p><p>Freedom makes evil inevitable. As long as there is freedom, there will be bad choices, some of which will be disastrous. But to abandon our ability to make choices in favor of that tyrannical aspect called reason is to abandon what makes us human in the first place.</p><p>---019---</p><p>The progress of science and technology has not led to a decrease in evil. Human cruelty and the energy of evil have grown in tandem with the progress of human technology. Our way of killing has become more efficient, as has our way of living.</p><p>---020---</p><p>The emergence of will is not a negation of desire, but a merging and elevating of desire to a higher level of consciousness.</p><p>---021---</p><p>What is the nature of freedom? The essence of freedom is precisely that its nature is not given. Its function is to change its nature, to become something different from what it is at any given moment. Freedom is the possibility of development, of the elevation of one&#39;s life; or it can be withdrawal, silence, the denial of one&#39;s growth or its absurdity.</p><p>---022---</p><p>Do not confuse the moral ought to be, which exists only in the realm of human reason and has its vital responsibilities, with the has to be of personal destiny, which exists in our deepest and most fundamental existence.</p><p>---023---</p><p>The ultimate error is to refuse to confront evil. This denial of evil—and the freedom that goes with it—is the most destructive orientation.</p><p>---024---</p><p>The artist clearly presents a fragmented image of &quot;man,&quot; but when he injects this fragmented image into art, he transcends it. This creative act makes sense of all nihilism, alienation, and other factors of the human condition.</p><p>---025---</p><p>Evil will not disappear or retreat during the night. We will never wake up in the morning to find that evil has disappeared from the face of the earth. The purpose of life is not to avoid mistakes or to remain flawless, but to rise to the challenges our destiny reveals and to search for our freedom in the challenges.</p><p>---026---</p><p>Psychotherapy explores the most specific qualities and events in the life of a particular individual--less effective when it is framed in sterile, unreal, generalities. It explores the fundamental elements of personal conflict, the most enduring qualities of each person&#39;s experience--if these fundamental elements are ignored, all psychotherapy will weaken the patient&#39;s consciousness and make his life more dull.</p><p>---027---</p><p>The artist is able to use the form of his candle to penetrate the depths of his consciousness and verify his own existence in the process of trying to shape his own world.</p><p>---028---</p><p>People have adopted an unhealthy psychological orientation. People are in the torrent of change, and they don&#39;t know what they really want or whether their feelings are real; this has caused confusion in our values. In order to eliminate loneliness, we seek help from others as much as possible, but paradoxically, the more we need others to help us overcome loneliness, the lonelier we become.</p><p>---029---</p><p>If people think about being alone for a long time, without anyone to talk to or any radio playing, they often feel fearful that they will be on the &#39;loose end&#39;, that they will lose their boundaries, that they will have nothing to touch, nothing to orient themselves to.</p><p>---030---</p><p>The belief that physical nature and the human body can be controlled mechanically and mathematically has enormous anxiety-removing effects, not only in terms of meeting human material needs and overcoming natural threats, but also in terms of freeing humans from the effects of irrational fears and anxieties.</p><p>---031---</p><p>Feelings of emptiness or hollowness…are primarily caused by a person’s feeling of “inability” to make a difference in his or her life or in the world he or she lives in. The inner emptiness is the result of a long-term accumulation of paralyzing feelings such as the individual’s inability to be a meaningful entity in directing his or her own life, the inability to influence the attitudes of others toward him or her, or the inability to effectively affect the world around him or her.</p><p>---032---</p><p>Indifference is the withdrawal of love and will, love and will &quot;no longer matter&quot; and no longer carry out the promise.</p><p>---033---</p><p>A unique creative genius will never retreat into a belief in fate to escape anxiety and guilt. He will move forward through anxiety and guilt to create possibilities.</p><p>---034---</p><p>Unless I can experience something, I cannot understand it.</p><p>---035---</p><p>An ironic habit of humans is that when they are lost, they tend to run faster.</p><p>---036---</p><p>Willfulness is the freedom to ignore fate, without the limitations that are the basis of authentic freedom, like night to day. As we will see, the components of freedom are how you face your limitations and how you commit yourself to your destiny in your daily life.</p><p>---037---</p><p>When one&#39;s will conflicts with the necessities of life, our deeper destiny is revealed.</p>",73)]))}const u=t(a,[["render",s]]);export{d as __pageData,u as default};
