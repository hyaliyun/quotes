Intelligent liberals have always recognized the debt they owe to radicals, whose existence permits liberals to push further than they would otherwise have dared, all the while posing as compromisers and mediators. Radicals, however, have been somewhat less sensible of their debt to liberals, partly because of the rather single-minded discipline radicals are almost forced to maintain, plagued as they always are by liberal backsliding and timidity on the one hand and various forms of self-destructiveness and romantic posing on the other.... Liberal reforms and radical change are thus complementary rather than antagonistic. Together they make it possible continually to test the limits of what can be done. Liberals never know whether the door is unlocked because they are afraid to try it. Radicals, on the other hand, miss many opportunities for small advances because they are unwilling to settle for so little.</p><p>Labour was the first price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things.

The moral pieties, that are voiced today by many well meaning environmentalists, are as naive as the moral pieties of multinationals are manipulative. Capitalism can no more be &quot;persuaded&quot; to limit growth than a human being can be &quot;persuaded&quot; to stop breathing.

It is the ligament which holds civilized beings and civilized nations together.</p><p>Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome restraint.</p><p>Let us not forget that the cultivation of the earth is the most important labor of man.

Let ?em wonder. I never believed in givin? them too much of me.</p><p>I was pure as the driven snow, then I drifted.</p><p>Too much of a good thing can be taxing.</p><p>Another unsettling element in modern art is that common symptom of immaturity, the dread of doing what has been done before.</p><p>A man is called selfish, not for pursuing his own good, but for neglecting the neighbor&#39;s.</p><p>All men wish to have truth on their side; but few to be on the side of truth.</p><p>There is nothing more likely to start disagreement among people or countries than an agreement.</p><p>Is there anything in the universe more beautiful and protective than the simple complexity of a spider&#39;s web?</p><p>The future ... seems to me no unified dream but a mince pie, long in the baking, never quite done.</p><p>When I was a child people simply looked about them and were moderately happy; today they peer beyond the seven seas, bury themselves waist deep in tidings, and by and large what they see and hear makes them unutterably sad.</p><p>Everything in life is somewhere else, and you get there in a car.</p><p>One main factor in the upward trend of animal life has been the power of wandering.</p><p>O to be self balanced for contingencies!
