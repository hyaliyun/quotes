january 1961 in brussels is a belgian sociologist and social theorist based in britain he is professor of social theory at the university of cambridge and fellow of selwyn college cambridgebaert studied at the free university of brussels and at oxford university where he obtained his dphil in 1990 in oxford he studied with rom harr and wrote his dissertation on george herbert meads notion of time and its relevance for social theory subsequently published as time self and social being he carried out postdoctoral work with claude javeau in brussels and anthony giddens in cambridge before taking up a teaching position at cambridge he has held various visiting positions including brown university the university of cape town the cnrsehess and the university of british columbia he also published social theory in the twentieth century and beyond and philosophy of the social sciences towards pragmatism since january 2013 he is the editorinchief of the international journal of politics culture and societybaert argues against several existing contributions to the philosophy of social sciences against those philosophies of social science that infer prescriptions for the social sciences based on attempts to demarcate science from nonscience he argues that developments in the history and sociology of science have undermined the validity of the notion of demarcation contrary to those social scientists who liken their empirical research to an arbitration court that helps to decide the fate of the theory or research programme under consideration he contends that research in the social sciences relies on theoretical presuppositions which are contestable and contested to such an extent that empirical research cannot be regarded as a straightforward testing device in opposition to what he coins the social cartography model according to which highquality social research captures the inner essence of the social world as accurately and completely as possible and social theory provides the conceptual building blocks for this representation he argues that it is not fruitful to conceive of research in terms of the passive recording of the external world and that this representational model ultimately leads to theoretical ossificationbaert argues in favour of a neopragmatist philosophy of social science which promotes social research in the pursuit of selfreferential knowledge whereas many contributions to the philosophy of social science assume that social research is primarily an explanatory and possibly predictive endeavor baert contends that this picture does not correspond to the actual practice of social research he points out that few significant contributions to sociology and social research in general are straightforward explanatory works and even fewer are exclusively explanatory baerts position is that most of those groundbreaking works involve selfreferential knowledge they enable communities to redescribe and reconceptualise themselves and their presuppositions inspired by rortys neopragmatism he has argued in favour of the pursuit of selfreferential knowledge and he has analysed the methodological strategies that make this possible in various disciplines ranging from archaeology and social anthropology to sociology and history for instance nietzsches genealogical history can provide contemporary communities with tools that enable them to reevaluate the moral and cognitive categories they use to describe the world and their place within it baers notion of selfreferential knowledge relates to the german notion of bildung or selfedification and with a new role for intellectuals whereby they facilitate envisaging alternative sociopolitical scenarios rather than presenting a set of normative or epistmeological foundationsa special issue of the journal human studies was dedicated to a symposium around baerts philosophy of the social sciences towards pragmatism in this issue stephen turner questioned baerts attempt to promote dialogue whilst holding onto a notion of expertise in the same issue paul roth argues that baert contradicts himself whilst rightly rejecting the notion of a scientific method baert then surprisingly suggests a method for pursuing selfreferential knowledge bohman contends that baert underestimates the ability of social scientists to develop generalisations which can lead to emancipatory political agendas for a critical exchange between baert and peter manicas see the journal of critical realism whilst sympathetic to dewey manicas disagrees with baerts neopragmatism for a

isu presidency at the age of 56 he retired from his position as a manager of an international chemical companywhen cinquanta was first elected to the isu presidency he was initially regarded as a progressive who introduced prize money at isu events after negotiating several commercial contracts including an important television contract with abc sports this allowed the isu to retain athletes who might have otherwise left olympiceligible skating to participate in unsanctioned madefortelevision professional skating competitions which were then offering large appearance fees to top skaters the television money also allowed the isu to sustain a variety of development programs in both figure skating and speed skating branches including for example the isu grand prix of figure skating however because of his speed skating background cinquanta has been the subject of a considerable amount of criticism from the figure skating community particularly in canada and the united states during the 2002 olympic winter games figure skating scandal he was criticized for his evasiveness and his admission that he didnt know figure skating so well in spite of his professed lack of knowledge about the sport he proposed a new scoring system for figure skating whose major feature is secrecy which would prevent anyone from ever knowing how an individual judge had marked the competition the implementation of secret judging at the 2003 world figure skating championships in washington dc was controversial enough to result in a fan protest at that event with cinquanta
