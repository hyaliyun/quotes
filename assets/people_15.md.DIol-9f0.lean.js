work is perhaps the book wwii victims in yugoslavia published in london in 1985 in sebocroatian koovi compared the censuses from 1921 1931 and 1948 and assuming the possible population growth at 11 and emigration in that period obtained the demographic and actual losses of yugoslavia during the world war ii he clearly stated that his estimates depended on these assumptions and that if other

error of 250000 however the official number upheld by the yugoslav communist regime was 1706000 though koovics estimate was rough it indicated that the official figure was possibly too highkoovis book

pieces are entirely nonfunctional like untitled wooden toilet which as its title suggests is an unpainted wooden toilet that serves most usefully as a witty conversation piece more so than an actual toilet many of his pieces are inspired by visual and verbal puns and other conceptual conceits a boudoir in which every drawer is painted a different shade of white and every drawer knob is a slightly different size or a white shag rug with a black square at its center that has had a quarter of its area shaved away showing that in order for the graphic flatness of the square to be realized black thread must permeate the entire thickness of the rug drawing our attention to the threedimensionality of something that we ordinarily perceive as twodimensional mcmakins art forces us to focus on the ontological complexities of furniture that while it occupies the same space as sculpture is not culturally recognized as such another example would be his untitled writing table and chair which while fully functional is painted a bright pink making the table and chair appear more as an objet dart than an actual desk mcmakins furniture designs first came to public attention in 1987 through his domestic furniture showroom on los angeles beverly boulevard that store closed in 1994 when he moved to seattle to be closer to the woods with which he was working but selected pieces from that period are still manufactured by his seattle workshopcurator michael darling has argued that mcmakins intellectual tack to furniture was informed by his artistic education at the university of california san diego which was a hotbed of artistic engagement with the everyday from allan kaprow inventor of the happening to domestic conceptualist eleanor antin environmental art pioneers helen mayer harrison and newton harrison the ucsd faculty espoused boundarybreaking experimental approaches to artmaking this boundarybreaking extends to mcmakins growing body of architectural work with his firm domestic architecture beginning with remodels of homes and office spaces in the 1990s the artist now has a portfolio of groundup houses that take his artistic concerns to a new level of ambition and complexity notable within the contemporary architectural scene mcmakins homes freely embrace vernacular idioms but utilize them in a way that is neither ironic nostalgic nor ideological borrowing from a wide variety of sources to best address the site climate or clients taste and personality the homes are as engaging to read and deconstruct from an intellectual standpoint as they are intuitively functional mcmakins architecture neatly dovetails with his other pursuits in furniture and sculpture held together by an overarching investigation of how perception influences meaningmcmakin has been the subject of exhibitions at the museum of contemporary art los angeles the henry art gallery in seattle and the portland art museum in 2010 skira rizzoli published a comprehensive monograph on
