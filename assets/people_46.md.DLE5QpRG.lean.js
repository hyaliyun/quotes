kiesling has held previous academic positions at the university of sydney and the ohio state university scott kiesling is best known for his studies of language and identity particularly the construction of masculinity and gender his work treats dominant social categories such as masculinity heterosexuality and whiteness as social constructions achieved via discourse and language behavior among other social behaviors in his work with american fraternity members kiesling suggests that men are expected to demonstrate both solidarity a condition of closeness with other men and heterosexuality which precludes intimacy with other men he suggests that one way to show these complicated relationships is through the use of cool language elements such as the word dude or sundry nonstandard language variantskiesling is also known for work in sociolinguistics and language variation in both american english and australian english for example in a 1996 paper kiesling suggests that some american men use alveolar ing tokens eg walkin rather than walking to index power roles associated with workingclass men and indirectly with the values of hard work and physical strength similarly a 2005 paper finds that greek and lebanese speakers in australia pronounce wordfinal er as in brother further back in vocal space and longer than anglo speakers do for some speakers this

the developmental neurocognition lab at birkbeck university of london before moving to birbeck she was head of the neurocognitive development unit at institute of child health university college london she is an expert in developmental disorders with a particular interest in williams syndrome professor karmiloffsmith argues againstapproaches that take a modalityspecific approach to developmental disorders approaches that state for example that autism arises because of a failure of the theory of mind module or that children with specific language impairment lack a genetically determined language modulekarmiloffsmith has argued that these approaches assume a mosaiclike approach to cognitive development according to which different systems within the brain develop separately from each other based purely on information coded in the genes the real picture of development is she argues much more complicated see interactive specialization development comes about as a result of backpropagating interactions between gene brain behavior and the environment modules those parts of the brain that are for example specialized at processing language appear relatively late in development since developmental disorders arise from problems during development as opposed to damage to a mature system it follows that we should expect to find performance deficits that are not linked to one particular domain but rather spread across a whole range of different performance impairments karmiloffsmith has supported her theories by her research work into williams syndrome this rare syndrome was originally thought to manifest itself as abnormally low iq accompanied by normal ability to process social cues in a series of papers eg karmiloffsmith and colleagues have discovered that impairments in williams syndrome are far more widespread than had previously been appreciated her theories have been further supported by work in other fields for example autistic children have been found to be impaired not just at theory of mind but also at a variety of tasks including motion perception visual search and multitasking eg a finding that domainspecific theories have difficulty

share their lytic vacuolar compartments this stems from his earlier symbiosome or lysosome theory which states that the organelle that microsymbionts inhabit partially takes over the lysosomal functions in these cells analogous to the role of protein bodies in seedsin other works mellor has claimed that in legumes the root nodule cytoplasm may be under water stress and the plant may combat this by producing trehalose indeed this may explain why nodulated plants have a higher droughttolerance than nonnodulated plantsmellor was also very interested in how plants distinguish between symbiotic and pathogenic infections and in 1984 set about measuring defence responses in nodules infected with different rhizobial mutants and it gradually appeared that in rhizobia the nod genes are responsible for producing different nod factors lipochitin molecules and that amongst their many effects was that they can provoke plant defence responses so that it was essential that these genes were switched off by molecules called nodoffs after infection or that symbiosis could not take place this convincing model won general acclaim and indeed the paper with david collinge was later reprinted as that years number one most important publicationhowever mellor was also interested in applied science and invented and a patented system to power immobilized oxidoreductase enzymes and

rather with a structuralist analysis and in this regard he gives reference to philosophers michel foucault and louis althusser of aaltos works in terms of the themes that can be said to have generated

ocular oncology research society he has served on numerous grant review panels is a frequent reviewer for scientific journals and conferences has given many invited lectures and has often served as a moderator at scientific conferences silverman has helped pioneer the use of ultrasound in ophthalmology he developed a multivariate statistical model based on ultrasound spectral parameters to differentiate metastatic carcinoma and two subtypes of uveal malignant melanoma publication of these findings in 1983 represented one of the first reports in the literature of medical diagnosis based on multivariate statistical analysis and one of the earliest applications of ultrasound tissue characterization silverman was involved in the development of the use of highintensity ultrasound for treatment of glaucoma this project involved direction of an intense focused ultrasound beam at the region of the ciliary body to cause cyclodestruction this project eventually led to a commercial device sonocare inc manufactured under license by cornell and a multicenter clinical trial silverman was instrumental in compiling and providing statistical analysis of treatment results from over a thousand patients treated for refractory glaucoma by this device at over 20 centers the device became the first fdaapproved highintensity focused ultrasound hifu system several commercial hifu systems are now in clinical use although laser techniques based on this groundbreaking effort have supplanted this technique while working fulltime at cornell silverman spent his evenings studying computer science at polytechnic university for a phd following his interest in multivariate analysis he became interested in the then obscure field of neural networks simulated nonlinear interconnected processing units designed to perform pattern recognition in a manner loosely connected to how the brain performs such tasks silverman implemented a new technique called backpropagation as part of his dissertation he demonstrated how a multiscaled nonlinear neural net could be used for automatic pattern recognition to localize tumors in ultrasound bscans and then to access the underlying echo data and then perform a nonlinear multidimensional analysis to classify the tumor type this work represented the first use of neural nets in medical imaging and the first use of neural nets for medical diagnosis silverman received his doctorate for this work in 1990in the early 1990s silverman was instrumental in the development and clinical application of one of the first very high frequency

resolution of about 30 micrometres working with dan reinstein silverman developed software for processing 3d scans of the cornea that allowed measurement and mapping of corneal thickness as well as the thickness of the stroma and epithelium they also found that they could detect and measure the flap interface in lasiktreated eyes and demonstrated epithelial thickening associated with regions where the stroma had been ablated while a major achievement the linear 3d scan system could only obtain data in the 3 mm zone of the central cornea due to its specularity silverman then developed a new 3d scan system with 5degrees of freedom this system allowed the cornea to be scanned in a series of arcs such that the beam axis was maintained orthogonal to the corneal surface and the focal point maintained on the surface this system allowed demonstration of the importance of arcscanning for corneal analysis and led to the subsequent development of a far simpler arcscan device with just two programmable axes this system led to a commercial system artemis2 ultralink llc manufactured under license from cornell universitysilverman working with katherine ferrara now chair biomedical
