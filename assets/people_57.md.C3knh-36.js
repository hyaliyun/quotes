material and molecular properties of vapors liquids and surfaces in particular he pioneered a sensitive interfacial forcesensing technique known as the surface forces apparatus sfa this instrument involves carefully approaching two surfaces usually immersed in a solvent such as water and measuring the force of attraction and repulsion between them using piezoelectric positional movement and optical interferometry for position sensing this instrument can resolve distances to within 01 nanometer and forces at the 108 n level this technique is similar to measuring the force of interaction between an atomic force microscope afm and a sample surface except that the specialized sfa can measure much longerrange forces and is intended for surfacesurface interaction measurements as opposed to tipsurface or moleculesurface measurements the results of sfa experiments can be used to characterize the nature of intermolecular potentials and other molecular propertiesisraelachvili is also

hydrodynamics traditional differential calculus is effective for linear and quasilinear problems it is less effective for essentially nonlinear problems a linear problem is the first approximation to a quasilinear problem usually a linear problem is solved by methods of functional analysis then the solution to the quasilinear problem is found as a perturbation of the solution to the linear problem for an essentially nonlinear problem we need to isolate its first approximations to find their solutions and to construct perturbations of these solutions this is what power geometry pg is aimed at for equations and systems of equations algebraic ordinary differential and partial differential pg allows to compute asymptotic forms of solutions as well as asymptotic and local expansions of solutions at infinity and at any singularity of the equations including boundary layers and singular perturbations elements of plane pg were proposed by i newton for an algebraic equation 1680 and by

systems biology the boston university program remains the largest and one of the most successful programs in the world delisi was an early champion of the controversial idea that in cell biology just as in the physical sciences the mathematical formulation of concepts could predict phenomena that would not otherwise be apparent and could thereby drive experimental research in new directions the approach is seen in a number of investigations his 1979 paper predicted several years in advance of experimental demonstration that the signal generated when nerve growth factor binds its plasma membrane receptor is transduced by receptor dimerization in immunology delisi was a strong proponent of the controversial hypothesis that the response of tcells to antigenic stimulation involves formation of a ternary complex predictions based on the mathematical formulation of that idea the amphipathic hypothesis provided strong support for what was ultimately demonstrated conclusively by xray crystallogrphy the mathematical methods developed initially with jay berzofsky were subsequently extended and modified by many others presaging the now widely used bioinformatic approaches to guide the design of peptide vaccinesat the same time the section on theoretical immunology sti which delisi founded several years earlier at the nih had introduced the use of supervised learning

of thought that would inform decisions about the development and deployment of the radically new technologies destined to emerge from the completion of the project in taking this step delisi was likely influenced by the fact that he was working for an agency that provided the vast majority of the nations nuclear physics budget and the awareness that the consequences of the rapid development of nucelar energy some four decades earlier continued to plague the planetin addition to the medical and scientific advances engendered by the human genome project it and its progeny have had a profound effect on the sociology and culture of cell biology the computer science community in particular moved with extraordinary dexterity into cell biology transforming the field and creating a

creating the endowed professorship that bears her nameduring his time at the nsf in the late 1980s he began researching the effects of changes in the sun on weather climate change and global warming on the decadal and century timescale he has been author of more than 40 papers he has proposed a mechanism in which the link to the atmosphere is the solar wind space weather as opposed to changes in solar brightnesshe formed the hypothesis that the jz effects are due to electrical charge deposited on droplets and aerosol particles notably condensation nuclei and iceforming nuclei in clouds that significantly affects scavenging processes and the concentrations of the nuclei the consequences of this include changes in cloud cover and rates of precipitation and changes in atmospheric dynamics and the jet streams as has been observeddr tinsley and dr burns of the australian antarctic research division and dr tinsleys graduate student leo hebert have shown that there are clear correlations between the electrical current output of the internal atmospheric generators thunderstorms in the global electric circuit and surface pressure at both antarctic and arctic sites fully consistent with the externally forced changes thus the work has led to the discovery of a completely unexpected process in meteorology that has implications for climate change that is that the internal generation of atmospheric electricity mostly in the tropical regions affects clouds and meteorological processes all over the globe and because this current generation changes on daily seasonal and longer timescales notably with global warming it is an additional input to weather and climate on those timescales that has not been included in current global climate change models also the solarinduced changes have yet to been included and both of these would modify the current predictions of global warming due to human activities"},{"author":"David Jost","quote":"david jost born 12 august 1972 is
