finnish critics were adamant that postmodernism was having no significant influence on architecture in finland one of the bastions of modernist architecture against this trend the paavilainens introduced a strain of playfulness colour and irony into modernism while part of the reasons for their style of architecture is certainly derived from following international trends this also took on a local concern in attempting to gain academic respectability the postmodern theorists such as charles jencks michael graves and charles willard moore turned their attention to earlier protopostmodernism one of the prime examples being the architecture in the nordic countries during the 1920s socalled nordic classicism and in particular the swedish architect gunnar asplund scholars in the nordic countries became well aware of the international attention and the architecture of that period which had been forgotten in the onslaught of modernism was then rediscovered as evident in various books and exhibitions simo paavilainen emerged as one of the key academics in the field but his interest then spilled over into his own architectural production in more recent years however

with prof sharon glotzer also of the university of michigan kotov established that inorganic nanoparticles can spontaneously selforganize into chains sheets nanowires and twodimensional and threedimensional particulate lattices their geometry being determined by the anisotropy of nanoparticle interactions the diversity and complexity of such assemblies approaches that of selfassembled structures of biomolecules a good example of the intricate selforganized assemblies possible for nanoparticles is the series of twisted ribbons prepared by kotovs research group that have nanoscale chiralitysupraparticles selfassembled from several hundred individual nanoparticles were reported by kotov and coworkers in 2011 and exemplify terminal selfassembled structures that can be related to other terminal assemblies such as micelles vesicles and virus capsids unlike their extended mesoscale counterparts their size and geometry is determined by the local equilibrium state originating from the balance of repulsive and attractive interactions the generic nature of such interactions makes possible a large variety of terminal supraparticle structures that may include different organic and inorganic componentskotov also investigated lbl multilayers from nanoplatelets of clay graphene graphene oxide and other nanoparticles as a pathway to new materials needed for flexible electronics energy storage biomedical implants and loadbearing elements the lbl materials are made by alternating deposition of thin films of nanoparticles and polymers kotov found that these composites replicate the structure and mechanical properties of nacre a natural composite whose protective function was perfected by evolution the uniform orientation and small size of nanoparticles also makes the

tullamore county offaly carr grew up in a household filled with literature both of her parents were writers her father was a novelist and a playwright and her mother was a poet and a teacher as a child she read childrens versions of greek myths these myths turned out to be major influences in many of her later works one of her favorite myths medea was used as an inspiration for her play by the bog of cats carrs mother died when she was just 17 influencing her future works such as by the bog of cats where the main character hester experienced a very similar tragedycarr attended university college dublin studying english and philosophy she graduated in 1987 she recently received a honorary degree of doctorate of literature from her alma mater she has held posts as writerinresidence at the abbey theatre trinity college dublin and princeton university she served as heimbold professor of irish studies at villanova university in 2003 and a professor of irish studies at villanova university she has written 16 plays since her career began and is considered one of irelands most prominent playwrights her awardwinning playslargely poetic tragedies of rural irish domestic lifehave been produced around the world she currently lives in kerry and is a member of aosdna her works have been translated into french german and norwegianlike the works of several other contemporary irish playwrights carrs plays frequently include instances of black humor and severe physical brutality she is distinguished however most notably by the fact that several of her plays are filled with classical greek allusion or are loose retellings of classical greek mythsin carrs early work carr experiments with style as she seeks to find her own low in the dark 1989 her first play is an absurdist piece in which gender roles and misconceptions are farcically addressed the style reflects her early interest in fellow irish playwright samuel beckett carrs next few experiments are the deer surrender 1990 this love thing 1991 and ullaloo 1991 she won the 1997 susan smith blackburn prizeher following play the mai 1994 won best new play from the dublin theatre festival and marked a shift in carrs writing style though it is not an adaptation of a greek play it has distinct classical resonances rising from questions of truth legacyheredity and fate the same can be said of her next play portia coughlan 1996 her other works include by the bog of cats 1998 a retelling of euripides medea on rafterys hill 2000 ariel 2002 a retelling of euripides iphigenia at aulis extended into the aftermath shown in aeschylus oresteia and woman and scarecrow 2006in correlation with greek supernatural and mystical themes that frequently resonate in marina carrs writing her playwright by the bog of cats succeeds in creating a dramatic and twisted story in only a few pages the drama is filled with several deceiving apparitions that contribute to the eccentricity of the storyline including the ghost fancier and main character hesters late brother on the surface the common theme throughout carrs writing seems to be greek myth it began with her play the mai 1994 is not complete a retelling of a greek myth but has strong connections to the story of electra told by sophocles and euripides her following play portia coughlan 1996 also has ties to greek themes although it is less directly related to one story by the bog of cats 1998 was a direct retelling of the medea myth euripides complete with a strong but fatal female character and the tragedy which becomes her the theme continued with carrs play ariel 2002 an adaptation of euripides iphigenia at aulis however if we take a deeper look the surpassing theme is powerful women carr regularly casts women from these famous tragedies as the protagonist in her own playwrights but reviving the betrayal desperation and revenge in a more modern style focusing on the female aspect although carr is not a feminist her plays bolster femininity and defy previous thoughts of weak women into ones of strengthtypically greek myths contain female characters however they are never the principal character and males are behaviorally more dominant though in carrs by the bog of cats a retelling of the famous medea myth we see a complete flip side to this approach where carr casts the main character is a fierce and empowered woman main character hester swane an irish traveller attempts to cope with her life of consistent abandonment by going to extreme lengths to regain the people who have already discarded her through many desperate attempts to reclaim her exfianc and father of her sevenyearold daughter carthage killbride she succeeds in further turning the backs of her fellow citizens on her making her appear as a mad and delusional woman however hester does not succumb to the ruthlessness of her neighbors and proceeds in an extreme act of selfsacrifice for not only herself by her daughter rejecting a path of further isolation and loneliness by the bog of cats presents a riveting tale of richly entwined characters that turns a once uncompromising greek myth into a pageturning strangely relatable drama of greed and betrayalin february 2009 carr debuted two plays in dublin marble at the abbey theatre directed by jeremy herrin and a childrens play the giant blue hand at dublins cultural centre for
