There must be some shining drops of red-hot gonads, a jukebox with milky white light. There must be all forms of activity for children, bathing in the sun, paddling canoes, dancing the Kulam, combing curls. There must have been white mist, apple trees, a star-shaped seed. There must have been a fire opal melting in a pool of ripples, a thrill of color, a smear of color, a stinging red, a sharp pink, a little sigh, a wincing child.</p><p>---029---</p><p>I looked at her, and I knew, as if I knew I was going to die, and I knew it for her, and I loved her so much, more than I had ever seen or imagined.

This is not the child&#39;s interest in his own lively thoughts and fantasies; and the child&#39;s interest in the people and things that are visible to him.</p><p>---059---</p><p>Our witches, our demons, are these precious, shining creatures with translucent claws and powerful flapping wings; most of them were born in the ninth century, and they came to teach these &quot;new believers&quot; to think that they would become like her: our best friend has completely fallen and become an unforgivable villain. A monster, a disgusting demon, with the black scrotum of a carnivorous animal and the fangs of a snake, who insulted and tortured the actress in every possible way; but he finally became another good person in this universe, a good person who made the elves rise up with rainbow-like mist. It seems that we are beautiful. &quot;It seems that at that time, we were born in the country. It seems that we will restore all the old ways for him.

The contact of the body and the reaction and desire to the contact are like the huge swing of the desperate signal. It can&#39;t help but tremble. It&#39;s endless, regular, and graceful. You use your lips to brush my lips, tease this angry flower, back and forth, left and right, and die in the contrast between the softness and the swelling and congestion of the hidden flesh in this open pastoral poetry.</p><p>---070---</p><p>How many times has Van cheated on me since September 1884? Six hundred, Van replied. You have used hundreds of prostitutes, and I will never caress you. I will remain absolutely faithful to you, because these are just &quot;pseudo-operations&quot;</p><p>---071---</p><p>It is not necessary to be so vigorous as to be a good person, that is, to be rich, with a long yellow beard and a bald head, and to be a bad tempered, sleepless, and like to chop off the heads of mice.</p><p>---072---</p><p>Most letters between husband and wife are difficult to show. Even when famous writers write to their spouses, there is little interest in them. Noel Joyce&#39;s love letters to her son are famous for their obscenity, but not for their lyricism. Of all the letters Virginia Wood wrote to her husband, only the last one - the &quot;suicide letter&quot; in which she thanks him for &quot;many blessings in life&quot; - survives in the reader&#39;s memory. Nabokov&#39;s letters to his wife are unusually vivid and memorable. These letters are so funny, romantic and pithy that they can hardly be reduced to a few good words.</p><p>---073---</p><p>And this final pleasure of timelessness—in a randomly chosen landscape—is to be found among the rare butterflies and the plants they feed on. It is an intoxication, and what it is to be intoxicated is hard to explain. They are like a fleeting space and time, into which everything I love rushes. A feeling of being one with the sun and the stone. A thrill of gratitude…</p><p>---074---</p><p>Originally the most refreshing, it makes other poems seem cumbersome and impure.</p><p>---075---</p><p>Style and structure are only the essence of a novel; great ideas are just empty nonsense.</p><p>---076---</p><p>It is impossible for a writer to have a good life in the first place without his characters suffering and going through a revolution. This is a violation of the writer&#39;s free will.</p><p>---077---</p><p>Time died, everything was at peace, a quiet as comfortable as down. Sleep unconsciously used this happiness and relief, and the children knew that time was not enough to sleep, but they still could not rest. They thought that sleep was composed of six different squares and a huge chessboard. They stood in the middle of the chessboard, naked and trembling. There was a soldier who looked so big and looked at the approximate position of each piece. They saw that some of the chess pieces wore Song crowns, some had long hair, and each was huge and unusual.</p><p>---078---</p><p>Oh, my lolita, I was moved by her shameless smooth legs. Others broke my heart. You ruined my life. I was with poor widower Humbert Humbert, melting with her honey colored skin, tangled with her brown bobbed hair (though I don&#39;t like her big bright mouth)</p><p>---079---</p><p>I always felt left out. It was because they were all here to study, leaving me alone, and I was like a little cute kid in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;. I was the only one left muttering to myself.</p><p>---080---</p><p>Our existence is but a brief ray of light in the eternal darkness. Compared with the darkness we lived in before, we are more afraid of the darkness that we encounter in our first life.</p><p>---081---</p><p>But the night was full of twists and turns. I tried to force myself not to think about chess, but it was impossible. Although I felt sleepy, sleep could not find a way into my mind. Sleep was looking for a loophole in the brain to enter, but there was only one entrance guarded by a chess sentry. I felt the pain and sleep was coming to me, and I was close to it, and I knew that it was in my mind, and it could not come in. I was tired and wandering around in the room, and I woke up when I saw Luzhin shaking the chessboard in front of me, and this happened, but it was Luzhin&#39;s beautiful life.</p><p>Worse still—the kid won a big match, but it was even harder to learn the concept of chess, and even the first time she played well, she started to have an unpleasant split feeling. She played a game of chess for an hour, and after that she had a headache for no apparent reason. It wasn&#39;t the whole head that hurt, but only parts of it, like the black squares on the board hurt, but the white squares didn&#39;t.</p><p>---082---</p><p>The little boy hurried past with the flipping of books. Suddenly, the other boy stopped - stopped on a precious chessboard. It was the layout, the opening, a complete game of chess.</p><p>---083---</p><p>Each day in a year may belong to different happiest people, especially those who enjoy the sunshine it bestows, or complain about the rain it sprinkles. It is unknown who this good day is given to, and everyone is the lucky one who gets the gift. We are all kept in the dark and feel happy about it.</p><p>---084---</p><p>Although it is the brain that is used most when reading, the joy of appreciating art is part of the time that is on your shoulder blade. The slight tremor of his spine is the final form of emotional expression that humans have achieved in the process of developing pure art. It has given rise to our worship of our own spine and the excitement of the spine! We are vertebrates with a sacred fire burning in our heads, and the brain is just a continuation of the spine, like a wick running through the entire candle.</p><p>---085---</p><p>Childhood is the age when the soul&#39;s instincts are not right but tend to make mistakes.</p><p>---086---</p><p>Whether you live or die is something you can learn by looking at it.</p><p>I can’t give up watching. I don’t want to give up watching. Period.</p><p>---087---</p><p>This is my story and I have read it again. I have some bone marrow, blood and beautiful green flies stuck to it.</p><p>---088---</p><p>The devil only tempted the child like this, and then tried to stop the child from learning. However, I felt a vague pain deep down that this happened accidentally.</p><p>---089---</p><p>A certain man once lost a diamond cuff-link in the wide blue sea, and twenty years later, on the exact day, a Friday apparently, he was eating a large fish - but there was no diamond inside. That’s what I like about coincidence.</p><p>There was a man who took off a diamond bracelet and was blown away by the blue sea. Two girls were born in the same year, and they grew up together. They were also the fifth generation of the stars. They saw a big fish on the fish, but they didn&#39;t find diamonds in the fish&#39;s belly. I liked this coincidence that I met her.</p><p>---090---</p><p>The concept of the castle-like &quot;Valley of the Thousands of Graces&quot; that encompasses lust, imprisonment, sexual slavery and promiscuity must have inspired the idea of ​​David Bowie&#39;s recent short film Louis Vuitton L&#39;invitation au Voyage - Venetian. Even though the film uses a theme similar to masquerade to cover up the lewd and imaginary fantasy (especially the name of Nabokov&#39;s &quot;brilliant &amp; naked&quot; appears in Bowie&#39;s lyrics), it is obvious that the first person who reads Nabokov&#39;s fantasy-like text will instantly connect the two together.</p><p>---091---</p><p>I would like to mention here the collective literature of the Soviet Union. At the beginning, based on the idea of ​​communism, the supply of literature must exceed the demand, which led to the collective production of literature. Later, it became a factor of social instability and even destruction and subversion, and writers also suffered (even at the cost of their lives). European classical literature comes from the precious and dazzling legacy of great writers such as Dickens, Tolstoy and Gogol, and this kind of literature does not exist. Soviet writers would meet once a week or so at a writers&#39; group or in private to exchange ideas, criticize, and revise their stilted works, so that they would become more mature, more in line with the times, and more conducive to the country and the nation&#39;s appetite. These stupid writers never knew that maturity and conformity were the enemies of writing, and that stiltedness and originality were the most important parts of language that must be retained. In the meantime, writers never tire of changing their techniques or language styles, which do not necessarily conform to the times.</p><p>---092---</p><p>Everything in the world is beautiful, but Man only recognizes beauty if he sees it either seldom or from afar.</p><p>Because you only see beauty when you have learned everything, and therefore human beings can only recognize beauty when they have less or less time to look at it.</p><p>---093---</p><p>Perhaps this was the first time in my life that I had to ask myself the big question of my life - where did I go after I learned it?

During my graduate school career in the United States, I never gave a lecture without preparing a manuscript and never looked away from it when I spoke to the public at the brightly lit podium. I would speak in poor French when I was on the phone and switch from my English to poor French when I was on the phone. When I was at a party, I would stutter and stammer when I wanted to tell a funny story to entertain my friends. The overnight beast I described to my wife at the breakfast table was just a first draft.</p><p>---173---</p><p>It was bittersweet when I was conceiving a work; it was painfully irritating when I was struggling with my writing tools and writing materials—pencils that needed to be sharpened, cards that needed to be rewritten, bladders that needed to be emptied, words that needed to be checked for spelling errors. Then, I read the manuscript prepared by my secretary, corrected the mistakes made by me and my secretary, transcribed the corrected manuscript, corrected the wrong page numbers, and checked the text for deletions or additions. I repeated this process when I was proofreading. I opened the thick, beautiful book and found a stupid omission caused by my observation. Almost immediately, I got used to the final stage of the book, and the habit could wean me from it. I now look upon it with a curious tenderness, as a man looks upon a woman who is not his wife but his son.</p><p>---174---</p><p>In the dreams that recurred in my childhood, as soon as I saw a stain on the wallpaper or the whitewashed door, the nasty feeling would suddenly start to move.</p><p>---175---</p><p>The clues of the object are still there, and the clues are still there.

The Hungarian player kept playing, and he stayed up all night, looking pale, thinking hard about the chessboard. During this sleepless night, the young man had figured out all the moves, but they all ended in a draw, except for this one move that had a hidden meaning. Luzhin made a solemn move, and the young man wrote his move on a piece of paper. The Hungarian player wanted to lose quickly, so Luzhin decided to sit down and play against the Russian player.</p><p>---179---</p><p>What do you mean by that?

It means that my brother-in-law, who is a Party member, sits in his office with a large glass plate on his desk and helps me sort out my accounts in every possible way: I used to earn more than ten times that, but now we all belong to a happy society. Now we are all in one family - a huge family, all connected and like one family. Everyone in the Party has some relatives. My sister said that she could not regret it, because our work was gone, and she was afraid of bloodshed. It was not scary at all. I&#39;m telling you about that.

This origin seemed to provide a guarantee for his recent series of fantasies - a secret illegal adventure - so that they could also become reality and be realized in his life, just like his past dream of football had now become reality.</p><p>---205---</p><p>Even though I now know what to look for in the past, they still appear in my mind with no more than the benefit of exaggerating that thing.</p><p>---206---</p><p>At that time, Shen Ding began to guess that not only Sonya, but all the people they knew in common seemed to be avoiding him. No one needed him, and no one liked him. He went to visit Bubnohe&#39;s home. Bubnohe suddenly stared at him with strange eyes, asking for his forgiveness, and then he went out to continue writing. He felt that if he continued like this, he would become Sonya&#39;s shadow, wandering around on the main road of Berlin, and finally wasting the increasingly mature and solemn feeling in his heart on feelings. Finally, Shen Ding decided to leave Berlin and think about the adventure plan in the loneliness of clearing away the old thoughts.</p><p>---207---</p><p>I think like a genius, write like a good writer, and speak like an inarticulate person.</p><p>I answered the phone and the person I was talking to switched to poor French, using the English I was expecting.</p><p>The interviewer had to submit many of the questions in writing, and I had to write down my answers and keep them exactly the same when I published them.

Why do I write my books? For my own amusement and for the sake of enlightenment. My writing never has any social significance or moral message; I never have a general idea to explain, I just like to make up riddles that don&#39;t have elegant answers.</p><p>---209---</p><p>There was a thought that made Shen Ding feel uneasy: she might find the similarities between the small painting on the wall and the illustration in the book. She thought that she was worried about it and wanted to take the painting away to prevent her from getting lost at night. So, the next year, she would pray in bed before going to bed, either mumbling to herself quickly or kneeling on the pillow, praying to God to look for the moon. She found that the charming path was right above her head. At that time, looking back at the youth, he once wondered if he had jumped into the painting on that night, and if this experience was the starting point of his life journey filled with happiness and pain. He seemed to remember the cold chill, the green light, the winding path, the tree trunks that flashed past when he ran barefoot, and the strange dark night sky that limited his opportunities.</p><p>---210---</p><p>People don&#39;t say I&#39;m going to do an interview, if &quot;interview&quot; means a casual chat with a real person. I&#39;ve tried it a few times before. Once, someone used a tape recorder, and when the tape didn&#39;t play back, I quickly put it away and continued to use it. I realized that I really couldn&#39;t play this role again. Now, I am careful to make sure that when I interview someone, I don&#39;t have to be idle and let him have his way. The interviewer must submit many questions in writing, and I have to write down my answers and keep them exactly the same when I publish them. This has changed my feeling that I am a prerequisite for accepting interviews.</p><p>---211---</p><p>Then, at night, unable to fall asleep for a long time, thinking of the romantic encounter he had just had, thinking of all the girls who were waiting for him in the city at dawn, he would occasionally repeat the name of a woman - Isabel thought, Nina, Margarita - a name that was still cold and unrememberable, like an empty room full of echoes that no one had come to live in. He wondered which of these names would suddenly come to life for him, seem so strange and familiar, and he felt that he would never be able to say it like he felt now.</p><p>---212---</p><p>The details she recalled seemed almost too clear to her. It was said that this feeling was a kind of dramatic sensation enjoyed by a drowning person, especially one who had almost burst forth from the sea - a kind of suffocation, which she had suddenly discovered in her mind, and which she had forgotten the name of, but which she called the subconscious shock of baptism, which caused all those feelings between the first and last baptisms to burst forth at once, and she remembered them all.</p><p>---213---</p><p>Generally speaking, what can ignite the desire of young people are those distant images, taboos, ambiguous sounds and characters, but the portraits of people and things in Hamilton are the bulging little alumni&#39;s murmurs about &quot;red lights&quot;. As long as they are vague, they can mobilize young people&#39;s imagination in their eyes to look at the various details of the past people and objects.</p><p>---214---</p><p>Should you go back to Russia?</p><p>I don&#39;t really want to go back, but it can be said from the outside that everything I want to go back to Russia will eventually accompany me: the culture, the language, the people and my childhood in Russia. I will never go back. I will never surrender. In fact, the shadow of a police state will always be indelible in my life. I don&#39;t want to let you know my work anymore, but maybe there are some readers of mine. We often forget that in the past few years, Russia has become extremely narrow, not to mention telling people what to read and what to think.</p><p>---215---</p><p>I don&#39;t want to compare that article to this one, because if a critic makes such an interpretation, it means that he must have studied the emotions of millions of people in his country before reaching this conclusion. If this is the case, then I am indeed an outlier. On the contrary, if the research is limited to the research of friends, then the interpretation of the article must be seriously discussed.</p><p>---216---</p><p>Oh, when he was catching and studying butterflies. The pleasure and rewards of literary creation were nothing to the discovery of new butterfly organs under the microscope and the joy of finding new butterfly species in Iran or Peru. If the Russian Revolution had not happened, I would probably have devoted myself entirely to the study of lepidoptera and pterygium, and would not have had the time to write novels.</p><p>---217---</p><p>My life ambitions have so far exceeded the ambitions of my childhood and youth. In the first year of our century, on a long journey to Europe with my family, I lay in bed and imagined how we would sleep as a wanderer, under the eucalyptus trees of the national resort, thinking of distant, bleak, unconquerable Russia (this title seemed to me to be appropriate). Lenin and the young policeman made this fantasy come true. In the second year of my life, I dreamed of going to the Karakoram Mountains to look for butterflies. In the fifth year of my life, accompanied by my brave writer (see my novel &quot;Ode to Him&quot;), I successfully explored many regions of Central Asia with a net in hand. When I was five, I thought I was like that when I was seven, I was like that famous writer, with wavy white hair. Now he is actually bald.</p><p>---218---</p><p>Some of my characters are admittedly quite savage, despite my old indifference, and they will be treated as my own, like the sad monstrosities on the facade of a cathedral - the devil is there to show that she is there after the fact. In fact, I am a gentle, suave, cruel person.</p><p>---219---</p><p>Time is dead, everything is fine</p><p>---220---</p><p>The closed town swept away by the automobile has changed many of the old rules. ... The sealed car has become the private room of the middle class, the only room for adventurous young people, and the symbol of the old taboos that can be broken in their eyes by indulging in lust.</p><p>---221---</p><p>Things go badly, only the years go by, and the disappearance is also in the dark.</p><p>---222---</p><p>The five senses aroused that joy which was like a shower of rain that rolled up from below - everything was like rolling up towards me. I had already understood it all, and there was nothing left to remember.</p><p>---223---</p><p>Over the next few days, there were several distant thunderstorms—or perhaps just one distant storm that swept across the country with a clumsy leapfrog gait.</p><p>---224---</p><p>Beauty plus pity - this is the closest definition we can get to the essence of art. Where there is beauty, there is pity. The truth is simple: beauty is only a thing, and form disappears with the disappearance of the creature, just as it disappears with the death of the individual creature.</p><p>---225---</p><p>The best quality of a scholar is to be both artistic and scientific.</p><p>---226---</p><p>Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.</p><p>Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth.</p><p>Lo. Lee. Ta.</p><p>Lolita, my life is like light, my desire is like fire. My sin, my soul.</p><p>Lolita: The tip of the tongue is still up, and I can feel it moving. The upper palate is better than the lower one and it only falls on the teeth.</p><p>Luo, Li, Ta.</p><p>---227---</p><p>Tuxiangti finally decided to take a risk - a storm of music suddenly rose on the chessboard. In the storm, Luzhin persevered in searching for the subtle and clear note that he needed to make. Fortunately, when he made a move, he felt that it was amplified and strengthened, turning into thunder and lightning. Now everything on the chessboard seemed to be full of vitality, everything was focused on one idea, and the situation was getting more and more tense. If you capture a chess piece, the chessboard will be eliminated, and the situation will be temporarily relieved. He will start to turbulent. Luzhin&#39;s thoughts wandered in this strange and terrifying maze, and from time to time he met Tuxiangti&#39;s anxious thoughts. The two were looking for the same thing and felt that they would not make a sound.</p><p>The young man glanced at the chessboard for a while and felt an unprecedented tiredness, his brain seemed to shrink. But the chess pieces on the board suddenly showed pity, and they still grabbed the young man. There was only fear on this side, and there was only harmony and joy. So what else was there besides the chess player and the player? Only fog, an unknowable and shapeless fog...</p><p>---228---</p><p>Perhaps we are exploring with the next ten years, and we are exploring the important things in nature through the wisdom and freedom of the wind, just like exploring the tumors of gynecology and other animals.</p><p>---229---</p><p>We also feel that any deviation from the destiny that has been set for us is not only contrary to our own wishes but also immoral.</p>",545)]))}const f=t(n,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
