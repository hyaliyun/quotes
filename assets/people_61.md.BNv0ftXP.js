in particle physics old physics which at the time of its death was still alive dominated high energy physics through the 1960s and into the early 1970s and concerned itself with common particle physics phenomena new physics refers to the theory and experiment package concerned with rare phenomena such as the search for quarks while each theoretical framework had little to say about the other and was useless in the phenomenal world of its rival each was satisfactory in its own terms despite this pickering also outlined a process of magical transmutation where new theories are produced from

hole geometry in 1984 this work was also got published in proc r soc subsequently he concentrated on black hole astrophysics received his phd in 1985 and went to caltech as a rc tolman fellow major work in this period includes nucleosynthesis around black holes with prof wd arnett after a brief period at ictp trieste where he completed a few definitive work on the formation of shocks in

commission28 galaxies of international astronomical union iau 19942000 he is a lifemember of the iau and a member of the american astronomical societythe main focus of the research area of prof chakrabarti is the hydrodynamic and radiative properties of astrophysical flows around black holes and other compact objects he showed that the accreting matter must be transonic and should have standing oscillating and propagating shocks he and his collaborators studied many aspects of these flows and showed that the black hole accretion must have nonkeplerian component which plays a major role in deciding the observational properties he wrote the first monograph on theory of transonic astrophysical flows world scientific pub co singapore 1990 he has completed over 400 research articles and written or edited several books and conference volumes twenty one students have completed phd thesis under his supervision and several are currently working according to him the black hole astrophysics is basically the astrophysics of subkeplerian flows and cenbol the centrifugal pressure dominated boundary layer around black holes the oftcited work of chakrabarti and titarchuk astrophysical journal 1995 brings out the concept of twocomponent flows indeed more and more observational results which include the spectral and timing properties of all the black hole candidates generally support his view that black holes also have a dissipative region around it which is nonkepleriansandip k chakrabarti was the first scientist to suggest that the gamma ray bursts are the birth cry of black holes at his presentation in 1995 3rd hunsville alabama conference on gamma ray bursts recently scientists observed a conclusive evidence of this birth crywith his wife dr sonali chakrabarti a few papers were written on the evolution of the complex molecules during star formation with a couple of phd scholars they have been able to show that even simple amino acids and bases of dna molecules such an adenine could also formed the results of complex molecule formation depend on our knowledge of the reaction crosssections and pathways and thus their exact abundances are liable to be revisedprof chakrabartis interest took new turns with the foundation of a new space science related institute indian centre for space physics icsp of which he is the founding general secretary and also the head of all the academic activities there prof chakrabarti is involved in research works in several topics which range from very low frequency vlf studies of ionosphere planetary ring dynamics astrobiology xray data analysis testing and evaluation of payloads and developments of detectors for xray astronomy"},{"author":"Skid Roper","quote":"skid roper born richard

acoustic chamber music usually featuring an instrumental soloist he frequently wrote for soloists who played instruments previously neglected by composers such as the marimba tuba euphonium viola saxophone and bassoon much of the music he wrote during this period was influenced by jrr tolkiens the lord of the rings his musical language was eclectic ranging from nonserial atonality to tertian and modal harmonies frequently contrapuntal and had a high degree of metricrhythmic animation this musical language reflected his previous occupation as a commercial musician in jazz funk and rock genres however he had an abiding love for the music of gustav mahler and igor stravinsky which manifested itself in dark somber musical moodshis writing style began to change coinciding with his

solo played by jimmy page from the rock group led zeppelin and chamber symphony no 4 for saxophone and winds inspired by the music of the funk group tower of power this period of creativity fostered
