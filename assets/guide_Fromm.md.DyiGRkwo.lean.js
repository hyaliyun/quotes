The ability to concentrate is reflected in being able to treat yourself well alone, and this ability is a prerequisite for love. In addition, because we cannot regenerate ourselves, we can only connect ourselves with another person, who may be the savior of our life, but this kind of relationship is closely related to love.</p><p>---006---</p><p>If I love young people, I should feel at one with them, accept them as they are, not ask them to become the person I want them to be, so that I can treat them as I want them to be.</p><p>---007---</p><p>A person can, and should, see what he really wants to achieve, not feel safe, but be able to accept the reality of insecurity.</p><p>---008---</p><p>I have always believed that true love can awaken a certain kind of life in your heart that will never fade away, and can also awaken a certain kind of life in your heart that is more fulfilling than happiness.</p><p>---009---</p><p>Love is not first of all a relationship with a certain person; it is an attitude, a character tendency. This attitude and character tendency also determine a person&#39;s relationship with the whole group, not a relationship with a &quot;loved one&quot;. If a person loves only one person and is indifferent to the other person, then love is not love, but a symbiotic attachment or a self-conscious meaning after the fact.</p><p>---010---</p><p>The feeling of loneliness is the root of all anxiety.</p><p>---011---</p><p>The love that is exchanged for more than one thing makes people suspicious. This kind of love makes people feel painful: I feel that the love in my heart is for the sake of making my family happy, not out of my own will - in the final analysis, I am not the one who loves me, but the one who needs me.</p><p>---012---</p><p>Love is the only thing that can be learned in nature. We can learn to accept more happily, and we cannot accept it because it is a kind of inner deprivation. We cannot accept it because it expresses the existence of our life in the process of learning. It is in the process of learning that I experience my abundance, my wealth, my ability. -</p><p>---013---</p><p>Respect means that one should pay attention to the growth and performance of the other person according to his or her own nature. In the outside world, respect also means that one cannot dominate others. I hope that the person I love in my heart will grow and perform in his or her own way and for his or her own sake, and not just serve me. If I love someone, I feel that I am one with him or her, and that he or she is still me, and that he or she is not just the one I want, but the one who is my master. Only when I have achieved my own independence, when I can stand up without crutches, when I can be independent in many ways, and when I don&#39;t want to dominate and dominate others, then respect for others is possible. Only on the basis of freedom can there be love.</p><p>---014---</p><p>You must spend time to make sure that the person you are with is the right one for you. In the outside world, love and faith are essentially a feeling that cannot be separated from a person&#39;s maturity. It is not just a feeling that you need to invest your heart into. It includes not only emotional elements, but also natural and neutral elements. In addition to the innate part, people and the environment should experience, develop habits, comprehend, practice, and figure out whether they have the ability to love. First, you need to assess whether you have the ability to love someone. If you have experienced enough, you are qualified to talk about love.</p><p>---015---</p><p>People tend to take this infatuation as evidence of a strong love, but in fact it only shows how lonely, isolated, and miserable these men and women were before.</p><p>---016---</p><p>In the hearts of mature people, we can see a series of different attitudes: mature people can creatively give full play to their potential; mature people only want to get the fruits of their labor; mature people abandon the narcissistic fantasy of omniscience and omnipotence; mature people have achieved a kind of humility based on their own potential. This potential can only be given by positive creative energy.</p><p>---017---</p><p>Love is not an innate ability. It is an ability that needs to be acquired through practice.</p><p>If you can&#39;t love others with humility, courage, honesty and discipline,</p><p>If people only take advantage of the situation, they will never be able to gain satisfaction in their love life.</p><p>---018---</p><p>Faith in nature refers to belief in a non-natural authority. Faith in nature is a firm belief rooted in one&#39;s own thoughts or emotional experiences.</p><p>---019---</p><p>At this time, modern people often feel an illusion as follows: young people seem to be able to understand what they are pursuing, and what they pursue in terms of personality and things is nothing more than what others expect them to pursue.</p><p>---020---</p><p>Loving others and loving yourself are not two-or-the-less choices. On the contrary, in all those who love others more than they love, we can find the attitude of self-love. Love, in principle, can be felt as &quot;beings&quot; separated from oneself. True love is a creative expression, including care, respect, responsibility and understanding. Love is not a driven emotion in the heart, but a positive desire for the development and happiness of the loved one; the basis of this pursuit is the ability of the person to love himself.</p><p>---021---</p><p>In sex, two persons become one, while in love, two persons who were one are now separated. Love should not only tolerate this separation, but should also want to support it. It is at this stage that love becomes a difficult task, and love seeks only for the sake of selflessness, devoting everything to seeking only the happiness of the lover in mind. It is also at this stage that many lovers realize that they have failed and are unable to complete their love tasks.</p><p>---022---</p><p>Love is an active concern for the life and growth of the loved one. If this active concern is lacking, there is no love at all.</p><p>---023---</p><p>Love is a spontaneous response, not a spontaneous emotion. It is a kind of &quot;self-sufficiency&quot;. Generally speaking, the origin of love can be described as a kind of giving, not taking.</p><p>---024---</p><p>We can find narcissistic elements in love. Love is the only way to see your child as part of your heart, so love and obsession with your child may be a manifestation of narcissism.</p><p>---025---</p><p>The price of freedom is the loss of a sense of security.</p><p>---026---</p><p>Now let us assume that people are people, and that the relationship between people is a human relationship. Then you can only exchange love for love, faith for faith, and so on. If you want to enjoy art, you must be a person with artistic accomplishment. If you want to influence people, you must be a person who can actually inspire and push people forward. All your relationships with people and yourself must be the true and certain expression of your current personal life and in accordance with your will. If you are in love, you cannot arouse the love of your partner, that is, if your love as love cannot make your partner produce corresponding love, if your life expression as a lover cannot make you become the person you love in your heart, then your love is excessive, which is unfortunate.</p><p>---027---</p><p>In order to overcome the feeling of loneliness and inability, the individual develops an impulse to abandon his individuality, to dissolve himself completely into the earth. These impulses and the new ties that arise from them are not necessarily cut off from the process of self-growth. Just as the child cannot physically return to the womb, so the process of individuation cannot be repeated physically. Such an attempt necessarily leads to a kind of irreconcilable phenomenon, in which the basic conflict between authority and the child who is subject to it cannot be eliminated. The child may feel safe and satisfied consciously, but it will disappear unconsciously, and the price he will realize is the abandonment of his own excess and self-completeness. From the outside, the result of submission is the opposite: it not only exacerbates the child&#39;s insecurity, but also creates hostility and rebelliousness.</p><p>---028---</p><p>A man I know loves nothing.</p><p>A person who can do nothing knows nothing.</p><p>People who know nothing are of no value.</p><p>A person who understands the outside world and can love naturally is a person who can understand the outside world and can love naturally.</p><p>Have insight, have a little light...</p><p>The deeper you understand a thing,</p><p>The degree of love is deeper.</p><p>If someone thinks,</p><p>All the true small fruits ripen together with the strawberries,</p><p>The only thing we know about the grapes is that they were grown there that year.</p><p>---029---</p><p>But in essence, love is an art about the will of life, an art of committing one life to another with a complete life.</p><p>---030---</p><p>Responsibility, in its true sense, is a completely voluntary request; responsibility is my response to the expressed or unexpressed needs of another being. &quot;Responsible&quot; means that I have the ability to respond to these needs more than I am prepared to do so.</p><p>---031---</p><p>Love is a positive attitude in the human heart. This attitude can break through the barriers between people and bring people together. Love can help people overcome loneliness and alienation, while at the same time allowing people to maintain their individuality and the integrity of their hearts. In love, there often appears the following paradoxical form: two lives become one, while others still retain their individual dignity and individuality.</p><p>---032---</p><p>There are many levels of understanding; understanding as an element of love is to see into the core of people and things, not just the surface. To reach this level of understanding, we can only transcend our own focus and move towards the true nature of the world.</p><p>---033---</p><p>In the energy of learning, the young people enrich themselves; by improving their sense of life, the young people also improve their sense of life. The use of energy is not to get energy from others; energy is a kind of pleasure. In the energy of learning, it is inevitable that the image will awaken certain sounds in the heart, and these awakened sounds will return to the young people&#39;s own heart; in the real energy, the young people can&#39;t help but accept some of the sounds that can return to the heart and the next.</p><p>---034---</p><p>Humans are animals that like to escape from freedom. There is a psychological problem called &quot;choice dilemma&quot; that arises naturally. People are afraid of making choices. There are ten reasons for this: externally, they are anxious about taking responsibility for their choices; externally, they are worried about giving up another choice later.</p><p>---035---</p><p>The ability to love as a skill depends much on the development of one&#39;s own character. It presupposes a creative tendency on the part of the person to achieve a kind of possession and to exercise his or her own will. In this tendency, the person must overcome the dependency, narcissism and desire to dominate, the desire to exploit the person, and even the desire to be stingy; have confidence in the person&#39;s own personal vision, and have the courage to achieve his or her goal with his or her own vision. If the person lacks these qualities to some extent, then the person will be afraid to give of himself or herself - and therefore afraid to love.</p><p>---036---</p><p>Modern people are living in illusions, thinking they know what they want to do, but in fact they are just trying to get what they want. To make everyone accept this, they must realize that it is not as easy as many people think, and getting ahead is the biggest problem that people must solve.</p><p>---037---</p><p>Paradoxically, the ability to be alone is the condition for the ability to love.</p><p>Paradoxically, the ability to be alone determines the ability to be in love.</p><p>---038---</p><p>In this case, it&#39;s not strange why some people go crazy, but why so many people go crazy.</p><p>---039---</p><p>What can a person learn from others? You can give away the most precious thing you have, your life. This does not necessarily mean that you must sacrifice your life for others, but that you should give away the things you have in your life. You should share your joy, interests, insights, knowledge, humor and sorrow with others - in short, everything you have in your life.</p><p>---040---</p><p>In a love relationship, only a person who is completely awake can not feel bored or make others bored. In fact, this is the natural thing of love, and not feeling bored or making others bored is also the natural thing of love.</p><p>---041---</p><p>The task we must set for ourselves is not to feel secure, but to be able to tolerate insecurity.</p><p>The goal we must set for ourselves is not to have a sense of security, but to be able to tolerate insecurity.</p><p>---042---</p><p>Only on the basis of freedom can people have love.</p><p>---043---</p><p>Although everyone has certain needs, such as hunger, thirst, and sex, it is the impulses that make people different, such as love and hate, the desire for power, the desire for submission, and the addiction to or fear of sensual pleasures, that are the products of social tendencies. Human inclinations, the best or the worst, are not fixed biological parts of human nature, but are the products of the social tendencies that create people. In other words, social tendencies are not only repressive, but also creative. Human nature, passions, and anxieties are also cultural products; in fact, human nature is the most important thing in the continuous struggle of mankind to create and achieve things, and its records are called history.</p><p>---044---</p><p>We are a mystery to ourselves, just as the moon is a mystery to us. The only way to full knowledge is through love: love is beyond thought, beyond language. Love is a bold commitment to the experience of integration. Openness is the best knowledge that thought can give, that is, the knowledge that comes naturally from the heart, and it is also a necessary condition for full knowledge in love. In order to be able to see the reality of life, or to overcome illusions and distort our impressions of life, we must objectively understand life and myself. Only when we objectively understand ourselves can we understand life in its ultimate essence, in love.</p><p>---045---</p><p>This community will eventually become a community with its own personality, vitality and love.</p><p>---046---</p><p>Escaping from freedom cannot restore people&#39;s lost sense of security, but can only help them forget that they are independent individuals. They sacrifice the integrity of their own self, and what they get is only a fragile sense of security.</p><p>---047---</p><p>If a person&#39;s personality has not yet been unique when he is young, he may lack some necessities for growth, such as a book, a piece of clothing, a unique space, a sense of security, or love. Then he should spend his whole life exploring and searching, regardless of the cost and consequences.</p><p>---048---</p><p>Loving someone is not only a strong feeling, but also a decision, a judgment, and a promise. If love is just a feeling, then there is no basis for the promise to love each other for a lifetime. When a feeling comes, it must be ready to leave. If my love does not contain the spirit of judgment and decision, how can I be sure of the long-lasting love?</p><p>---049---</p><p>Immature love is: &quot;I love you, but in the outside world I still say that I need you.&quot; Mature love is: &quot;I need you, but in the outside world I still say that I love you.&quot;</p><p>---050---</p><p>All human passions (both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;) are external and they make us want to make life meaningful. We must find a new way for us, a way to inspire the passion that &quot;promotes life&quot;, a way to make us feel that life is more important than ever before, more complete than ever before, more meaningful than ever before. This is the only way. Otherwise, you can never tame us, but you can never cure us.</p><p>---051---</p><p>The role of talents is to give children a sense of security in life, while the main function of talents is to guide children to face up to the various difficulties they encounter in their later years.</p><p>A good person should not stop his growth or encourage his children. A good person should believe in life, not be anxious and spread this emotion to his children. He should hope that his children will eventually break away from him.</p><p>A government should be governed by certain principles and should seek certain benefits. It should be tolerant and patient, not aggressive and overbearing. A government should make children have more and more confidence in themselves and their abilities, and ultimately make them their own masters, and eventually be able to break away from the authority of the government.</p><p>---052---</p><p>Respecting life, respecting young people and respecting one&#39;s own life are the accompaniments of the journey of life and an essential condition for mental health.</p><p>---053---</p><p>The deeper the understanding, the deeper the love.</p><p>---054---</p><p>The yardstick of love: We must objectively look at ourselves to get to know ourselves and our partner again, so that we can see the real state of our partner in the image of ourselves, or overcome our own fantasies, or use this as a tool to overcome the distorted image of our partner in our hearts. Only when we objectively look at ourselves to get to know a person again, can we understand the true nature of our partner in love.</p><p>---055---</p><p>Self-love and self-love are by no means mutually exclusive, but in fact contradictory. A self-loving person does not love himself too much, but rather does not love himself enough. Lack of love and concern for oneself indicates that the person lacks life at heart, which often makes him feel empty and hopeless. When things go wrong, this unfortunate and timid person will try to make up for his lack of happiness through various other satisfactions. He seems to care about himself very little, but in fact he is just trying to cover up and make up for his lack of love by caring about himself.</p><p>---056---</p><p>Love is to treat a person as an independent person and to respect him/herself so that we can recognize his/her unique personality. Respect means to help him/her grow and develop. I hope that the person I love will take his/her own style as the basis for his/her future growth and development, and not to cater to me. Respect is built on the basis of freedom. As an old French song says: &quot;Love is the product of freedom, not the product of domination.&quot;</p><p>---057---</p><p>If I do love someone, I also love the person who loves me, and I love him/her as well. If I can say to someone, &quot;I love you,&quot; I should also be able to say, &quot;I love everyone in my heart, and I love myself as well.&quot;</p><p>---058---</p><p>The essence of love is giving rather than acquiring.</p><p>---059---</p><p>The state of love is like this: if young men find the right partner, they will be confident and feel that they have the upper hand. At this time, young men will tend to be kind and gentle to their partners. After a period of time, if the wife does not really meet their expectations, conflicts and frictions will arise.</p><p>---060---</p><p>A miser who is afraid of loss is not a miser. No matter how much property he has, from a certain perspective, he is just a poor and pitiful person.</p><p>---061---</p><p>——Love is a natural movement, not a kind of emotional emotion. It is &quot;sharing&quot;, not &quot;falling&quot;. In a general sense, the natural movement of love can be explained as follows: love is first of all the ability to give, not to accept.</p><p>---062---</p><p>The process of individualization is a process of increasing self-esteem and improving personal personality. It is also a process of mutual understanding and commonality. It involves the process of increasing separation between children and adults. This increasing separation may lead to loneliness, anxiety and insecurity. If children can develop their own self-esteem and creative self-esteem, they may also establish a new close relationship with adults. Developing self-esteem and creative self-esteem is also a prerequisite for establishing a new relationship.</p><p>---063---</p><p>The author talks about the art of love: the author says that although he does not represent himself, he represents the extreme of human existence in the world: that is, he represents the way of thought, the laws, order and discipline created by man to establish the way of man and things. The author says that it is the way of education, and things also point out that there are many kinds of people.</p><p>---064---</p><p>Respecting animals means focusing on their own interests rather than allowing them to grow and develop freely according to their own personalities.</p><p>---065---</p><p>We can give an example to illustrate this. Some people work with enthusiasm because of extreme mental restlessness or loneliness, while others work for promotion and wealth. In this case, this person is a slave to enthusiasm, a passion, and the &quot;positivity&quot; of the upward spirit is actually a &quot;passivity&quot;, which is also seen as being driven by society. He is a suffering person, not a &quot;motivated&quot; person. On the other hand, people tend to regard a person who sits in a chair and meditates, observes and experiences himself and his relationships as &quot;passive&quot;, and also sees as &quot;doing nothing&quot;. In fact, this kind of highly concentrated meditation is the most active, the positivity of the soul, which can only be truly understood by those who are free and alone.</p><p>---066---</p><p>Love is a power which produces love.</p><p>Love is an eye-to-eye relationship that produces an excess of love.</p><p>---067---</p><p>Love is unquestionable.

The word respect comes from the idea that there is a way to look at people more than people, to stand up for themselves, to face their own unique personality and to recognize their own unique personality. Respecting people is the only way to make them grow and develop themselves, and this respect can never be exploited. I hope that the person I love in my heart will grow and develop in their own way and for their own sake, and not serve me. If I love young people, I should feel at one with them, to look up to them and accept them as they are, to look up to them and not just to make them become the next person I hope for, so that I can use them as my own. Only when I feel that I am alone and have the support of others can I gain my own advantages, that is, I don&#39;t want to control and dominate others.

Modern capitalism naturally requires people who can feel free and independent and believe that they are not subject to authority, principles and conscience, and who are ready to follow orders, complete tasks that can be learned, and work obediently into the machine, obeying orders, willingly obeying leaders, and blindly following orders - there is only one case that will happen, and they will do everything they can to play their role and compete for promotion.</p><p>---102---</p><p>Just as the nature of the economic system determines a person&#39;s life pattern, the life pattern of the person becomes the primary factor that determines the entire personality structure.

the contrary, if the child is cold, callous, or tyrannical, he or she will shift the need for love to the child, and develop into a single-minded person. This person will only obey the principles of law, order, and authority, and will naturally have the ability to establish himself or herself more than he or she hopes or gets love. If the child is authoritative and has a close relationship with others, this development will be strengthened. Other studies have also come to the following conclusions: some forms of beating, such as compulsive beating, are related to the patient&#39;s single behavior, while other beating symptoms, such as twitching, alcoholism, inability to face the present, and aversion to reality, are caused by the patient&#39;s single behavior.</p><p>---179---</p><p>If the union in the first place is not based on love, if sexual love does not have the element of universal love, then it will only create a temporary union in the first place. Sexual attraction is more than just a momentary illusion of union. However, if there is no love at all, only a strange feeling will remain in this union, and the distance between the two will not be reduced immediately. The two are still strangers, and they do not feel ashamed or hate each other. In fact, they feel this strange feeling more strongly when the illusion disappears.</p><p>---180---</p><p>As they get to know each other, the trust between them grows more and more, miraculously, until the distance, the desire and the chat wipe out the remaining charm. When they come out, they don&#39;t think of this.

It is not a question of whether they can stand up and face the person they love more than they do when they are in love. For young people, the key is: Can I make the person I love in my heart? Can the person I love be worthy of the person I love in my heart?</p><p>---182---</p><p>Love is not first of all a relationship with a particular person, it is more of an attitude, a kind of character tendency.

Generally speaking, it can be expressed in another way, that is, love is first of all a learning, not a loss.</p><p>---184---</p><p>If a person is driven by positive emotions, he is free and is naturally emotional.

These human atoms are independent of each other, and they can also play their own role when they are gathered together. They all obey the same command. Despite this, they are all convinced that they are doing things according to their own wishes. Things require standardization of products in modern large-scale production, and the development of society also requires the &quot;standardization&quot; of people, which is called &quot;things&quot;.</p><p>---187---</p><p>We can say that in principle I and another person can feel that they are the objects of my love. I can affirm my own life, happiness, development and freedom only because I have the most basic state of appreciation and ability required for such affirmation.

If he can only &quot;love&quot; other people, then he has no ability to love at all.</p><p>---188---</p><p>As a member of the labor force, people are just a number.

The opposites of yin and yang are also reflected in the hearts of men and women.

They also have the principles of acceptance and penetration, the insemination of matter and essence. Men and women can only find the unity of the heart in the union of yin and yang.

One does not know how to adapt to this kind of situation. So one begins to doubt oneself, the meaning of life, and finally, the very principle of life. Dependence and doubt paralyze life; in order to survive, one tries to escape from freedom. People will inevitably be put into new shackles. This kind of shackles is different from the original constraints. The original constraints can only give people a sense of security. Escaping from freedom cannot make people regain the lost sense of security. It can only help people forget that they are independent individuals. They sacrifice the integrity of their own self, and what they get is only a fragile sense of security. It is also said that people cannot stand the taste of loneliness, and they would rather give up themselves. Therefore, freedom will put people&#39;s true self into new shackles. &quot;</p><p>---197---</p><p>Positive freedom is the expression of one&#39;s self, which means fully affirming one&#39;s unique personality.</p><p>---198---</p><p>The opposite of symbiotic union is mature love, which is to merge with the young while preserving one&#39;s own integrity and uniqueness, or to maintain one&#39;s own individuality. Human love is a positive emotion that can break through the barriers between people and also help people unite. Love can help people overcome loneliness and isolation, while at the same time making people remain loyal to themselves, maintain their integrity and original appearance.</p><p>---199---</p><p>Love is

People with a basically non-creative personality structure tend to have a feeling that they have gained something. Therefore, most people of this type reject learning. Some people tend to regard &quot;learning&quot; as a virtue of self-sacrifice. Young people think that &quot;learning&quot; is painful, so they should not do so. The virtue of learning is to be prepared to sacrifice. For young people, the principle of &quot;learning&quot; means that they would rather endure losses than experience happiness.</p><p>Creative people have a completely different understanding of &quot;learning&quot;.

The love that we can see in animals, or more precisely, the kind of love that animals have in their hearts, is not a kind of love that can be expressed in nature. It is part of the instinct of animals. In humans, we can only see the remnants of this instinct. The fundamental point of human existence is that humans have transcended animals, transcended instinctive adaptability, and separated themselves from others - although humans cannot completely separate themselves from others. Humans continue to be a part of themselves, and they must be separated from themselves, and they cannot truly merge with themselves. Humans can only achieve a harmonious state with themselves in their hearts, and there is no way that animals can block their return.

What I mean by universal love is a sense of responsibility for all people, caring, respecting and understanding them, and being willing to make suggestions for their lives.
