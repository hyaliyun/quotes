maestro del acordeon y sus polkas on urbana records and received his first grammy nomination for best polka album for the 51st annual grammyschicanos mexicanamericans have always been prolific music makers they have been the music trendsetters among mexicans in the southwest throughout most of the 20th century in fact beginning in the 1930s the texasmexicans created the two most powerful regional styles ever to emerge among mexicans anywhere orquesta and conjuntothe best of the conjuntos is beyond a doubt el conjunto bernal described by connoisseurs of conjunto music as the only one of its kind and twenty years ahead of its time el conjunto bernal is well known for its tremendous range of innovations its musical experiments spanned the gamut of conjunto from the traditional polka to latin music such as the bolero cha cha cha and even american rock and roll el conjunto bernal owed much of its originality and meteoric rise to fame to the genius of its founder paulino bernalpaulino bernal was born june 22 1939 in raymondville texas reared in the grinding poverty that was experienced by most chicanos of his generation paulino was forced to give up schooling when he was in the seventh grade an accomplished accordionist by that time he left school to try and earn money and get us out of the poverty in which we found ourselvesbernals mother was a divorcee and early on she moved to kingsville texas where paulino his older brother eloy the younger luis and three sisters were all forced to pick cotton cucumbers and other crops to help support the family one day a man came by the house selling a guitar and mrs bernal with great sacrifice bought it for the boys paulino soon learned enough to play the cantinas with an elderly accordionist where he picked up tips to help buy food for the bernal familybut paulinos future lay with the accordion he remembers hearing the best accordionists of the late 1940s and early 1950s on the radio narciso martinez valerio longoria tony de la rosa all of whom were recording for the largest mexicanamerican company at the time ideal records paulino dreamed of joining their ranks and when a friend of his was given an accordion as a gift it was paulino who spent the most time practising on it shortly afterwards during a trip to visit his father in rio grande valley eloy was given a bajo sexto by him and the bernals were soon ontrack toward their futurelos hermanitos bernal launched their musical career in 1952 they were hired to play a dance in nearby premont paulino on accordion eloy on bajo sexto and a friend adan lomas on drums according to bernal a lot of people attended and they liked the bernal brothers so much they kept calling us back they began playing in falfurrias and in alice nearby the home of ideal records soon the bernal brothers came to the attention of armando marroquin the man who recorded all the artists for ideal recordsthe bernal brothers were first recorded as the backup conjunto for some of the duets then popular among texasmexicans such as carmen y laura in march 1955 marroquin gave the bernals their chance as headliners and a 78 rpm record was released with the cancion ranchera mujer paseada on one side and the romantic bolero desprecio on the other with the release of their first record the bernal brothers quickly put their cotton picking days behind them forever and soon joined valerio longoria and tony de la rosa as the top conjuntos in texasel conjunto bernal recorded prolifically for ideal between 1955 and 1960 and some of the best sides including the monster hits mi unico camino and sentimiento y renco both from late 1958 are on this cd and cassettemarroquin began taking them on tours throughout the southwest and beyond where they always played for packed houses they were especially popular in arizona where local bandleader pedro bugarin was fond of featuring them with his orchestra in fact according to paulino he and eloy used to sit in with bugarins band and some of the band musicians would in turn sit in with el conjunto bernal this exposure to band music inspired paulino to branch out of the normally simple ranchera music of the conjunto into the more sophisticated style of the orquestawhen armando marroquin ended his relationship with ideal records around 1960 el conjunto bernal stayed with him and recorded for his new label nopal records shortly thereafter conjunto bernal relocated to mcallen texas across the border from mexico in the lower rio grande valley bernal began working with victor gonzales and the two men founded bego records the company name a combination of their two last names the bego years represent some of conjunto bernals most innovative work it was at his time that paulino attracted the most talented musicians in the conjunto traditions to his groupin the late 1960s gonzales bought out paulinos interest in bego records and paulino went on to found bernal records which also produced many outstanding hits by el conjunto bernal by this time however paulino had given up performing in favor of the administrative aspects of show business he ran the recording company hosted a regional tv music show and generally concentrated on the promotional aspects of the business meanwhile oscar hernandez and other very able accordionists picked up the slack and carried on the tradition of excellence begun by paulino during this same time success in the music field took its toll on paulino and he succumbed to the allure of alcohol and drugsin 1972 however a cook paulino had hired to work in a restaurant he owned changed his life by converting him to the teachings of bornagain christianity from that day on paulino gave up the life of alcohol and drugs to devote himself to preaching he also resumed his career as accordionist only this time he did so in the service of christianity he started a new recording company bernal christian records under whose banner he has continued to develop his inimitable style as he once commented in an interview people who knew me before lament that im not playing anymore they dont seem to realize that i play more now than i ever

editionhe traveled widely and wrote more in costa rica europe and china leading to the publication of his second book of poems needle man in 1999 with brickhouse books press acupuncture was a principal focus in this workhe was soon promoted through the ranks at providence college as a result primarily of his poetry and translations in fact an esteemed colleague rodney delasanta by this time a nationally reputed chaucerian convinced his colleagues on the rank and tenure committee that the publication of a single exceptional poem was worth ten good scholarly articlesuntil this time his poetry had focused on family and social issues its style lyrical and occasionally narrative the election of george w bush to the us presidency in the fall of 2000 however followed by the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 drastically changed mccrories outlook his whole political and literary orientation concerned with dramatizing essential american values he began a story in verse called washingtons night depicting the psychological political and military pressures on george washington in december 1776 and culminating in his victory at the battle of trenton on december 26 america the poem makes clear stresses not only military power but the longing for political freedom and especially a fundamental fairness the justice for which the nation has become famoushe was greatly helped in all this by his second marriage beatrice beebe whose work in new york city had explored motherinfant communication and whose psychoanalytic practice had established her firmly in that field was galvanized like her husband by the events of september 11 her struggle to help the mothers and children who had lost their men that day would prove invaluable to her patients and in time to mccroriebut first after a tenyear effort assisted by many greek scholars notably william wyatt of brown university he published a verse translation of homers odyssey with the johns hopkins university press in 2004 in all his translations he persisted with the idea of close approximation not only the sense but the sound of homers greek he attempted to capture in english verse responses to this work were highly favorable he would soon go on to homers iliadbefore then the death of his mother prompted a number of poems in mccrories next book published in 2010 by brickhouse books and called gone games childhood play also connects to this title as do romances that come and go in ones adult lifein the same year mccrorie published his first chapbook gretchen with brickhouse books and his first ebook with amazon by the same title for some time he had been working on a story in verse called focusing on the life and political vision of woodrow wilson gretchen schreiber a germanamerican character in this story suffers exceedingly when the u s following wilson goes to war with germany in 1917 generally wilson will try to treat germany fairly at the end of the war however indeed mccrories principal aim in the story is to explore the question how shall america send her best abroad no president before wilson had worked so hard trying to embody an answer to this question his league of nations was a crowning achievement in paris 1919on september 11 2011 beatrice beebe and other psychotherapists celebrated the tenth anniversary of their work with mothers and children who had lost their men in the world trade center attacks they published in the journal of infant child and adolescent psychotherapy their primary prevention project profoundly moved by some of these chapters mccrorie began a series of pretend ballads that book was published in three separate editions by the international psychoanalytic press in september 2014in the fall of 2012 mccrorie had published his translation of homers iliad with the johns hopkins university press again the translators aim was to approximate closely the meaning and music of the original especially since the very word for poet in homers greek is aeidos singer he has often presented the work to appreciative audiences especially at brown university and the translation has been highly recommended in reviews his preface announces the possibility of a book on the homeric tradition in epic down to the present day especially in the work of derek walcottthe crisis of 2008 during which american and world economies floundered had also turned mccrories attention to the hebrew bible after reading harold blooms essay in which the author concluded that an english translation of the psalms probably could not be faithful to the hebrew and graceful as english both mccrorie found himself powerfully drawn to the prophecy of jeremiah here was a work which warned of disaster for the jews in the sixth century bce and in mccrories mind portended extreme danger for his own peopletranslating jeremiah then became a workinprogress he finished a first draft after four years and with help from jewish friends like catherine hiller and retired rabbi david kline himself a translator of genesis mccrorie anticipated completion of the final draft in 2015by this time politicians scientists and ordinary families worldwide had become disturbedsome even despairing about the earths climate changing among the many persons and sources mccrorie consulted three women writers stood out gabrielle walker elizabeth kolbert and adrian klein explained past evidence and exposed present dangers in air and sea temperature levels of carbon dioxide and the likely causes including degradation by humans now with a fairly good picture of homo sapiens advancement over the past 200000 years often at the cost of many species extinction all the poet can do besides trying to shrink
