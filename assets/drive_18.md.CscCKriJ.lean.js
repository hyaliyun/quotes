I did not have book role models, I had book blueprints.But there remained a huge gap between the person I wanted to be and the person who I was. This was because no matter how many book blueprints I had, as much as I wanted to make myself the hero of my own life, it didnt matter as long as I kept telling the story wrong.Nowadays, as a storyteller, I know what the problem was. I had all the elements I needed to tell a good story. But I was telling it the wrong way, so I could never get to the ending I wanted.If you tell yourself youre a winner, you know what kind of story youre telling, and you will march toward that... Likewise, if you tell yourself youre a loser, youve made that your story, and you will march toward that instead. The same setbacks could happen in the losers story as in the winners story, but the self-defined loser would let them be proof that they were never going to be anything.Heres the story I was telling myself back when I was little edible child waiting to be carried away by hawks and making OCD rituals for herself: once upon a time, there was a girl who was afraid of everything. When I was 16, I realized that I knew what this story looked like and how it ended, and it wasnt the life I wanted for myself. If I wanted my ending to look different, I needed to change the kind of story I was telling about myself. I needed to shape my events into a different genre: once upon a time, there was a woman who was afraid of nothing. At age 16, I legally changed my name from my birthname  Heidi  to one I thought sounded like the hero I wanted to be: Maggie. And I vowed that I would never be afraid of anything ever again.Did it work? No, of course not. Not right away.

In the same survey only about one-third claim to feel engaged with their work. You can see the effects of this in absence, stress and depression. In fact, you can see it in the rush hour in the tired and sad-looking faces of so many commuters.The majority of people I coach are unhappy or dissatisfied with their working lives. They describe their work in so many depressing ways C as boring, tedious, mind-numbing, stressful, painful or even scary.

In your account you have just 100 dollars and He is asking you to execute a 400 million dollar project. Have you reached to the point that you consider going further will make no sense? Have you reached the point where you asked God are you sure you are still with me?I just found myself in that Junction now. Turning back ....to realise I have gone too far for Him to forsake me. Moving forward I heard the voice saying ...be still and know that I am your God. Giving up.....Couldn't find it in my dictionary.Moral of the lesson. God cannot give you an assignment that is equal to your pocket. If it suits your pocket it is definitely not from God. Remember God will not take glory where nothing happen.","author":"Patience Johnson, Why Does an Orderly God Allow Disorder","category":"creativity, depression, destiny, dream, dreams, earning, endtime, family, fantasy, feminism, fiction-food-for-though, forgiveness, freedom, friends, friendship, future, grief, heart, history, humanity-humour, imagination, inspirational-quotes, intelligence-is-attractive, joy, leadership, life-and-living-life-philosophy, life-quotes, literature, living, loss, love-quotes, magic-spirit, marriage, meditation-men, mind, money, motivation, motivational, motivational-quotes, music, nature, pain, passion-peace, patience, patience-johnson, pentecost, people, politics, positive-thinking, power, prayer, psychology, purpose, quote, quotes, reading, reality-relationship, repentance, sadness, self-help, self-improvement, society, soul, spiritual, strength, time, trust-war, wisdom-quotes, women, words, work, world"},{"quote":"God's word will produce with your level of understanding.

It plucks your heart out of your chest cavity and throws it into the skies where all you can do is watch it freefall towards the object of your love, and hope he or she would catch it. And very often your heart would land with a sordid, painful thud on the ground, or worse, a ditch, and lie there forlorn, neglected and pitiful until you found it, picked it up, glued the various parts back together and put it back into your chest where it would continue to beat on, stolidly, with only you knowing that there was a beat missing. A beat audible to no discerning ear, but your own, a slight sense of being out of tune with yourself, a heart that beat reluctantly, for the sake of keeping up appearances, in the forlorn hope that some day it would get back in rhythm, that some day it would have something to beat for. And then, over the years of missing a beat, you would grown irretrievably out of beat with yourself, and end up discordant.","author":"Kiran Manral, The Face at the Window","category":"heartbreak-quotes, love-quotes"},{"quote":"Ive been the queen of symmetry and everything had to be in identical balance, no matter how you looked at it.

Love is inexplicable; it is part poetry and part masochism. Part of love is the loss of self-control because one must openly surrender their sense of an exclusive self to the manic powers of love. The personal act of surrender to a lover leaves one vulnerable to entanglement in a maze of emotions. When we fall in love, our lovers happiness and well-being assumes the primary role in our mind, they become copilots of our souls. When we are in love for the first time, we feel what it means to become a complete person; we identify who we are by seeing our reflection in our lovers eye; and we sense what we might become when infused with love. When our lover leaves us, we feel vexed and vacant because we recognize that they took up such a large part of what made us feel intoxicated with life. When our lover abandons us, we lose our sense of self; we temporarily cease to exist as a whole person, and we must reconstruct the shattered remnants of oneself in the wake of a love lost.","author":"Kilroy J.

The student returned with no flower at hand andsaid, I found the most beautiful flower in the field but I didn't pick it up for I might find a better one, but when I returned to the place, it was gone.We always look for the best in life.

It bears the memory of possibility, of unknown forests, unchartered territories, and a heart light and skipping, hell-bent as the captain of any of the three ships, determined at all costs to prevail to the new world. Turning back was no option. Whatever the gales, whatever the emaciation, whatever the casualty to self, onward I kept my course. My heart felt the magnetism of its own compass guiding me onits direction constant and sure. There was no other way through. I feel it again as once it had been, before it was broken-in; its strength and resolute ardency. The years of solitude were nothing compared to what lay ahead. In sailing for the horizon that part of my life had been sealed up, a gentle eddy, a trough of gentle waves diminishing further, receding away. Whatever loneliness andpain went with the years between the ages of 14 and 20, was closed, irretrievableI was already cast in form and direction in a certain course.When I open the little bottle of eau de toilette five hundred different days unfold within me, conversations so strained, breaking slowly, so painstakingly, to a comfortable place. A place so warm and inviting after the years of silence and introspect, of hiding. A place in the sun that would burn me alive before I let it cast a shadow on me. Until that time I had not known, I had not been conscious of my loneliness. Yes, I had been taciturn in school, alone, I had set myself apart when others tried to engage. But though I was alone, I had not felt the pangs of loneliness. It had not burdened or tormented as such when I first felt the clear tang of its opposite in the form of anothers company. Of Regns company. We came, each in our own way, in our own needlistening, wanting, tentatively, as though we came upon each other from the side in spite of having seen each other head on for two years. It was a gradual advance, much again like a vessel waiting for its sails to catch wind, grasping hold of the ropes and learning much too quickly, all at once, how to move in a certain direction. There was no practicing. It was everything and allfor the first and last time. Everything had to be right, whether it was or not. The waters were beautiful, the work harder than anything in my life, but the very glimpse of any tempest of defeat was never in my line of vision. Id never failed at anything. And though this may sound quite an exaggeration, I tell you earnestly, it is true. Everything to this point Id ever set my mind to, Id achieved. But this wasnt about conquering some land, nor had any of my other desires ever been about proving something.

If you take a closer look, you can observe such behavior all around you. The beautiful bird chirping outside your window. Its a mating call. That pretty little bird is trying to attract a potential mate, so that it can propagate its genes. Why does the peacock have such beautiful feathers? It is to attract a healthy female. He as well is trying to propagate his genes. Even we humans, are not much different from the rest of the animal kingdom when it comes to attracting potential mates. When women dress up for their night out at the club, they are doing so to look attractive. This is a subconscious evolutionary desire to attract as many potential mates as possible.... While women tend to grab attention with their looks, men on the other hand, tend to attract as many potential females as possible, by showing off their resources. When a man shows off with his fancy car, expensive gold watch and suit, or flexes his muscles and brags about how many credit cards he owns, hes doing so to make himself desirable by healthy women, in order to propagate his genes. It is all in the pursuit of reproduction.","author":"Abhijit Naskar, What is Mind?","category":"adultery, brainy-quotes, dating, dating-101, dating-quotes, evolution, evolutionary-biology, evolutionary-psychology, female-sexuality, flirting, human-behavior, human-nature, love, love-quotes, love-quotes-and-sayings, male-female-relationships, male-thinking, primitive-human-behavior, relationship-quotes, science-of-mind, science-quotes, sex-appeal, sexuality, sexy-humor, sexy-quotes, truth, truth-quotes"},{"quote":"In the beginning of our love lives, it is the beastly instinct of sexual attraction that drives us all.

Understanding with knowledge is a burden.You see, Man is always inclined to be intolerant towards the thing, or person, he hasn't taken the time adequately to understand...but once we get closer to people or have experiences of certain situations, we become tolerant of themThe way you react to a stranger over a particular thing might be different from the way you react to a friend, this is because as a friend, you know and understand much about him and could tell one or two reasons he had done what he did but for the stranger, you have no reason why he did whatever he did and would just react.It's normal though but with time, as we get closer, misunderstanding arises; from the misunderstanding, we get to know our individual limits and thus understanding springs.This is one of the reasons I always say we get to know someone better when we get closer to him or her. Once you understand someone, and if you like the person so much, I tell you, with your understanding, you can tolerate whatever the person does.With wisdom and knowledge, it is expected we seek first to understand than to be understood.

If one who was first, in the deep and full sense, your Friend, is then gradually or suddenly revealed as also your lover you will certainly not want to share the Beloveds erotic love with any third. But you will have no jealousy at all about sharing the Friendship.

And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they? It warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from ME, neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was because my heart warn't right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing double. I was letting ON to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth SAY I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't pray a lie--I found that out. So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send.HUCK FINN.I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:\\"All right, then, I'll GO to hell\\"--and tore it up.","author":"Mark Twain, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn","category":"friendship, tolerance"},{"quote":"People really do like seeing their best friends humiliated; a large part of the friendship is based on humiliation; and that is an old truth,well known to all intelligent people.","author":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Gambler","category":"friendship"},{"quote":"And Isi always listened, never told Enna she had been foolish, never said hollow things like 'You'll be all right.' . . .

You are certain that yesterday it was in its proper place, but now there is nothing. Just air.

The only thing that makes our gender weaker, is the fact that we are the gender less likely to stand up for the other. We are the gender more likely to try and make another look bad, and when one of us is already bad, instead of being kind, we pound them into the ditches. And that's what makes us weak, nothing else. If we can change this, we can change the whole structure of our being female, I truly believe this. Personally, I grew up admiring other women and wanting to be friends with them, but unfortunately, I learned the hard way that they were the ones who would hurt me. Women hurt other women all too often, and that's a fact. I'd like to see not just us not hurting one another; but us actually making a conscious effort to be happy for another when she is happy, to hope the best for another when she has better, and to lift another up when she is down. We know that so many of us are harsh, cold and selfish, and we try to protect ourselves from one another, that's the reality. But it's also a reality that what is real can change. So that means we can change it.","author":"C.

But if you break it, a surprising result will follow. If in your working hours you make the work your end, you will presently find yourself all unawares inside the only circle in your profession that really matters. You will be one of the sound craftsmen, and other sound craftsmen will know it. This group of craftsmen will by no means coincide with the Inner Ring or the Important People or the People in the Know. It will not shape that professional policy or work up that professional influence which fights for the profession as a whole against the public: nor will it lead to those periodic scandals and crises which the Inner Ring produces. But it will do those things which that profession exists to do and will in the long run be responsible for all the respect which that profession in fact enjoys and which the speeches and advertisements cannot maintain. And if in your spare time you consort simply with the people you like, you will again find that you have come unawares to a real inside: that you are indeed snug and safe at the center of something which, seen from without, would look exactly like an Inner Ring. But the difference is that its secrecy is accidental, and its exclusiveness a by-product, and no one was led thither by the lure of the esoteric: for it is only four or five people who like one another meeting to do things that they like. This is friendship. Aristotle placed it among the virtues. It causes perhaps half of all the happiness in the world, and no Inner Ring can ever have it.","author":"C.S.

The friend desires an equality of good, the flatterer his own private good. The one aspires after equal honour in virtue, the other after superiority in pleasure. The one in conversation desires an equal freedom of speech, the other servile submission. The one loves truth in association, the other deception; and the one looks to future emolument, but the other to present delight. The one requires to be reminded of his good actions, the other wishes them to be involved in oblivion. The one takes care of the possessions of his friend, as of things common, the other destroys them, as being the property of another. The company of a friend in prosperity is most opportune, and in calamity is most equal; but a flatterer can never be satiated with prosperity, and in adversity he is never to be seen. Friendship is laudable, flattery detestable; for friendship attends to equality of retribution, but this flattery mutilates: for he who pays servile attention to another through indigence, that his wants may be supplied, so far as he does not receive an equal submission in return, will reprobate the inequality. A friend, when his friendship is concealed, is unhappy; on the contrary, a flatterer is miserable when is flattery is not concealed. Friendship when tried is strengthened, flattery is confuted, by time. Friendship requires not to be corroborated by advantage, but flattery cannot subsist without profit; and if men have any communion with the divinities, the pious man is a friend to divinity, but the superstitious is a flatterer of divinity; and the pious man is blessed, but the superstitious is miserable.","author":"Maximus Tyrius, The Dissertations of Maximus Tyrius, Volume 1","category":"flattery, friendship"},{"quote":"It might even teach Murray that while finding true love was one of the most wonderful things that could happen to you in life, finding a friend was equally splendid.","author":"Flix J.

Making friends takes too much time and effort, and for what? I sat on the edge of his bed, understanding how it might seem simpler to go at life solo. Friendship has unique rewards, I told him. They can be unpredictable. For instance.... I couldnt help but pause to smile crookedly at an old memory that was dear to my heart. Then I shared with my son an unforgettable incident from my younger years. True story. When I was about your age, I decided to try out for a school play. Tryouts were to begin after the last class of the day, but first I had to run home to grab a couple props for the monologue I planned to perform during tryouts. Silly me, I had left them at the house that morning. Luckily, I only lived across a long expanse of grassy field that separated the school from the nearest neighborhood. Unluckily, it was raining and I didnt have an umbrella.  Determined to get what I needed, I raced home, grabbed my props, and tore back across the field while my friend waited under the dry protection of the schools wooden eaves. She watched me run in the rain, gesturing for me to go faster while calling out to hurry up or we would be late.  The rain was pouring by that time which was added reason for me to move fast. I didnt want to look like a wet rat on stage in front of dozens of fellow students. Dont ask me why I didnt grab an umbrella from hometeenage pride or lack of focus, Im not surebut the increasing rain combined with the hollering from my friend as well as my anxious nerves about trying out for the play had me running far too fast in shoes that lacked any tread.  About a yard from the sidewalk where the grass was worn from foot traffic and consequently muddied from the downpour of rain, I slipped and fell on my hind end. Me, my props, and my dignity slid through the mud and lay there, coated. My things were dripping with mud. I was covered in it. I felt my heart plunge, and I wanted to cry. I probably would have if it hadnt been for the wonderful thing that happened right then. My crazy friend ran over and plopped herself down in the mud beside me. She wiggled in it, making herself as much a mess as I was. Then she took my slimy hand in hers and pulled us both to our feet. We tried out for the play looking like a couple of swine escaped from a pigsty, laughing the whole time. I never did cry, thanks to my friend. So yes, my dear son, friendship has its unique rewardspriceless ones.","author":"Richelle E.

Without the courage to cut off what refuses to heal, youll end up losing a lot more. Your personal growth - and in some cases your healing - will only be expedited by establishing relationships with the right people. Maybe youve heard the story about the scorpion who asked the frog to carry him across the river because he couldnt swim. Im afraid youll sting me, replied the frog. The scorpion smiled reassuringly and said, Of course I wont. If I did that wed both drown! So the frog agreed, and the scorpion hopped on his back. Wouldnt you know it: halfway across the river the scorpion stung him! As they began to sink the frog lamented, You promised you wouldnt sting me. Whyd you do it? The scorpion replied, I cant help it. Its my nature! Until God changes the other persons nature, they have the power to affect and infect you. For example, when you feel passionately about something but others dont, its like trying to dance a foxtrot with someone who only knows how to waltz. You picked the wrong dance partner! Dont get tied up with someone who doesnt share your values and God-given goals. Some issues can be corrected through counselling, prayer, teaching, and leadership. But you cant teach someone to care; if they dont care theyll pollute your environment, kill your productivity, and break your rhythm with constant complaints. Thats why its important to pray and ask God, Does this person belong in my life?","author":"Patience Johnson","category":"best-inspirational-quotes, best-motivational-quotes, courage, dealing-with-people, family, famous-authors, friendship, happiness, inspi-rational-quotes-of-the-day, inspirational-quotes-about-life, inspirational-quotes-for-work, inspirational-quotes-of-the-day, inspiring-leaders, life, life-quotes-inspirational-quotes, love, motivational, motivational-quotes, quotes-of-the-day-motivational, short-inspira-tional-quotes, success"},{"quote":"My heart and my soul are best of friends.And their friendship startedthe day you and I first met.","author":"Frederick Espiritu, One Whole Naked Me","category":"friendship, love, poem, quote"},{"quote":"Lately, he had been wondering if codependence was such a bad thing.

But the self that we love is always just one one step behind whatever we can actually articulate.

It calls for getting a grip on your temper and not saying things youll later regret: Better  a man who controls his temper than one who takes a city (Proverbs 16:32 NIV 1984 Edition). It calls for getting a grip on your desires. If Joseph had failed to say no to the repeated advances of his boss wife, hed never have seen his lifes dream fulfilled and sat on the throne of Egypt.

When Lincoln heard he replied, If Stanton said Im a fool then I must be, for hes nearly always right, and he says what he thinks. Ill step over and see for myself. He did, and when Stanton convinced him the order was in error, Lincoln quietly withdrew it. Part of Lincolns greatness lay in his ability to rise above pettiness, ego, and sensitivity to other peoples opinions. He wasnt easily offended. He welcomed criticism, and in doing so demonstrated one of the strengths of a truly great person: humility. So, have you been criticised?

[W]e soon found ourselves on pretty much our former terms of sociability and confidence. Melville has not been well, of late; ... and no doubt has suffered from too constant literary occupation, pursued without much success, latterly; and his writings, for a long while past, have indicated a morbid state of mind.... Melville, as he always does, began to reason of Providence and futurity, and of everything that lies beyond human ken, and informed me that he had \\"pretty much made up his mind to be annihilated\\"; but still he does not seem to rest in that anticipation; and, I think, will never rest until he gets hold of a definite belief.
