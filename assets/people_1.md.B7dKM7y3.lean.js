wayhis quick pace strength on the ball and creativity earned him a callup to the national team and he earned his first cap in september 1993 during a match against germany following a promising performance he carved out a virtually permanent place for himself in the countrys national team for the next eleven yearstunisians grew to appreciate his discretion in life outside football as a modest and determined professional on the pitch he singularly distinguished himself at international level during the 1996 african cup of nations finals in south africa as one of the best players of the tournament sellimi became a household name throughout the country a skillful and talented bright spark who carried the team to the final of the tournament for the second time in their history sellimi struck twice in the semifinal against zambia and was widely considered one of the best players in the tournamentthis movement into the limelight earned the player a transfer to french ligue 1 side fc nantes atlantique following another impressive showing at the 1996 olympic games in atlanta but his move to france marked the start of a long barren period although the nantes fans dubbed him the lung on account of the distance he clocked up during matches he never really settled in at his new club he hit just two goals in 30 appearances in his first season and failed to achieve the kind of success he had enjoyed back home in tunisia after another disappointing season in 199798 sellimi left nantes for spanish second division side real jan it was here that he got some firstclass

took a gamble on sellimi and partnered the player with other tunisian internationals anchorman zoubeir baya and fellow striker mehdi benslimane but here too he took a long time finding his true form and many at freiburg considered him a mistaken purchase during his first year however he proved his detractors wrong in the best possible way in the 19992000 season sellimi just could not stop scoring goals and even headed the bundesligas goalscoring list going into the winter breaka disappointing 2001 lead to sellimi missing out on the 2002 african cup of nations in mali and a number of international friendlies after a fallout with former national coach henri michel but the frenchmans replacement with ammar souayah coupled with the national teams goal drought brought about his recall the 2002 world cup in korea and japan turned out to be adel sellimis swansong in premier football competitions and he retired from international football shortly after the tournament at the age of 31

and impartial judge who has appropriate fitness and temperament for the appellate court we believe that a close examination of judge chatignys record in sentencing federal criminal defendants shows that he is appropriately sensitive to the facts of the person before him and the rights of victims of the crimes that have been committed indeed it is our understanding that the government has never filed an appeal from judge chatignys sentencings and that there has only been one defendant who has appealed from an upward departure we are of the strong opinion that judge chatignys record on the

civil matters judge chatigny has proven himself over the course of 15 years on the bench to be unbiased compassionate and temperatein its 2006 dismissal of charges in the ross case the second circuit

neves law can only be understood through legal problems roughly legal cases which have to be solved within the legal system including a necessary connection to morality law he claims is not something given or previous but the solution to legal problems legal problems are the decisive starting point his opposition to positivism to natural law and to the several theories of legal syllogism would make him one of the first and most accomplished advocates of interpretivismcastanheira neves however has always claimed that law the task of lawyers is not essentially interpretive or hermeneutical but practical ie action guiding he maintains that legal interpretation is not a necessary feature of legal reasoning on the contrary law always arises from legal problems which are concrete historically situated normative and practical every legal decision aims to settle what someone legally ought to do in a particular case in a particular historical and social situation and that is its defining feature a legal decision is also itself an action interpretation is not always needed and when it is it is auxiliarythe central tenets of castanheira neves philosophy of law were made clear in his 1967 massive book on the philosophical and methodological distinction between matter of fact and matter of law castanheira neves addresses the similarities and significant differences between his and dworkins theses in the last part of his 2003 bookcastanheira neves also claims that there is no law in general norms rules principles etc as laid down by legislators but only in solving particular cases to this thesis he calls jurisprudentialismlaw is not an element but a synthesis not a premise for validity but fulfilled validity not a prius but a posterius not a given but a solution it is not in the beginning but in the end castanheira neves 1967 p 586in this he was preceded by authors like viehweg and schools of thought like critical legal studies but he differed from these authors as he claimed it to be essential to law as a normative matter and not only descriptively his position is therefore equivalent in this subject to j dancys later moral particularism

to both the british and swedish parliaments about the catastrophic impact on yanomami health as a consequence of the illegal invasion of their land by 40000 garimpeiros or goldminers prince charles publicly called the situation genocide in a sevenyear period from 19871993 one fifth of the yanomami died from malaria and other diseases transmitted by the minersof all yanomami who have emerged as public figures probably the most important is davi kopenawa yanomami davi kopenawa was born near the rio toototobi near the border of venezuela he learned portuguese from a christian mission run by new tribes mission an american evangelical organization specializing in the proselytization of isolated peoples the acquisition of portuguese language proficiency then rare among the yanomami enabled davi kopenawa to interact with brazils lusophone majority both directly and through the mass mediain his own words translated from portuguesei know that the authorities and many people came here because the planet is sick and they are trying to find out how to cure it the people who come from many places from the other side of the big lake all come here to learn about how we live i want to speak giving the message from omai omai is the creator of the yanomami who also has created all the shaboris that are the shamans the shaboris are the ones that have the knowledge and they sent two of us to deliver their message the message is to stop destruction to stop taking out minerals from under the ground to stop taking out the steel with which all the metal utensils are made and to stop building roads we feel that a lot of riches have already been taken out of the indigenous lands and a lot of these riches are getting old and useless and it would be much better if the brazilian government would give these riches to the poor in brazil our work is to protect nature the wind the mountains the forest the animals and this is what we want to teach you peopledavi kopenawa is the soninlaw of another traditional tribal leader with whom he apprenticed to be a shaman his wife lost much of her family to measles and other diseases brought to the area in the 1970s by road construction crews and garimpeiros smalltime gold miners davi kopenawa has mentioned this as part of his personal motivation to speak out on his peoples behalf davi was orphaned as a child when his parents died from diseases transmitted by outsidersafter some months of staying on our territory they started to transmit malaria to us that means that the garimpeiros were already sick mosquitos bit the garimpeiros and then bit us that is how we got the disease the garimpeiros also brought in other diseases there are complications of pneumonia sometimes associated with malaria tuberculosis skin diseases that often are associated with other diseases and especially in children can be fatal there was an epidemic of yellow fever in the area hepatitis in the 1980s he began working for the brazilian government organization fundao nacional do ndio funai at a post in demini in the center of yanomami territory as an intermediary between the government and indigenous peoples with whom outsiders had little or no contact he also accompanied health workers to yanomami villages and has worked closely with organizations such as comisso pryanomami ccpy and survival international in the fight for the integrity of yanomami lands in brazilsince the invasion of yanomami territory began in 1987 by illegal goldminers davi kopenawa has worked for their removal from the area and for the creation of a parkland therein his action resulted in death threats from the miners and an award from the united nations environment programme in 1988 after a major international campaign led by davi survival international and ccpy the brazilian government finally recognized yanomami land rights in 1992 just before the uns earth summitdavi kopenawas unique role among his people has been commented on skeptically even by those sympathetic to him and his cause anthropologist napoleon chagnon wrote regarding davi kopenawa his nonyanomam supporters in brazil intelligent and wellintentioned advocates of the yanomam cause are promoting him as a spokesman for his people such a role exists largely because our culture must deal with other cultures through their leaders it is the only way we know how to deal with them everything i know about davi kobenaw is positive and i am confident that he is a sincere and honest man when i read his proclamations i am moved but i am also sure thatsomeone from our culture wrote them they have too much the voice of rousseaus idealism and sound very nonyanomam my concern is that he is being put into a difficult position fraught with consequences for the future of the yanomam for one thing there is currently no such thing as a panyanomam awareness and so he cannot possibly be speaking for the venezuelan yanomamsurvival international and many others with extensive experience of the yanomami have severely criticized chagnons work which portrays the yanomami as sly aggressive and intimidating and falsely claims that they live in a state of chronic warfare this characterization has undoubtedly been detrimental for them it was referred to by the brazilian government when it planned to fragment yanomami land in 1988 in a proposal which would have been catastrophic for the indians and which was only prevented by a vigorous campaignchagnons views in this matter were criticized by investigative journalist patrick tierney in his muchdefamed book darkness in el doradodavi has spoken out for over 20 years and visited many countries with his message about the importance of respecting indigenous peoples rights and their fundamental and unique role in conserving rainforest for the benefit of humanityin 2004 davi and other yanomami in brazil set up an organization called hutukara to defend their rights as well as advocating for yanomami rights it runs educational projects where yanomami teachers work in the communities teaching literacy maths geography and human rightsdavi continues to speak out about the dangers facing the yanomami he has warned about the impact large scale mining will have on the yanomami if the brazilian congress votes to allow mining on indigenous landswe the yanomami people think that mining will not bring any benefits to anyone it will only destroy nature it will only destroy the streams and the rivers and kill the fish and kill the environment and kill us and bring in diseases which never existed in our land it will bring roads and people who will bring in disease guns and violence so we the yanomami people do not want the national congress to approve the law or the president to sign it we do not want to accept this law our land has to be respected our land is our heritage a heritage which protects us this land belongs to us so that we can plant hunt be healthy it is our home where will live for the rest of our livesin 2009 he was honoured by the bartolome de las casas award in spain and later gave a speech to the uk parliament where he warned that

switched his research field to condensed matter physics while working with theoretical physicists robert schrieffer frank wilczek anthony zee in institute for theoretical physics uc santa barbara19871989wen introduced the notion of topological order 1989 and quantum order 2002 to describe a new class of matter states this opens up a new research direction in condensed matter physics he found that states with topological order contain nontrivial boundary excitations and developed chiral luttinger theory for the boundary states 1990 the boundary states can become ideal conduction channel which may lead to device application of topological phases he proposed the simplest topological order z2 topological order 1990 which turns out to be the topological order in the toric code he also proposed a special class of topological order nonabelian quantum hall states they contain emergent particles with nonabelian statistics which generalizes the well known bose and fermi statistics nonabelian particles may allow us to perform fault tolerant quantum computations with michael levin he found that stringnet condensations can give rise to a large class of topological orders 2005 in particular stringnet condensation provides a unified origin of photons electrons and other elementary particles 2003 it unifies two fundamental phenomena gauge interactions and fermi statistics he pointed out that topological order is nothing but the pattern of long range entanglements this led to a notion of symmetry protected topological spt order shortrange entangled states with symmetry and its description by group cohomology of the symmetry group 2011 the notion of spt order generalizes the notion of topological insulator to interacting cases he also proposed the su2 gauge theory of

toured the country during winters when the circus was not operatingaudiences at shows put on by the troupe were often quite hostile toward the performers after years of trying to appease the crowds with traditional performance styles riggs began to request input from them as an example he might ask who do you hate in this town if the audience replied the mayor the performers would quickly

preferring the phrase instant theater later a new york times critic called riggs performances word jazz while members of the second city troupe visiting in the 1960s and 1970s referred to the shows as
