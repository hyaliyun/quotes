Socrates feigns ignorance and tricks others into spelling out their views on such abstract concepts. Then, with a series of seemingly ignorant questions, he forces them into such a state of self-contradiction that they finally give in and admit that they don&#39;t know what they are talking about.</p><p>It was the incredible magnanimity of the Athenians that allowed them to tolerate this for decades.

It is not innate, but must be learned before it can be used. It is not a perfect way of communication.

Therefore, everyone has been in a state of absolute loneliness since childhood, and they feel fear and anxiety at all times. Over time, this has led to suspicion and persecution between people.

When people knew that smoking increased the risk of cancer and the best solution was to stop smoking, they wanted to invent a cigarette that did not cause cancer.

The man accepted without hesitation and said that as long as the horse could cooperate with him and let him command the retreat, they could kill the wolf immediately. The horse agreed to this condition and allowed the man to put the reins and saddle on it.

Can&#39;t you really see that? The outer regions of the Milky Way no longer use nuclear energy. On a planet in the Andromeda III system, a nuclear power plant melted down due to poor maintenance.

The Seldon Crisis cannot be solved by individuals, but by the power of history. When Hari Seldon planned the future historical trajectory for us, he did not consider any heroes, but rather the great historical trends of the economy and society.

To paraphrase Seyfer Harding&#39;s famous warning, it is a weapon that works equally well on both sides. If Coril prospers because of trade with us, our economy will benefit as well. Conversely, if Coril&#39;s factories go out of business because of the interruption of trade with us, and other worlds suffer from depression because of trade isolation, our factories will also close down, and the base will also fall into depression.&quot;</p><p>---058---</p><p>It is wrong to think that only a few, very lucky people are creative.

The dignity of an independent nation must not be humiliated in this way.</p><p>---090---</p><p>&quot;Think about it. Until now, the power of trade has always been underestimated. For a long time, everyone thought that in order to make trade a powerful weapon, we must have a priest class under our control. But this is not the case. This discovery can be said to be my contribution. Trade without priests! Pure trade! In fact, it is already powerful in itself.&quot;</p><p>---091---</p><p>To explain the changes that have taken place in my life, I must talk about my views on friendship. In books and movies, people often see lifelong childhood friendships: childhood classmates keep in touch in the years to come; comrades in the army drink together and reminisce about the scenes of life in the barracks; college classmates help each other out of old friendship. These things may be true, but I have always been skeptical about it. In my opinion, going to school together and being close to each other in the army are not chosen by oneself. A friendship that is born out of habit and mutual proximity can only exist between people who happen to be like-minded, or between people who have shared hardships outside the artificial environment of school or the army.</p><p>---092---</p><p>Although I was Jewish and poor, I ended up receiving a first-rate American education at one of the nation&#39;s top universities. I can&#39;t help but wonder how many African Americans have had the same opportunity. I condemn anti-Semitism, and I condemn all acts of cruelty between people, because I would be wrong to say otherwise. Some Jews I know are just that blind. They can be very passionate about condemning anti-Semitism, but when it comes to the subject of African Americans, they change their tune without even taking a breath, and sound like a bunch of little Hitlers. I once heard a woman righteously accuse Christians of doing nothing to help the Jews in Europe. She said, &quot;You can&#39;t trust the Christians.&quot; I paused for a moment, then suddenly asked her, &quot;What have you done to help black people get their rights?&quot; She replied, &quot;Look, I have my own problems.&quot; I said, &quot;So do Christians.&quot; She looked at me blankly, not understanding what I was saying. What can be done? The whole world seems to be...</p><p>---093---</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s what you did in your earthly life. And why?&quot; Murray said, &quot;To discover and master knowledge that only I could obtain, to gain the praise of my companions, to feel satisfied with my achievements knowing that I had only a limited number of years to achieve my ideal. Now I can only get what you can get with a little effort. You won&#39;t praise me, you will only find it interesting. Once I have unlimited time to achieve a goal, then all the results will make me neither proud nor satisfied.&quot;</p><p>---094---</p><p>Since the extent of revision of theories becomes smaller and smaller, even a very old theory must have had sufficient truth to make progress possible, and this truth cannot be obliterated by later revisions.</p><p>---095---</p><p>When I talk about my travels, I am often asked if I have been to Israel. No, I have not. It is too complicated to get to Israel without flying. I can only travel by boat and train. This would certainly take a lot of time and be much more complicated. It is beyond my ability to bear. However, there is a presumption that since I am Jewish, I must be eager to go to Israel. If I don&#39;t go, or can&#39;t go to Israel, I must be heartbroken. - But I haven&#39;t. In fact, I am not a Zionist. I don&#39;t think that Jews have some right to occupy that land today because their ancestors lived there 1900 years ago (according to this theory, we would have to give North and South America to the Native Americans and Australia and New Zealand to the Aboriginals and Maori). I also don&#39;t think that the promise made by God in the Bible that Canaan would belong to the descendants of the Israelites forever is true and legal.</p><p>---096---</p><p>&quot;You laugh at the ignorance of ordinary space-time dwellers, because they think there is only one reality. I laugh at the ignorance of eternal beings, because you know there are countless realities, but you think only one can be realized.&quot;</p><p>---097---</p><p>Everyone hides himself in a fog that others cannot penetrate, and there is only one person in each fog. Occasionally, a faint and vague signal will emerge from the depths of a fog - humans use these signals to grope each other. However, since they cannot understand each other, they cannot trust or forgive each other, so everyone has been in a state of absolute loneliness since childhood, feeling fear and anxiety at all times. Over time, this has led to suspicion and persecution between people.</p><p>---098---</p><p>Because I love you, you know. I fell in love with you long before I met you. - Noy</p><p>---099---</p><p>Babies are born with three instinctive fears: of loud noises, of falling, and of light. That&#39;s why jumping in front of someone and yelling &#39;Wow&#39; is considered so much fun, and that&#39;s why riding a roller coaster is so much fun. That&#39;s why the &#39;Mystery Tunnel&#39; is making a killing. People come out of the darkness shaking, gasping, and scared to death, but they keep buying tickets.</p><p>---100---</p><p>Death is an eternal dreamless sleep.</p><p>---101---</p><p>Those who think they know it all are a huge annoyance to those of us who do know it.</p><p>---102---</p><p>Is there anything more feminine than the Victorian woman - weak, modest, shy, breathless, impossibly elegant, constantly having to resort to nasal salts to ward off abject fainting spells? Is there a more ridiculous monstrosity than the Victorian woman? Is there anything more insulting to the dignity of Homo sapiens?</p><p>---103---</p><p>&quot;The laws of history are as absolute as the laws of physics. If they are more likely to be inaccurate, it is only because the objects of history, that is, human beings, are not as numerous as the atoms of physics, and therefore the differences between individual objects have a greater impact.&quot; - Bettel</p><p>---104---</p><p>Unlimited self-confidence may be an overcompensation for inferiority complex.</p><p>---105---</p><p>There are two ways to hide an object. You can put it where no one can find it, or you can put it where no one wants to look at it, such as putting it right under people&#39;s noses, where they can see it at a glance.</p><p>---106---</p><p>&quot;But you haven&#39;t tried, not even once, so how do you know? At the beginning, you refused to acknowledge the village that was threatened, then you clung to your blind trust in the emperor, and now you have shifted your hope to Seldon - from beginning to end, you have either relied on authority or relied on the ancients, and never made your own decisions.&quot;</p><p>Harding became more and more excited, and his fists clenched tighter and tighter involuntarily. &quot;This creates a kind of pathology, a conditioned reflex. When you need to challenge authority, your ability to think independently is completely shut down. In your mind, His Majesty the Emperor is undoubtedly more powerful than you, and Dr. Seldon must be wiser than you. This is simply ridiculous, don&#39;t you think?&quot;</p><p>---107---</p><p>It wasn&#39;t until this moment that she realized that she was already standing in front of a ticket vending machine. The use of this machine is quite simple. Just put a high-denomination banknote into the coin feeding slot, wait until the banknote is sucked in, and then press the button marked with the destination, and the ticket vending machine will spit out a ship ticket. , and automatically retrieve excess money. This kind of machine uses an electronic scanning device to identify the denomination of banknotes, so there is absolutely no error. No one needs to spend five minutes studying such an ordinary ticket vending machine.</p><p>---108---</p><p>The Bible says that those who have been persecuted should not persecute others: &quot;You shall not wrong a foreigner nor oppress him, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.&quot; Who does what the Bible says? I try to promote this. When I do this, I just make myself weird and unpopular.</p><p>---109---</p><p>If they are dangerous because they have nuclear power, then it is much better for us to establish close friendship with them through trade relations than to dominate them through unreliable religions. Because the latter... is nothing more than a hateful hegemony, and if it shows any signs of weakness, it will collapse completely. In the end, nothing will be left except endless fear and hatred.</p><p>---110---</p><p>No suitable methods were proposed to test their suggestions, no useful predictions were made, and to those educated in the field, the arguments were lacking or unclear.</p><p>---111---</p><p>Now the true face of eternal time and space has been clearly presented before his eyes: a group of increasingly sick neurotics, collective paranoid patients, a group of desperate people, living a torn and distorted life.</p><p>---112---</p><p>The person who made these conjectures has no status in this field or shows signs of lacking knowledge of the work that has been done in this field.</p><p>---113---</p><p>That evening, I called Stan. &quot;Stan,&quot; I said to him, &quot;the newspaper wants to pay me for speaking. I had forgotten about it, and I told them I was under the impression it was free. If they come and ask if you have to pay me, please tell them they have to.&quot; After a brief silence, Stan said angrily, &quot;Why are you calling me on a Friday night to tell me this?&quot; I was surprised: &quot;What does it matter when I tell you?&quot; &quot;Now I have to wait until Monday morning to tell the latest story about my stupid brother Isaac.&quot;</p><p>---114---</p><p>In the coming gender-equal society, the differences between the sexes will become blurred. In fact, this blurring has already begun. What is the result? A boy knows who the girl is close to him, and vice versa; but if the other person is not in this relationship, how can he or she care who is who?</p><p>---115---</p><p>I find that women are often annoyed by our mutual banter. They seem unable to comprehend the intimacy of male intimacy, when they say, &quot;Hello, you filthy, slick horse thief,&quot; which really means, &quot;My dear charming good friend, how are you?&quot; Well, that&#39;s how Arthur and I go, though we manage to inject a little wit into our formal English.</p><p>---116---</p><p>I was often laughed at, sometimes openly by uncouth young men, but more often by educated people with a cold jeer, and I accepted it as part of the way things were, something I could not change.</p><p>---117---</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this is how things should be.</p><p>---118---</p><p>The dead past is equal to the living present.</p><p>---119---</p><p>Don&#39;t let your morals stop you from doing the right thing</p><p>---120---</p><p>You cannot sit idly by and watch your fellow citizens suffer harm.</p><p>How you treat the humble and helpless today is how others will treat you tomorrow.</p><p>---121---</p><p>All so-called pious people like him have one thing in common: for their own benefit, they will not hesitate to cut your throat, but they dare not endanger your unrealistic and ethereal soul.</p><p>---122---</p><p>By implementing strategic sales in strategic locations, a core faction can be established in the court.</p><p>---123---</p><p>Even perfect people are bound to make mistakes, and it is this point that makes a person confident without being arrogant.</p><p>---124---</p><p>Humans are the only animals that can derive pleasure from the growth of useless knowledge.</p><p>---125---</p><p>Andrew lay on the bed, his consciousness gradually becoming blurred.</p><p>He was clinging to those consciousnesses. Man! He was a man! He wanted this to be his last consciousness. He was going to end with it—dying.</p><p>He opened his eyes again and recognized Qi Lixin, who looked serious, for the last time. There were other people around, but they were just shadows, unidentifiable shadows. In the deepening gray, the only clear thing was Qi Lixin. He slowly reached out his hand to her and vaguely felt her holding it.</p><p>The last bit of consciousness slipped away, and finally she was gone.</p><p>Before she completely disappeared, before everything stopped, one last fleeting consciousness crept into his mind and lingered for a moment.</p><p>&quot;Little Miss...&quot; He called in a low voice, but no one heard him.</p><p>---126---</p><p>The fact that Velikovsky could present himself as a persecuted martyr casts a ray of Galilean light on all his efforts and destroys any attempt by astronomers to demonstrate clearly and impartially the errors in Velikovsky&#39;s views. All attempts in this direction could be (and were) dismissed as persecution.</p><p>This also casts a heroic light on the followers of Velikovsky. They can attack an orthodoxy, which is usually regarded as a heroic act, but they can do so in complete safety because in reality (contrary to the fantasies of Velikovsky and his ilk) the orthodoxy does not and could not fight back.</p><p>---127---</p><p>The Empire is now represented by soldiers and officials in every corner of the galaxy; it is they who have become a burden on the people, not the Emperor himself.</p><p>Therefore, when he was led into a room of moderate size and luxurious decoration, and saw a young man sitting on a corner of a table in a window alcove, one foot touching the ground and the other dangling on the edge of the table, Seldon could not help wondering how such an official could look at him with such a gentle gaze. He had experienced this fact over and over again, that government officials, especially those serving the emperor, always looked very serious, as if they were carrying the weight of the entire galaxy on their shoulders. And it seemed that the less important the official, the more serious and ferocious his expression was.</p><p>Then, this person may be a high-ranking official. The power he really wants to hold is like the bright sunshine, so he does not need to face problems with a gloomy face.</p><p>---128---</p><p>She seemed to have become a part of his body, but separated from the other parts. She could not be directed by thoughts and could only communicate with words.</p><p>---129---</p><p>This was a great progress in Harun&#39;s life. He finally had someone to talk to, to whom he could talk about his life, his behavior, and his thoughts. She seemed to have become a part of his body, but separated from the other parts. He could not direct her with his mind, but could only communicate with her through language. She also had independent thinking and could give unexpected answers to his questions.</p><p>---130---</p><p>0</p><p>---131---</p><p>I condemn anti-Semitism, and I condemn all acts of cruelty between people, because I would be wrong to say otherwise.</p><p>---132---</p><p>Oden had a kind of pride in his own swimming style that he had never told others. He thought his posture was beautiful and eye-catching. He had mentioned this idea to Rosten before. (He talked about everything in front of his mentor.) But Rosten said: &quot;Have you ever thought that the lover or the caregiver would think that his swimming style is the most beautiful? Since you are born with different thinking and behavior, is it necessary to be proud of this difference? You know, even in the same family, we cannot exclude each other&#39;s personality.&quot;</p><p>---133---</p><p>At first he could not see anything, then something blurry floated in the corner of his eyes, and gradually turned into a ball of violet light floating in the air. He turned his face, and the ball of light followed him. He closed his eyes, and the ball of light was still in the same place.</p><p>The ball of light grew bigger and bigger. He gradually became uneasy and felt that the ball of light was inside his head. He was not real color, but colorful music to be exact. He could touch it but could not feel it. The ball of light turned into a rainbow which kept floating above his head and then exploded. It burned instantly when touched.</p><p>Green bubbles appeared like a sudden shower. He could not see his own hands, nor could he feel the movement of the bubbles. He shouted silently, and the hallucination ended.</p><p>---134---</p><p>But on the moon, there is no past at all.
