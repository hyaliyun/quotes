Roth","quote":"harold d roth is professor of religious studies and the director of the contemplative studies initiative roth is a specialist in methods of textual criticism and textual history classical chinese religious thought classical daoism the comparative study of mysticism and one of the pioneers of the new interdisciplinary academic field of contemplative studiesduring an academic career spanning over three decades roth has done ground breaking work in three major intellectual fields in the first textual criticism following the lead of the late soas professor paul thompson roth did the first complete textual history of a major classical chinese philosophical work which he published in his first book the textual history of the huainan tzu working towards the goal of establishing modern critical editions of all the major extant works of the classical period roth developed a distinctive method he called filiation analysis a technique for determining the broadest range of possibly authentic textual variants using the bare minimum number of editions this is detailed in his very first publication filiation analysis and the textual criticism of the huainan tzu it is further developed as a model for all classical chinese philosophical texts in a later publication text and edition in early chinese philosophical literaturethe second major area in which roth has done pioneering work is in reconstructing the lost history and contemplative dimensions of the late warring states and early han dynasty tradition that he dubbed inner cultivation it is this tradition that was given the moniker daoism by the grand historian sima tan circa 110 bce beginning with three publications in the early to mid 1990s psychology and selfcultivation in early taoistic thought who compiled the chuang tzu and redaction criticism and the early history of taoism roth began a detailed textual analysis of classical chinese texts on inner cultivation demonstrating that they contained a distinctive set of technical terms that could be organized under three philosophical categories cosmology psychologyinner cultivation and political thought expanding the work of ac graham he further determined that these extant sources of inner cultivation could be organized into three distinctive philosophical groupings individualist primitivist and syncretist and argued these could be considered different phases in the development of this classical daoist tradition roth systematized these arguments in providing the intellectual context for his translation of a short and distinctive text entitled neiye inward training one of 76 works in the guanzi compendium published in his second book original tao inward training and the foundations of taoist mysticism and returned to them in a recent article detailed the contributions to the development of the foundational philosophical idea of li pattern principle made by this classical daoist tradition in the classical daoist concept of li and early chinese cosmologyin developing these theories about the inner cultivation tradition roth broke new ground in systematically applying the methods of the philosophical analysis of different traditions of mystical experience to the classical chinese religious traditions in addition to being summarized in original tao his work in this area is detailed in a number of important other publications evidence for stages of meditation in early taoism lao tzu in the context of early taoist mystical praxis and bimodal mystical experience in the qiwulun of zhuangzistarting when he entered the phd program at the university of toronto in 1975 roth began a fascination with the early han dynasty 139 bce philosophical compendium the huainanzi until recently the last great untranslated work of classical chinese philosophy intended as a comprehensive multiauthored text detailing all the fields of knowledge with which the chinese emperor needed to be conversant the huainanzi contains chapters on cosmology and cosmogony astronomy geography rulership and warfare to name a few of its major topics roth has argued that while the huainanzi is inclusive of a very wide range philosophical ideas from many traditions that its overarching intellectual context is provided by the inner cultivation tradition of classical daoism after working on the textual history of this major work in his first book in the mid 1990s roth developed a project for the first complete english translation with colleague john major and eventually a small cohort of additional scholars that included most importantly sarah queen and andrew meyer together they succeeded in finally publishing a complete translation the huainanzi a guide to the theory and practice of government in early han china and an abridged translation the essential huainanzi in addition to his work on these translations and to his first book roth has published his ideas on the philosophy of the huainanzi in a number of publications including the concept of human nature in the huainan tzu nature and selfcultivation in huainanzis original way daoist inner cultivation thought and the textual structure of the huainanzi and huainanzi and early han daoismroth has not only been a leader in developing the new academic field of contemplative studies he is also the person who first coined the term combining the disciplines of the relevant brain sciences humanities and creative arts around the systematic third and firstperson study of contemplative experiences across cultures and across time this new field presents bold new pedagogies and research techniques that return the unbiased perspective of the experiencing subject to both classroom and laboratory inspired by the work of scientists such as francisco varela james austin and richard davidson philosophers such as william james and evan thompson and educators such as john dewey and parker palmer brown contemplative studies has served as a model for research institutes and academic programs at many institutions of higher education throughout north america roth has helped pioneer the field through such publications as contemplative studies prospects for a new field columbia teachers college record 2006 against cognitive imperialism religion east and west 2008 contemplative studies can it flourish in the religious studies

according to which innocent threat eg the body of falling person is about to kill you by crushing you to death but who was thrown off the top of a building by an evil villain is on a moral par with bystander or one who is not at all responsible for whatever endangers your life imagine a javelin is heading toward you and will kill you unless you pull bystander into its path so it kills bystander instead because it would be morally impermissible to kill bystander in this way it would also be morally impermissible for you to kill falling person by say vaporizing him with a ray gun further it is morally impermissible to kill an innocent aggressor or someone who endangers your life because of her intention to kill you but whose actions are beyond her control imagine someone who has been hypnotized and whose aim is to kill you it is wrong to kill innocent aggressor because he is on a moral par with innocent threat who is on a par with bystander so it is wrong to kill innocent
