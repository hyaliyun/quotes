grunwald sauka now lives in dusetos a small and remote village among numerous lakes and forests sauka believes that the human spirit must be stripped from conventional chains in order to contemplate the true condition of its body and soul a full appreciation of his artwork requires an understanding of the extent and cruelty of the communist terror in lithuania and other countries of eastern europe and a grasp of some of the underlying metaphysical and archetypal ideas that are basic to his world view and sensibilityarnas sauka is considered to be one of the most significant postmodernist painters in lithuania his work is often referred to as different however the difference in saukas paintings is quite consistent because he usually uses his own face sometimes faces of his family members or relatives in many of his paintings the victim and aggressor both have the same facethe scope of saukas imagination includes various manifestations of corruption rotting and deterioration usually connected with human corporeality understood as the antithesis to the christian ideal of redemption and that of corporeal resurrection here we meet horrorstruck gnoticism mixed with postmodern irony the artists world is not a theophany but a place of gnostic terror abandonment and submission to malign forces however the labyrinth of material darkness is also a vessel where alchemical work can be done while supported by the creative imagination hence pathology is inherently mythologized just as all mythology is pathologized sauka stands against both the dematerialization and the spiritualization of reality he partly follows the tradition of classical european painting especially as regards various techniques and principles of expression though creating quite a different context where any traces of aristotelian logic vanish and the forces of evil become permanent and irrefutable in a sense sauka not only symbolizes the gloomy end of christian civilization and its methphysics sic but also reveals the foolish face of the 20th century which appears when the masks of rationality and seeming wisdom are stripped away algis udavinys dr of philosophy 10

of cation demixing which lent great insight into understanding clay flocculation investigations in organic matter interactions with clay minerals led to the development of the idea of dual mode bonding in which amphipathic molecules interact with substrates by both hydrophobichydrophobic and hydrophillichydrophillic interactions laird et al 2008 showed that smectites a class of clay minerals found in soil can adsorb tremendous amounts of organic materials and hence strongly influence the transport and bioavailability of organic materials including pesticides applied to the soil in a study

for a cigar brand he accepted and discovered he liked advertising when people saw his videos they told pavel he was a gifted storyteller and encouraged him to try his hand at cinema with the money from his ad work he started making short filmspavel giroud had to do everything from image to sound when he directed his first short film he even featured his friends in his movies rather than professional actorsthe only film poster he has allowed in his apartment is the one for todo por ella which he made with five friends in 2002 that film really opened doors for me he recalls gratefully most importantly it led to the excellent 3x2 which won the prize for best first film at the 2004 montreal film festival 3x2 was a joint effort among three young directors giroud along with lester hamlet and esteban insausti each had 30 minutes to portray a love affair the film opens with girouds flash set in modernday havana where a photographer becomes infatuated with a 1950s fashion model it

at the collge de france in 2001 brunet announced the discovery in central africa of the skull and jaw remains of a late miocene hominid nicknamed touma these remains are believed to predate the earliest previously known hominid remains lucy by over three million yearsbrunet was born in 1940 in vienne in the region of poitou after having passed his first years in the countryside at 8 he moved with his family to versailles he took a phd in paleontology at the sorbonne and then became professor of vertebrate paleontology at the university of poitiers specializing in hoofed mammalsa turning point in brunets career was when he heard that paleoanthropologist david pilbeam was searching for fossil apes in pakistan and the ancestors of the hominids this spurred brunet to form with his colleague emile heintz a team with the idea of also searching for extinct apes across the border from pakistan in afghanistan the expedition was unsuccessful and no fossil apes were foundin the 1980s brunet and pilbeam matched together and moved to africa their idea was to verify the theory of yves coppens that hominids had first rose in the savannas of eastern africa the two paleontologists idea was that the shores of lake chad were particularly indicated to work as a magnet for mammals and maybe also hominids in 1984 searching begun in cameroon but the nine field seasons spent there were discouraging with no hominids founda new opportunity presented itself to brunet when the government of chad gave him the permission to conduct researches in the djurab desert that due the chadian civil war had long been closed to foreigners brunet promptly formed the frenchchadian paleoanthropological mission mission paloanthropologique francotchadienne or mpft a francochadian scientific alliance that united the university of poitiers the university of ndjamena and the centre nationale dappui la recherche cnarthe area proved itself to be a site rich in fossils and expeditions headed by brunet have collected over 8000 of them including hominid remains on january 23 1995 he spotted a jawbone 35 million years old that he classified as a new species of australopithecine the australopithecus bahrelghazali informally he called it abel as a tribute to his dead friend abel brillanceau abel was the first fossil hominid found in western africa radically transforming the discussions on early hominid distribution that until this discovery was thought to center only in southern and especially eastern africawhile much discussed a yet more important find was to be made by brunets team on july 19 2001 a chadian student of the mission ahounta djimdoumalbaye unearthed a nearly complete cranium from 6 to 7 million years old nicknamed touma by the chadian president idriss dby and classified by brunet as the first exemplary of the sahelanthropus tchadensis brunet and others like tim white are strongly convinced toumai to be a hominid though this is contested by colleagues like milford wolpoff who instead believe it to be an ape other experts like chris stringer argued it was inconclusive where the sahelanthropus belongs in the human evolutionary line1 brunet has argued that further excavations have uncovered additional remains which further confirm that sahelanthropus was a hominid though his conclusions with these newer findings are also debated by some scientiststhe discovery brought brunet worldwide recognition in the field of paleoanthropology and in 2003 he was awarded the dan david prize a prize given to those whose achievements help better

1997 the college installed gundry in its first endowed faculty chair and soon afterwards established also the robert h gundry chair of biblical studies upon his retirement in 2000 the college made him professor emeritus and scholarinresidence since then he has been a frequent contributor to the periodical books and culturebesides many articles and reviews that have appeared in scholarly journals gundry has published major scholarly commentaries on the gospel of mark and the gospel of matthew the one on matthew caused a controversy that led to his resignation from the evangelical theological society ets at that societys request in 1983 voters favoring the request reckoned that the commentary was at odds with the societys affirmation of scriptural inerrancy using redaction criticism gundry argued that matthew tailored the story of jesus sometimes unhistorically to meet the needs of the gospels intended audience especially troubling to many in the ets was gundrys contention that matthew made unhistorical theologically motivated revisions of the infancy story in matthew 1 and matthew 2earlier gundry had been asked to furnish a commentary on matthew in the expositors bible commentary ebc a major evangelical series of commentaries published over the course of a decade or more in the 1970s and 1980s as each section was completed when he submitted his proposed commentary to frank gaebelein general editor of the series gaebelein pronounced the commentary acceptable but the subeditors merrill c tenney and james m boice objected to its use of redaction criticism gaebelein pronounced acceptable gundrys revised version as well but tenney and boice objected again so that d a carson of trinity evangelical divinity school was assigned to write on matthew this assignment caused a delay of several years in the publication of the ebcs volume on the synoptic gospels meanwhile eerdmans publishing company brought out a longer more technical version of gundrys workaccording to gundry his work does not call into question the inerrancy of the gospel of matthew he argues to the contrary that inerrancy must be considered in the twin lights of authorial intent and acceptable literary standards of the authors time and place and that matthew intentionally and acceptably treats us to history mixed with elements that cannot be called historical in a modern sense to be called inerrant then matthews gospel need not be measured against standards of modern historical writing by contrast says gundry luke states a historical purpose along lines that run closer to modern history writing these views were supported by a significant portion of the ets and after looking into the matter the societys executive committee cleared gundry but a campaign against him spearheaded by norman geisler resulted in the request that he resign against his critics gundry has contended that he treats biblical wording more seriously than they do when they construct strained harmonizations to maintain historicity at every point outside certain quarters of the ets his work is generally considered a model of conservative evangelicalismgundrys other published books include the use of the old testament in st matthews gospel based on his doctoral dissertation sma in biblical theology arguing for a physical meaning of body even in figurative usage and the old is better containing new and revised essays on various topics his two books the church and the tribulation and first the antichrist undermine the popular view that christians will be raptured out of the world prior to a coming
