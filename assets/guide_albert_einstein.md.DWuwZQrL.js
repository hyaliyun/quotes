I am only passionately curious.</p><p>&quot;Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits.

It is the preview of life&#39;s coming attractions.</p><p>&quot;Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone.&quot;</p><p>I am not only a pacifist but a militant pacifist. I am willing to fight for peace. Nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war.</p><p>One may say the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.</p><p>Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason mastery demands all of a person.</p><p>&quot;That deep emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.&quot;</p><p>Human beings must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.</p><p>The value of a man should be seen in what he gives and not in what he is able to receive.</p><p>We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive.</p><p>Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.</p><p>The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.</p><p>An empty stomach is not a good political adviser.</p><p>&quot;I very rarely think in words at all. A thought comes, and I may try to express it in words afterwards.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute.&quot;</p><p>Anger dwells only in the bosom of fools.</p><p>Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.</p><p>Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind.</p><p>&quot;He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice.&quot;</p><p>It is only to the individual that a soul is given.</p><p>It was the experience of mystery - even if mixed with fear - that engendered religion.</p><p>Joy in looking and comprehending is nature&#39;s most beautiful gift.</p><p>&quot;The faster you go, the shorter you are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Occurrences in this domain are beyond the reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation, not because of any lack of order in nature.&quot;</p><p>A question that sometimes drives me hazy: am I or are the others crazy?</p><p>&quot;I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best both for the body and the mind.&quot;</p><p>It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder.</p><p>There comes a time when the mind takes a higher plane of knowledge but can never prove how it got there.</p><p>&quot;As far as I&#39;m concerned, I prefer silent vice to ostentatious virtue.&quot;</p><p>Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.</p><p>I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil.</p><p>Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.</p><p>Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized.</p><p>Nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.</p><p>The pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to remain children all our lives.</p><p>Without deep reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people.</p><p>&quot;There is no logical way to the discovery of these elemental laws. There is only the way of intuition, which is helped by a feeling for the order lying behind the appearance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree.&quot;</p><p>Force always attracts men of low morality.</p><p>&quot;Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism - how passionately I hate them!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor.&quot;</p><p>It gives me great pleasure indeed to see the stubbornness of an incorrigible nonconformist warmly acclaimed.</p><p>Never lose a holy curiosity.</p><p>No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.</p><p>Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.</p><p>&quot;Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.&quot;</p><p>Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.</p><p>The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.</p><p>We still do not know one thousandth of one percent of what nature has revealed to us.</p><p>&quot;He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Morality is of the highest importance - but for us, not for God.&quot;</p><p>The only reason for time is so that everything doesn&#39;t happen at once.</p><p>God does not play dice.</p><p>I shall never believe that God plays dice with the world.</p><p>&quot;If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.&quot;</p><p>It stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome man&#39;s insecurity before himself and before nature.</p><p>Knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be.</p><p>Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one&#39;s living at it.</p><p>&quot;Solitude is painful when one is young, but delightful when one is more mature.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears, for there&#39;s no risk of accident for someone who&#39;s dead.&quot;</p><p>The hardest thing to understand in the world is the income tax.</p><p>&quot;True religion is real living; living with all one&#39;s soul, with all one&#39;s goodness and righteousness.&quot;</p><p>We can&#39;t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.</p><p>I am a deeply religious nonbeliever - this is a somewhat new kind of religion.</p><p>I never think of the future - it comes soon enough.</p><p>&quot;If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music.&quot;</p><p>Most people say that it is the intellect which makes a great scientist. They are wrong: it is character.</p><p>The gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.</p><p>The road to perdition has ever been accompanied by lip service to an ideal.</p><p>&quot;When the solution is simple, God is answering.&quot;</p><p>Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations.</p><p>Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.</p><p>The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms.</p><p>I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation and is but a reflection of human frailty.</p><p>The attempt to combine wisdom and power has only rarely been successful and then only for a short while.</p><p>&quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.&quot;</p><p>I used to go away for weeks in a state of confusion.</p><p>Small is the number of people who see with their eyes and think with their minds.</p><p>I want to know all Gods thoughts; all the rest are just details.</p><p>The devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life. Either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat.</p><p>&quot;The distinction between the past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.&quot;</p><p>Information is not knowledge.</p><p>&quot;Confusion of goals and perfection of means seems, in my opinion, to characterize our age.&quot;</p><p>It should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid.</p><p>&quot;All these primary impulses, not easily described in words, are the springs of man&#39;s actions.&quot;</p><p>Memory is deceptive because it is colored by today&#39;s events.</p><p>Mozart&#39;s music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a reflection of the inner beauty of the universe.</p><p>Never do anything against conscience even if the state demands it.</p><p>&quot;Politics is for the present, but an equation is for eternity.&quot;</p><p>You ask me if I keep a notebook to record my great ideas. I&#39;ve only ever had one.</p><p>There could be no fairer destiny for any physical theory than that it should point the way to a more comprehensive theory in which it lives on as a limiting case.</p><p>&quot;God may be subtle, but he isn&#39;t plain mean.&quot;</p><p>The release of atomic energy has not created a new problem. It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one.</p><p>One strength of the communist system of the East is that it has some of the character of a religion and inspires the emotions of a religion.</p><p>Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.</p><p>&quot;We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality.&quot;</p><p>I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.</p><p>You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.</p><p>&quot;Too many of us look upon Americans as dollar chasers. This is a cruel libel, even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the Americans themselves.&quot;</p><p>The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.</p><p>&quot;I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it.&quot;</p><p>It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely.</p><p>Isn&#39;t it strange that I who have written only unpopular books should be such a popular fellow?</p><p>&quot;In order to be an immaculate member of a flock of sheep, one must above all be a sheep oneself.&quot;</p><p>The high destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule.</p><p>People love chopping wood. In this activity one immediately sees results.</p><p>I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination.</p><p>God always takes the simplest way.</p><p>I have just got a new theory of eternity.</p><p>True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist.</p><p>&quot;We cannot despair of humanity, since we ourselves are human beings.&quot;</p><p>The man of science is a poor philosopher.</p><p>&quot;The process of scientific discovery is, in effect, a continual flight from wonder.&quot;</p>",180)]))}const m=t(a,[["render",s]]);export{c as __pageData,m as default};
