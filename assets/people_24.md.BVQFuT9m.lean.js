she filed suit with the high court in 1999 bypassing the syariah court islamic court she later filed suit with the federal court in 2006 joy hopes to live openly as a christian she was forced to go into hiding by the publicity surrounding her casein a majority verdict delivered on may 30 2007 the federal court rejected her appeal her appeal was dismissed 21 by chief justice tun ahmad fairuz sheikh abdul halim and datuk alauddin mohd sheriff the ruling stated that a person who wanted to renounce hisher religion must do so according to existing laws or practices of the particular religion only after the person has complied with the requirements and the authorities are satisfied that the person has apostatised can she embrace christianity in other words a person cannot at ones whims and fancies renounce or embrace a religionthe dissenting chief judge of sabah and sarawak datuk richard malanjum wrote that hence in my view this is tantamount to unequal treatment under the law in other words it is discriminatory and unconstitutional and should therefore be struck down for this reason alone the relief sought for by the appellant should be granted namely for a declaration that she is

has been creating recycled plastic sculptures for over 45 years she washes them and sorts them by color creating monochrome scenarios by merely interlocking the objects without glue support frames or paint she sometimes uses plastic covered wire to join the objects in order to make her statementsboulet recycles faithfully even her packing cases are discarded suitcases used rolling cabinets and pizza carrying cases many of her acrylic showcases are rejects from manufacturers aquariums terrariums andor other containers she finds at flea marketsboulet has received award from the canada council 1987 the quebec ministry of cultural affairs 1984 and the e t greenshields foundation 1981thomas frick of art in america reviewed her work in the january 1988 issue commenting that what strikes one most about boulaydubes constructions is their playfulness and their paradoxical formal and material purity so far as i can discern they entirely avoid any kind of irony or commentary that would limit their imaginative strengthother reviews includeone would belittle the artistic nature of boulay if all one focussed on was the politics the way she pieces her works together is sheer genius the singletoned towns of expression are breathtaking one cant help but be sucked in by their singularity and power still you can theorize all you want about boulay but it doesnt compare to seeing her works they may be interesting philosophical an political ideas but more importantly her work is art each piece is an enrapturing entity and screams to be seen even if you have no interest in the theory the singular purpose is worth it it is like taking a series of serious ideas and putting them in the context of a theme park fun yet thought provokingits easy to be suspicious of these collections of found objects and to question their artistic merit boulay makes it look too easy too pat but in a sense her work updates joseph cornells the naive american artist 190272 whocollected

horror who produces all this plastic garbage and who needs it stilleven as the artist suggests we ought to be more discerning consumersmany of her works address the problems of animal rights and global unity as well as environmental issues with an air of experience unmatched by most nouveauenvironmentalists the work of the artist demonstrates that humor and fantasy can suggest answers to

another kurd victim called yussef who alleges rape and talks of russian roulette and mock executionsnecatis original evidence given to translator lisa turkuman was seriously condensed and essentially faulty on the basis of this and an interview with the greek helsinki monitor in october 2001 amnesty recorded in its report of 2002 that necati changed his evidence he insists he did no such thing and indeed at the trial in 2004 the commander of the unit testified against his own men and seems to corroborate necatis story recently amnesty international secretariat admitted that the staff at the athens office had resigned and that they had perhaps relied too much on information about the case that had come from only one source indeed from the first television interview to tempo tv he gave in october 2001 when footage was intercut with scenes from basic instinct there seems to have been an effort to discredit necati when christodoulos the archbishop of athens was approached for help in 2003 he went on national television that evening to say all turks are barbarians christodoulos has never publicly condemned the rise in racist agitation and its apparent links with the greek orthodox churchthe mep bill miller wrote to the ministry of justice a few times and received no reply in over three years the greek embassy in london denied that any court case was taking place in 2004 and in

the teams bestever finish with 4th at the san marino grand prix which was boycotted by the majority of british teams while the rest of the year would be difficult jarier was instrumental in keeping the teams morale up following the death of riccardo paletti at the canadian grand prix the following year saw a full season with equipe ligier but after a good run at long beach ended with a collision with keke rosberg he seemed to lose hope and finished the season without pointsduring the 1983 season he became grossly unpopular with the other drivers due to his bad behavior as a back marker on the track during races at the 1983 austrian grand prix he made many drivers angry because of his blocking tactics as a back marker on lap 22 ferrari driver patrick tambay who had led the race from the start was held up by jarier for 2 corners the glatschkurve and the boschkurve as he was being held up tambays teammate rene arnoux was able to pass tambay on the approach to the texacoschikane by boxing tambay in behind jarier this also allowed brabham driver nelson piquet to come from 3rd to 2nd by nipping past tambay into the second of the two lefthanders which dropped tambay to 3rd and denied him the lead he had been preparing to retake from arnoux a furious tambay waved his fist at jarier when he finally did pass him bbc commentators murray walker and james hunt were appalled at jariers driving with hunt sayingjarier really is completely out of order he really shouldnt be allowed to drive in grand prix racing hes got a mental age of 10 in the first place and that was an absolutely disgraceful bit of driving for a driver of his experiencethe authorities have to crack down on driving like thathe should certainly receive a short suspension and for being himself he should receive a permanent suspensioneven the gentlemanly walker also made rare scathing comments on jariers driving he said in all my years as a commentator but certainly no driver i have to admit that was an awful and crass piece of driving by jarier at this point in the season in terms of his formula one status jarier was at the point of no returnfollowing this jarier retired from motorsport but was tempted back to drive in the porsche supercup in 1994 this led to several sports car drives winning the 1998 and 1999 french gt championships jarier introduced himself to a new generation by contributing major stunt work to the film ronin directed by john frankenheimer who also directed the 1966 classic grand prix"},{"author":"Jukka Jernvall","quote":"jukka jernvall born 1963 is a finnish evolutionary biologist in the field of evodevo research his research has centered on the interplay of ecology evolution and developmental biology especially of the mammalian dentition jernvall is currently academy professor at the institute of biotechnology university of helsinki he is also a research professor at stony brook university ny usajernvall received his phd in evolutionary biology in 1995 his thesis investigating the evolution and development of mammalian molar cusp patterns was supervised by irma thesleff and mikael fortelius this led to the description of enamel knot as molecular signaling centers in teeth he also discovered and coined the term secondary enamel knot previously overlooked signaling centers regulating tooth cusp development this discovery helped to mechanistically link molecular regulation of growth and differentiation to shape later jernvall has focused on the modelling of threedimensional dentition phenotypes he has studied why certain dentition patterns arise several times during the course of evolution while other patterns occur only rarely jernvalls team has developed several methods from computer modeling of organ development to threedimensional analysis of biological shape development and function current research ranges from mutant mice in the laboratory to evolutionary diversity in the fossil record and to the senescence
