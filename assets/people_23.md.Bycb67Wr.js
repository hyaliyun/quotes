contrary to a popular myth however this was not the primary reason for the change in javelin design rules that came into force starting in 1986 the relevant changes had already been officially proposed prior to hohns record throw not only to shorten distances but even more to get rid of the then frequent flat or ambiguous landings which often made it hard to assess if a throw should be declared legal most famously in the highprofile case at the 1980 summer olympics in moscow where the eventual winner dainis kla only progressed to the last three rounds with an apparently flat throw ambiguous landings were also much more difficult to measure accurately compared to clearly legal ones where the javelin would stick in the ground at the landing spot the record statistics therefore had to be restarted and the mark of uwe hohn became an eternal world record the current world record under the new rules is jan elezns 9848 m 323 ft 1 in set in 1996the gdr boycotted the 1984 olympic

billions to develop he made it clear to his handlers he wanted tremendous payments every time they had meetingsfor his attempted espionage cavanaugh was sentenced to life imprisonment while imprisoned he applied for and was granted parole as his conviction occurred before 1987 when parole was abolished for federal cases in 2001 thomas cavanaugh was released from prisoncavanaughs case has often been a study in security while the false flag operation was occurring the fbi agents impersonating soviet intelligence officers had to go to great lengths because of tight security practices at northrop so as not to alert cavanaugh cavanaugh claimed he could not make copies of classified documents as the copiers at his work were regulated by counters which meant the russians needed to bring a portable photocopier to their meeting point when asked to smuggle papers away from work cavanaugh expressed concern about that as security guards would check workers but he felt more confident in that as those checks were overt and infrequent cavanaugh may have said that but employees were checked every time they left the building briefcases backpacks purses etc were searched another security practice undertaken was inspection of the safes of workers to ensure that all classified material was safeguarded and that they were in possession of only what they were authorized to work on cavanaugh was subject to one of these random checks on the same day he was scheduled to meet with his supposed soviet handlers the inspector later recalled that cavanaugh seemed visibly nervous but could not recall why as he had had an a1 inspection and all was in proper order the underlying lesson was that although northrops security was above average it was not absolute the fbi was able to stop cavanaugh before he got to the soviets but a general sense of overconfidence in the northrop administration and no way it can happen here attitude was a vulnerability of which cavanaugh took advantagecavanaughs motivation to commit espionage fit into the common causes greed and job dissatisfaction were the main factors in a largely snap decision cavanaugh chose to sell secrets in an effort to retire his

1966in 1969 pearlman founded arp instruments inc originally tonus inc with 100000 of his own money and matching funds from a small group of investors the name arp was derived from pearlmans initials arp entered the fledgling synthesizer industry with the introduction of the 2500 analog modular synthesizer at the aes show in fall 1970 and subsequently competed headtohead with other leading synthesizer companies of the time pearlman eschewed patch cord methodology for interconnecting synthesizer modules designing instead a system of sliding matrix switches he also applied his opamp experience by utilizing dual transistors on a single integrated circuit to overcome temperature gradients and provide very stable oscillators more stable than other popular synthesizers on the market at the time namely offerings from moog music and buchlathe companys next synthesizer and one of its most popular and commercially successful was the arp 2600 the first units were manufactured in early 1971 in small quantities but by the end of the year the 2600p model was in full production eschewing some of the more esoteric modules from the 2500 the 2600 was conceived as both a musical instrument and a didactic tool for learning about electronic music instead of the 2500s unreliable and arcane pin matrix the 2600 used a more traditional patch cord routing architecture that provided users with a clear visual indication of signal flow the 2600 was produced from 1971 until 1980 the year that arp ceased to exist as a companyarp went public in 1973 based on the success of the 2600 and the arp

and evidence was found that during a trip he had shared a hotel bed with another man supposedly due to the unavailability of a twin bedded roomashby refused to name the other man concerned but later dr ciaran kilduff said that he would issue proceedings for libel saying i find it quite appalling that the press should feel able to publish such unfounded rumour and gossip in some cases making direct allegations against me and in other cases using insinuation and gossip i have never had a homosexual relationship with mr ashby ashby also said about the stories of his homosexuality i totally refute that i have been married 28 years so far as i am concerned i spent a holiday with a close friend we went to two hotels in the first one we managed to find twin beds and at the second one we

divorce and ancillary relief proceedings shortly thereafter ashby transferred his flat to kilduff with a purported short hold tenancy being granted to ashby which was broadly equivalent to the costs of maintaining the mortgage in consideration of the transfer kilduff paid ashbys liability to his solicitors of circa 20000 and also took over the mortgagekilduff and ashby parted in 2005 and kilduff proposed that ashby live in a third flat also owned by kilduff and pay expenses so that kilduff could live in both of the other downstairs and upstairs flats with his new partner ashby stated that he

psychological spectrum and its possibilities of expansion and transcendence on the canvas a collision of hyperrealism and technologically produced abstractions proposes an intersection where the organic self and the physical world must come to terms vasins work is vulnerable and visceral often relying on the grotesque in an attempt to encapsulate a moment and fuse it with the mind there are toilets phalli and insects all rendered with the reverence of a 17thcentury dutch still life painter this imagery along with selfportraits and iconic pop culture objects offer the viewer something familiar a point of entry into the picture and down the rabbit holeasking for and often provoking participation in the shared sensory perception of the human experience while the artworks are a place for connection they are also a visual anthology with a recurring index of computer generated forms plucked from the artists imagination concurrently questioning and reaffirming the idea of an archetypal universe the artists own body often becomes a frame of reference for a sentient existencethe intersection of its limitations mortality and its abilities creation are starting points in the
