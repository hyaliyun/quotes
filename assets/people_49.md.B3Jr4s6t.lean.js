friederich a von hayek in his law legislation and liberty to describe a political system without the state or bureaucracies and based instead on randomly selected groups of decision makers this has striking resemblances to classical democratic ideas as reported by thucydides in 2006 burnheim published a second edition with a new preface in which he directed the reader to an emphasis that a polity organised by negotiation between specialised authorities would work much better than one based on centralised authoritydemarchy as burnheim conceives it has two features that distinguish it from other proposals for selection by lot in politicsfirst an insistence on putting distinct policy areas under mutually independent authorities which would settle problems of coordination between them by negotiation or arbitration rather than by dictation from above the point of this is to remedy the defect of existing democracies in which issues are settled according to the power strategies of politicians rather than the merits of the casesecond that the committee in charge of each policy body should be statistically representative of those who are most substantially affected by their

change issues his 2008 book global feverin his 1996 book how brains think evolving intelligence then and now calvin writes as an advocate of the idea that brainbased darwinian processes are what provides brains with what are called consciousness and intelligence calvin starts with the harmless division of brain processes into two types those that depend on cerebral ruts hardware and those that dance more freely through the brain and so are able to function like software calvin usually calls these firing patternscalvins more audacious step in his research monograph the cerebral code comes when he suggests that the pattern of action potentials in any particular neocortical minicolumn can be replicated and spread through the cortex like a piece of software code and be played on the millions of other minicolumns in the same way one can play a million copies of a compact disc cd on a million cd players the key difference being that while all cd players are designed to do basically the same task the various cortical minicolumns can all have their own unique ruts and the copies of the firing patterns are not exact duplicatesthis allows for a cerebral symphony rather than just a millionfold amplification of the same tune and a survival of the fittest process whereby those firing patterns that resonate best with the existing pool of ruts will dominate ones consciousness and generate intelligent behavior our long train of connected thoughts is why our consciousness is so different from what came beforein writing about what mind will become in a brief history of the mind he notes we will likely shift gears again juggling more concepts and making decisions even faster imagining courses of action in greater depth ethics are possible only because of a human level of ability to speculate judge quality and modify our possible actions accordinglywilliam h calvin has advanced the view that use of the acheulean hand axe in hominids was a major factor in the evolution

began working with theoretical and computational chemical physics which is what he would deal with for the rest of his careerin his research dr leroy involves using quantum mechanical theory to understand and explain how properties of molecular systems are the results of forces of interaction by quantitatively determining those forces from measurements of various propertiesin almost any area of science today the experimental work runs parallel to the theoreticalwork and there is constant interplay between the two areas in canada there are severaltheorists whose research teams examine the

alaska in 1989 where she resides to this day lytle works in a variety of mediums this gives her the freedom to explore and discover new concepts by blending the techniques from the different stylesshe has always been intrigued with texture by drawing her inspiration from aged surfaces she studies and simplifies what she finds intriguing about the subject it could be the transformation of color brought on by time the interaction of the new textures and old or the way the peeled layers reveal their secrets through the expressiveness of abstract she is uses highly textured acrylics each piece has over a dozen layers of paint which is applied to a sculptural surface this causes the colors to shift and interact bringing depth and movement thinking outside the box lytle came across a different style of painting using acrylics she paints mostly in reverse on the back of 2 to 5 conservation grade acrylic sheets the images then show through the front some of the surfaces are then scraped burnt scored or sanded depending on the effect needed when assembled with space between all sheets are visible from the front this gives the viewer the opportunity to look into the piece like into the looking glass most of her subjects depict ice or water the result is engaging and different when it comes to drawing lytle likes the control of the photo realistic style her preferred mediums are charcoal pen ink and graphite her drawings often have so much detail that a single piece could take 2530 hours this of course is spread out over many days this style of drawing is so intense that she can only work for a couple hours at a time before having to move on to something a little less taxing but the finished piece reflects the time put into it and captures a moment in time pat lytle

issues that lie at the core of our current society postcolonial ideologies can be perceived on one of his most striking sculptures human library previously exhibited in paris and argentina human

including the material constraints experienced by contemporary artists in latin american cities like buenos aires it is worth mentioning that the work of grondona also points out to an ecological

thirteen she had choreographed the life of saint thyagaraja in the format of a varnam the most demanding of pieces in the bharatanatyam repertoire several such pieces of choreography followed even as she studied contemporary dance in parallel to her bharatanatyam training during this period she choreographed individual pieces and short thematic presentations though she wanted to leave calcutta for madras or chennai as it is called now in order to pursue dance seriously on finishing school her parents insisted on her completing an honors degree ba in english thanks to the frequent closures of

presented yashodhasomewhere along the way chitra dropped the concept of dancers dressing up in the aharya or costume in accordance with the character she he played for to suggest a character through

one of the founding editors of the leading journal evolution and development and has written several books on evolution including one on the origin of animal body plans he describes himself as a bit of a maverick who likes making connections across disciplinary boundaries arthur cites the three best books he has read as darwins 1859 on the origin of species darcy thompsons 1917 on growth and form and lancelot law whytes 1965 internal factors in evolutionamongst wallace arthurs earliest attempts at interdisciplinary conceptualisation was his 1987 book theories of life in which the influence of arthurs three favourite books amongst others can be seen in his 1987 book he attempted to unite conceptually the fields of genetics development and evolution in this work he addressed issues of relevance not only to evolutionary theory but also to the philosophy of science using evolutionary theory as the vehicle for this he posed the questions of what constitutes a scientific theory and how it is distinguished from hypotheses and laws one of the main distinctions between these different types of scientific idea is the degree of certainty attached to it a hypothesis is the least certain and is essentially a tentative answer to a particular question often put forward so that it can be tested experimentally arthur describes the hypothesis as being at the least certain end of a spectrum of scientific certaintyat the other end of the spectrum of certaintyuncertainty is the scientific law these sometimes come individually but more often in sets an example of the latter is provided by the laws of thermodynamics which are of central importance in physics and indeed in science as a whole the first law of thermodynamics is better known by its alternative title the law of conservation of energyto wallace arthur basically a law is a universally accepted generalization usually universal acceptance can be achieved in science only when very precise testing is both possible to conduct and positive in outcome when conducted and precise testing is possible only when the assertion to be tested takes a quantitative form thus in the certaintyuncertainty spectrum a hypothesis remains to be tested and a law has generally been rigorously tested arthur notes that the categorisation of theories is more problematicwhere does a theory fit in the answer is unfortunately that it can fit in almost anywhere and that its meaning is much more difficult to pin down than that of a hypothesis or law on the one hand theory can mean hypothesis as it does in the phrase its only a theory meaning that an idea has not been adequately tested or that it has not been tested at all on the other hand in the theory of evolution we are referring to a process evolution which is almost universally accepted within the presentday scientific community and thus has almost the certainty associated with a lawcontinuing on this theme arthur noted two dimensions in addition to certaintyuncertaintyhelpful in distinguishing between hypotheses theories and laws degree of quantitativeness most useful in distinguishing laws eg mendels from lawlike theories such as darwins breadth helps to separate hypotheses from laws and theories because the former are usually quite specific while the latter two are usually broadhe elaborates thus darwin and mendel were ultimately making statements broadly applicable to all species in the living world whereas the hypothesis that for example highfat diets cause heartattacks in man is of relatively narrow applicability and would not if proved to be true turn into a law or theory arthur notes that over time if a hypothesis progresses from untested to tested it cannot remain as a hypothesis if refuted it is simply a refuted hypothesis and disappears from the face of science if proved true it turns either into a theory or a law or if it is too specific and limited to be either a fact a particular diet known to cause heart conditions is a fact he notes also that according to the philosopher of science karl popper it is possible only do disprove a theory not to prove ita central theme to arthurs 1987 book is the morphogenetic tree which he expounds in chapter ten the missing theory of development arthurs morphogenetic tree essentially is not unlike an evolutionary tree and the resemblance may not be merely coincidental"},{"author":"Julia Volkova","quote":"yulia olegovna volkova russian born 20 february 1985 better known by the alternative spelling of julia is a russian singer recording artist and
