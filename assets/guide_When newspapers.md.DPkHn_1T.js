Those results are totally fake because they never include the promotion budget.</p><p>I wanted to write and direct movies and not be forced to adapt them from a bestselling book.</p><p>I&#39;m no longer dependent on the movie business to make a living. So if I want to make movies as other old guys would play golf, I can.</p><p>I&#39;ve been offered lots of movies. There&#39;s always some actor who&#39;s doing a project and would like to have me do it. But you look at the project and think, &#39;Gee, there are a lot of good directors who could do that.&#39; I&#39;d like to do something only I can do.</p><p>People feel the worst film I made was &#39;Jack.&#39; But to this day, when I get checks from old movies I&#39;ve made, &#39;Jack&#39; is one of the biggest ones. No one knows that. If people hate the movie, they hate the movie. I just wanted to work with Robin Williams.</p><p>I&#39;m not mad about movies, there are too many people involved in the making of them, and they lack a definitive creative focus.</p><p>I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn&#39;t want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn&#39;t have a choice. A talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work. It&#39;s funny because I&#39;d always known that I wanted a movie career. I just didn&#39;t think that I would be in the movies.</p><p>I like being in movies that have a great story. I&#39;m not so interested in being a Hollywood star. It&#39;s a job, you know. When you wake up at six in the morning every day for a week, it feels like hard work.</p><p>I mean, I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time. It&#39;s a unique thing to Hollywood that if you don&#39;t do that every time, then you&#39;re considered a failure. But it&#39;s like, &#39;Well, are you making movies to be successful? Or are you making movies to learn something?&#39;</p><p>It&#39;s not like I sit around watching my movies again and again, but I&#39;ve never quite believed actors when they say they don&#39;t watch themselves.</p><p>It&#39;s a funny thing: You want so badly for people to see what you do - you&#39;re proud of it - and I like the effect that movies have on people. But the attention can also make me uncomfortable.</p><p>Very often when I go in to meet for movies or pilots, I&#39;m put on videotape. I hate the notion that that tape is going to sit on a shelf and never get better.</p><p>I love movies that make me cry, because they&#39;re tapping into a real emotion in me, and I always think afterwards: how did they do that?</p><p>The reason I chose the movies that I did was based on where they were being filmed.</p><p>I mean, why am I considered an &#39;it girl?&#39; Because I&#39;m in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that. Because here&#39;s the thing with &#39;it girl&#39; status. It&#39;s great and amazing that anybody is saying that at all. But how long does that last?</p><p>It&#39;s like why people read scary books or go see scary movies. Because it creates a distance. They&#39;re scared, but they&#39;re not going to get hurt.</p><p>I wanted to be in Jim Carrey comedy movies before I met him. I wanted to be a comedian on Stage 19, yukking it up.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t like to be in movies. Movie people are strange. They live a different life than musicians do.</p><p>I love scary movies. I like blood and gore, and I love Halloween movies.</p><p>My movies just kind of sneak up on you. I don&#39;t have to worry too much about what everybody is going to say. Anyway, I really don&#39;t pay attention to what the world says about my movies. I just care about what my buddies think.</p><p>I&#39;m not looking to get away from anything. I like what I&#39;ve done. I like what I get to do and I enjoy working with my friends. I loved those movies, but this is incredible.</p><p>Kids end up seeing my movies anyway but some of the mothers get mad at me so I figured I&#39;d make one that I can&#39;t get yelled at for.</p><p>I like movies I can relate to.</p><p>I don&#39;t know many women who can relate to Sharon Stone and the kind of movies she does. I don&#39;t know a lot of guys who can relate to Tom Cruise&#39;s movies because they&#39;re on a kind of fantastic level.</p><p>There are some movies that I would like to forget, for the rest of my life. But even those movies teach me things.</p><p>I feel like a lot of the female relationships I see on TV or in movies are in some way free of the kind of jealousy and anxiety and posturing that has been such a huge part of my female friendships, which I hope lessens a little bit with age.</p><p>I spent all my time on my movies worried that people were eating and that the schedule was being kept, so to have experts in those areas giving me the brain space as a writer and director is huge.</p><p>Movies are movies, and I don&#39;t think any of them are going to hurt the moral fiber of America and all that nonsense.</p><p>I like the George Romero films, which were really great, social satire movies really twisted.</p><p>I love these movies where it&#39;s just about the film. You don&#39;t have my face on the poster. It&#39;s all about the movie. I like that.</p><p>It seems to me that one thing people do over and over again is try to figure out how to get married, stay married, fall in love, how to rekindle all this stuff. It seems to me to be a pretty eternal theme so I don&#39;t know if you can get typecast from making movies about men relating to women. It seems to be what is going on on the planet a lot.</p><p>The movies have got more corporate, they&#39;re making fewer movies in general, and those they are making are all $200-$300m tent-pole releases that eat up all the oxygen.</p><p>Usually I do everything reverse. I practice something in movies and then I try it in real life.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to produce anymore small or independent movies because it&#39;s just too hard these days.</p><p>I was never into the popular school or clique or anything. Then I started doing movies when I was in high school, so then I got popular. Then the girls paid attention to you who didn&#39;t before.</p><p>My dad had a commercial film company, so he had a videotape player before anyone. So he got Mel Brooks movies or Citizen Kane or some classic old movies. And every summer the revival house in Evanston would show the great films from the &#39;50s and &#39;60s and &#39;70s.</p><p>I think being self-referential is really narcissistic. Who&#39;s to say anybody&#39;s even thinking of you that much? But some of these movies that I&#39;ve done, people still recite lines to me, even 20 years later.</p><p>It&#39;s like those high-school yearbook photos that everyone would rather not see: Oh my God, look at that mullet hair. I have those photos too, but for me, they&#39;re, like, entire movies. And they show them on cable.</p><p>Most movies, once the action starts there&#39;s no more characters. You say a couple of dumb lines and then there&#39;s just explosions until the end.</p><p>Being alone is scarier than any boogey man and the reason why I don&#39;t choose to see Horror movies as a rule.</p><p>You go back to those films of the &#39;40s and &#39;50s and hear the dialogue, the way the people played off each other - the wordplay. I think we&#39;ve really lost that in movies.</p><p>I go off and make movies I come home, and I&#39;m a dad and I hang with my girls.</p><p>The financial implode is bound to be reflected in the movies that are being made, there&#39;s no question.</p><p>A huge part of acting in movies is appetite. You do your best work when you&#39;ve got a lot of appetite and you really want to embrace something. When you get tired, you don&#39;t have that hunger.</p><p>Obviously, I&#39;m attracted to heavier movies.</p><p>I want to be in movies that stand the test of time.</p><p>Ultimately, to have a career in movies, to a certain extent, certainly in England, you can&#39;t sustain a career in just English movies.</p><p>A lot of times you get credit for stuff in your movies you didn&#39;t intend to be there.</p><p>In the Rodgers and Hammerstein generation, popular hits came out of shows and movies.</p><p>You&#39;re creating new things in movies and people are going to steal them.</p><p>When you&#39;re making movies you&#39;ve got to get obsessive.</p><p>I guess you could say I&#39;ve been in my share of violent movies.</p><p>I was sick and tired of being an English actor who did a lot of American movies because I was cheap and good.</p><p>I always wanted to make movies.</p><p>If I wanted to make spy movies for the rest of my life, that would be one thing, but I don&#39;t want to just make spy movies.</p><p>Some people think literature is high culture and that it should only have a small readership. I don&#39;t think so... I have to compete with popular culture, including TV, magazines, movies and video games.</p><p>It&#39;s the contemporary woman that movies don&#39;t know what to do with, other than bathe her in a bridal glow in romantic comedies where both the romance and the comedy are artificial sweeteners.</p><p>People talk about mumblecore but I prefer bumblecore, hyper-realistic bee movies about how bees really are.</p><p>I have a great job writing for &#39;The Office,&#39; but, really, all television writers do is dream of one day writing movies. I&#39;ll put it this way: At the Oscars the most famous person in the room is, like, Angelina Jolie. At the Emmys the huge exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel. You get what I mean.</p><p>Woody Allen is really the ultimate. I love that he believed in himself enough to do what he did. And I have that same feeling - that there&#39;s nobody that looks like me in movies, nobody would cast me as a romantic lead, but I want to do it and I feel confident that I can.</p><p>I think these movies are as much for people of that time as for people who weren&#39;t born. For people who weren&#39;t born, they see how leaders must act under a crisis situation, not trying to be re-elected or not trying to check polls, that they go from their gut check.</p><p>I&#39;m not a film buff. I don&#39;t watch a lot of movies.</p><p>Growing up I didn&#39;t watch movies.</p><p>It&#39;s simple: You get a part. You play a part. You play it well. You do your work and you go home. And what is wonderful about movies is that once they&#39;re done, they belong to the people. Once you make it, it&#39;s what they see. That&#39;s where my head is at.</p><p>I tend to think of action movies as exuberant morality plays in which good triumphs over evil.</p><p>I made some truly awful movies. &#39;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&#39; was the worst. If you ever want someone to confess to murder just make him or her sit through that film. They will confess to anything after 15 minutes.</p><p>Now, if you are like me - if you are like practically anybody in America - then you probably hold some negative opinions about the French, based upon movies, rumors, recent headlines, unfortunate run-ins with Parisian waiters, or... you know... all that unpleasantness surrounding the Vichy regime.</p><p>Movies were never an art form, they were entertainment. It just evolved into an art form from there, and it&#39;s still evolving in different ways.</p><p>I&#39;m not impressed by someone&#39;s degree... I&#39;m impressed by them making movies.</p><p>I love horror, I love scary movies, I love thrillers. If things creep you out and spook you? I love it.</p><p>Although charismatic, James Dean is no Harrison Ford. In the majority of his movies, sooner or later he got the crap beaten out of him.</p><p>I think we&#39;re very complicated and we&#39;re capable of all kinds of things, and movies don&#39;t reflect that.</p><p>I think it&#39;s more interesting to see people who don&#39;t feel appropriately. I relate to that, because sometimes I don&#39;t feel anything at all for things I&#39;m supposed to, and other times I feel too much. It&#39;s not always like it is in the movies.</p><p>A lot of action movies today seem to have scenes that just lead up to the action.</p><p>How many movies do you see when you can say this director really knew what film he wanted to make? I can count them on the fingers of one hand.</p><p>I have three kids who like Harry Potter so I was sort of aware of it. You can&#39;t really move from it: it&#39;s on buses, in stores, it&#39;s everywhere. One of my kids has read the books the other two are too small but they like the movies.</p><p>The movies I watch and the music I listen to and the books I read - those are important to me. It&#39;s very important to me, and I don&#39;t know what I would do without those things.</p><p>We can now have action movies with two stars where one might be African American and one might be Asian American. One of them doesn&#39;t have to be white, and the other one doesn&#39;t have to be the ethnic sidekick. We&#39;re way over that. And I think it&#39;s happening in society, too.</p><p>I just knew that was what I wanted to do. I was going to perform as a singer I was going to perform as a dancer, and I was, you know, going to do movies and be an actress. I was going to do it or die trying. That&#39;s what my life was.</p><p>I feel I want to grow as an actress and be better. I want to progress as a singer and songwriter, and produce movies and everything. So there&#39;ll be no time when I feel I&#39;ve done it all.</p><p>No, but way before that, I&#39;ve been doing little dances in movies for years. Yeah, that was an amazing chance. You know, at my age to be able to do a music dance video, very unusual.</p><p>I&#39;ve made movies that we&#39;re very successful that we&#39;re a complete surprise, and I&#39;ve made movies that I thought we&#39;re going to be very successful that, you know.</p><p>My favorite characters are the ones that are the most successful movies.</p><p>I think that if I had grown up and had been in show business and the movies twenty five, thirty years earlier, I think I would have made a lot more musical movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve made three musical movies which is pretty good considering that not many are made but I was lucky in other ways. I came along when independent movies were starting to boom.</p><p>When videotape came so a lot of movies that I do have a kind of afterlife in video. Things where movies that I do would come and go they still come and go but you can go rent them and see them on TV.</p><p>I think if you do something effectively whether you&#39;re the lover or the comic or the action guy or the villain like I play movies are very expensive to make. Chances are you&#39;ll get asked to play that part again.</p><p>I have been in movies that I thought I wasn&#39;t very good in.</p><p>I make movies that nobody will see. I&#39;ve made movies that even I have never seen.</p><p>I used to be prettier than I am, but I think I look better now. I was a pretty boy. Particularly in my early movies. I don&#39;t like looking at them so much. There&#39;s a sort of pretty thing about me.</p><p>I&#39;ve made movies that I thought were good. I&#39;ve made movies that I thought were okay, but then I was very good. And sometimes you&#39;re in a movie and you think, I wish more people saw that - because you&#39;re good. And it just works out that the movie gets lost. But that&#39;s show business.</p><p>I aim for a lifetime full of movies.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why I don&#39;t watch a lot of movies I can barely keep up with the things my friends are in. There isn&#39;t enough time in life.</p><p>It was like in Samoa when they&#39;d put up a movie screen on the beach and show movies and the locals would run behind the sheet to see where the people went. It was pretty grim.</p><p>And being as I&#39;m somebody who loves movies like The Machinist, I also love going along to big mass entertainment movies. I get in the mood for all kinds of movies, and so I like to try each of them.</p><p>In terms of the romantic kind of lead, I just never enjoy those movies very much. Maybe they&#39;ll come to interest me more as I get older. I doubt it, but maybe. Romantic comedies tend to be, for me, an oxymoron.</p><p>There are movies that require fantasy and slightly more fantastical acting. Lines that are good for certain movies, in real life circumstances, would be absolutely unbelievable things to really say, and you would look at these people like they&#39;re freaks for conversing that way. But somehow for certain styles of movies, it works, and it seems fine.</p><p>I like the idea of movies having a magic element. How many times have you seen an actor in a movie who you know only as the character? It&#39;s wonderful, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>I don&#39;t get it when you get so much openness about the way movies are made, and the special effects and the behind-the-scenes stuff and all of that. I can&#39;t help but feel like this reduces it a little bit.</p><p>I always leave that for other people to decide, because some of the things I consider to be disasters are some people&#39;s favorite movies. And that&#39;s what I like so much, is that you never know. Something intrigues somebody and means nothing to somebody else.</p><p>I&#39;m so grateful for what Disney gave me and the experiences that I got, but at the end of the day, I can do so much more than what I did on that channel and in those movies.</p><p>I can&#39;t watch scary movies right now, because living on my own, it kind of freaks me out.</p><p>Where I live, nobody who&#39;s fourteen is having sex and doing major drugs. And I think if you see it in the movies, you may be influenced by it. I think it&#39;s so important to preserve your innocence.</p><p>There are movies where we are interested in seeing people&#39;s lives without agreeing with what they&#39;re doing.</p><p>I tend to make low-budget movies but, yeah, I make more money than I ever thought I would make.</p><p>The best movies have one sentence that they&#39;re exploring, a thesis, something that people can argue about over dinner afterward.</p><p>Being the son of a filmmaker, you are aware of a career as a director. You don&#39;t think of it as just movies, but as a life.</p><p>I want my movies to be audience experiences. As much as I like Michael Haneke, I&#39;m not going to make a Haneke film. That&#39;s just not in my DNA.</p><p>There are only so many movies you can direct. And yet there are movies that I want to make sure make it to the screen in as honest a way as possible.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to figure myself out through my movies. Whether it&#39;s big stuff like what we&#39;re doing here, or little stuff like, &#39;Why aren&#39;t I happier?&#39; With every film I feel like I&#39;m apologising for something. I feel I&#39;m most successful when I&#39;m looking for something that embarrasses me about my character that I&#39;d like to expose.</p><p>There certainly is no secret in that there are plenty of people who don&#39;t like plenty of my movies. Each one of my films is personal each one of my films is emotionally autobiographical. And I like directors who do that. With each one of my films, I&#39;m exploring one of my own issues and I try to expose myself a little in the film.</p><p>I hate movies that tell people what to think. I&#39;m proud that Democrats thought &#39;Thank You For Smoking&#39; was their film and Republicans thought it was theirs. I&#39;m proud that pro-choice people thought &#39;Juno&#39; was their film and pro-life people thought it was theirs.</p><p>I&#39;m not going to have a perfect career. It&#39;s better to be Billy Wilder and make lots of movies and have five or six great ones than to make so few movies that when you make a bad one it crushes you.</p><p>As far as writing, I like watching bad movies. Nothing stops me in my tracks more than watching a great film like &#39;The Godfather&#39; or &#39;Dog Day Afternoon&#39; or &#39;The Graduate.&#39; You watch one of those, and you never want to write again. Whereas with bad movies, it makes you think, If that counts, I certainly could write.</p><p>I think romance is a tool, comedy is a tool and drama is a tool. I really just want to tell stories that challenge the viewer, move people, make you laugh, perhaps push an idea about being open-minded but never settle on a genre or an opinion. I hate genre. I like movies that are original in their approach.</p><p>I hear the way people talk about the children of famous people. They&#39;re not treated very well. The presumptions are usually quite awful. So I tried to establish myself with a couple of movies. After &#39;Juno&#39; I thought: &#39;I think I&#39;ve defined myself enough as my own director that I&#39;d love to work with my father.&#39;</p><p>I&#39;m not Michael Moore. I think Michael Moore wants to tell you how to think. He wants to give you answers. I make movies to raise my own personal questions and not to give answers.</p><p>Well, Toronto, I consider to be the birthplace of my films. I&#39;ve made three films and this is the third one to premiere here in the same theater on the same day at the same time - they are my audience. They&#39;re the people that I think about while I&#39;m writing, directing, and editing. I specifically make movies for them.</p><p>I work constantly but I work at a lot of different things. You know, I run a theater company in New York, I direct plays, act in plays, in movies, so I try to keep it eclectic.</p><p>There are characters in movies who I call &#39;film characters.&#39; They don&#39;t exist in real life. They exist to play out a scenario. They can be in fantastic films, but they are not real characters what happens to them is not lifelike.</p><p>People used to be funny about approaching me, but now they seem to think I&#39;m as sane as anyone who&#39;s done what I&#39;ve done in movies can be.</p><p>You have to understand that crew members make movies so they&#39;re seeing a lot of actors all the time in their career acting.</p><p>What I like to do is just make good music, good movies, hopefully perform a good show full of energy and just have some fun.</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna abandon my identity as LL Cool J, but at the same time, I had to figure out how to let people know that I&#39;m really serious about making these movies.</p><p>The person that made me want to make movies, and the reason I do films, is Bruce Lee. He was an incredible actor, and he had a lot of charisma. Handsome, action, you know, everything was there. I loved Bruce Lee.</p><p>I play Xbox. I have a little boy to look after. I have dogs. You know, I have things to do. I would love to be able to sit down and watch something like a movie. I watch my own movies because I have to.</p><p>I&#39;ve turned down twentysomething million dollars for movies.</p><p>You make movies for the people. If critics happen to like them too, well, that&#39;s a home run.</p><p>When you go to the movies with your whole family, it&#39;s a different experience. For some reason, it&#39;s something that you&#39;re all doing together and you take away something special in that.</p><p>But then I go through long periods where I don&#39;t listen to things, usually when I&#39;m working. In between the records and in between the writing I suck up books and music and movies and anything I can find.</p><p>I remember looking through magazines or watching movies even just a couple of years ago and being like, &#39;I really want to be part of that,&#39; but not realizing what that was.</p><p>A lot of movies treat kids like idiots.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to make movies.</p><p>I think ever since I was preteen I wanted to direct movies and tell stories.</p><p>I want to make timeless movies.</p><p>When I started to watch some of the films I&#39;d done, I realized I was doing movies that I might not actually want to see.</p><p>Making movies is difficult and you get disorientated sometimes - even when you&#39;re working with fantastic talent.</p><p>I&#39;ve done many different movies in many different contexts.</p><p>Listen, I think movies serve many different purposes, from those movies that are frivolous and just an entertainment, to movies that just go to exploring the complexities of the human soul. Everything is valid if it&#39;s done with honesty and dignity, and I actually do both of those types of movies in my career.</p><p>I cry a lot, you know. Which is very difficult for a man to recognise, but I do. I cry in movies, you know, just watching movies.</p><p>There are some movies that I would like to forget, for the rest of my life - really! But even those movies that I&#39;d like to forget teach me things.</p><p>I remember being a kid and sleeping over at my friend&#39;s house and staying up late and watching &#39;Nosferatu.&#39; Vampire movies are supposed to be secret and bad. They should be rated R.</p><p>The nature of the movies is different than it was five years ago, and they&#39;re all driven by the possibilities of CGI, which means you can make anything happen on screen that you can possibly desire.</p><p>It&#39;s just as hard... staying happily married as it is doing movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve made over 20 movies, and 5 of them are good.</p><p>The nature of motion capture is only going to work for certain films. It&#39;s not going to put any other type of movies out of business.</p><p>I hadn&#39;t made a big-budget film, and in Hollywood there&#39;s a sort of man and boys situation. You&#39;re a man, you make $80 million movies! As if it&#39;s harder to make an $80 million movie. Well, I guess businesswise it is because you have more executives to argue with.</p><p>I think I took my eye off the ball. From about 2005, 2006, 2007, I was out of it. I thought I could oversee movies and have it done for me, so to speak.</p><p>I&#39;ve been involved with violent movies, and then I&#39;ve also said at a certain point, &#39;I can&#39;t take it anymore. Please cut it.&#39; You know, you&#39;ve got to respect the filmmaker, and it&#39;s a really tough issue.</p><p>We didn&#39;t care if we were well-liked as long as the movies were good. We served the movie - that was our master at Miramax. In our second incarnation, the movie is still the master but we&#39;re getting the same results in more subtle ways.</p><p>When we talk about Oscars, it&#39;s almost as a symbol of excellence, and the American public and the worldwide public accept that symbol. So, a movie like &#39;The Artist&#39; that costs $14 million, has to go out and compete with movies that cost $140 million. How does David deal with Goliath?</p><p>Last year, when &#39;Black Swan,&#39; &#39;True Grit&#39; and &#39;King&#39;s Speech&#39; all grossed over $100 million, it gave studios and independent financiers the confidence to make daring movies and not do the same old you-know-what.</p><p>My movies are important on an economic basis, on an artistic basis.</p><p>When people ask me what makes movies great, it&#39;s the material.</p><p>All my movies got screwed up because of my personality.</p><p>Over the years with movies, I&#39;ve given directors notes.</p><p>Audiences want to see intelligent movies.</p><p>You know, my movies are important on an economic basis, on an artistic basis.</p><p>I&#39;ve had such a great track record in making a huge profit when the movies are smaller.</p><p>All my life, I have loved and been inspired by French cinema, and as a studio head it has been my pride and joy to have the ability to bring movies to audiences around the world.</p><p>Well, I think one of the main things that you have to think about when acting in the movies is to try not to make the acting show.</p><p>I was so young, and making movies, going to the studio every morning at dawn was magic.</p><p>I&#39;m an actor. And I guess I&#39;ve done so many movies I&#39;ve achieved some high visibility. But a star? I guess I still think of myself as kind of a worker ant.</p><p>Movies are open doors, and at every door, I change character and life.</p><p>I just think old old movies, they make you concentrate and pay attention so much more. They feel so warm. A lot of modern digital videotape, it&#39;s just too bright. Don&#39;t know why, it&#39;s not warm.</p><p>I love huge movies. Not sure I am the guy to make them, but you can rely on me being there watching them.</p><p>Actors are steeped in a world of agents and where the next job is coming from and what are their expenses and what is the hotel like. You want to take them out of that world and dump them into another world, so that when you meet them on the screen they don&#39;t seem like the guy who was in two others movies that year.</p><p>I love watching the Bond movies obviously and I grew up reading the books as a kid. I&#39;ve always loved them because of that.</p><p>People say you never remember anybody who dies in movies, and it&#39;s true, you don&#39;t. You don&#39;t even remember people who disappear.</p><p>I like action movies, even though I think action movies are kind of derided now. But there is something extraordinary about action movies, which is absolutely linked to the invention of cinema and what cinema is and why we love it.</p><p>Movies about space raise those questions of what we&#39;re doing here, and that inevitably introduces a spiritual dimension.</p><p>All I do is go to the movies.</p><p>I like all of the mental, psychological thriller movies too. I enjoy horror movies across the board.</p><p>I would do anything for a part, nearly anything. Being in movies doesn&#39;t mean being pretty.</p><p>Critics can be harsh and I think it&#39;s going to take me a long time to make people see what I have inside of me and that I really put my guts into movies and that I&#39;m not superficial and that I&#39;m not just a pretty face.</p><p>I don&#39;t make movies thinking: &#39;Oh, this is going to be a huge box-office hit.&#39;</p><p>Sundance is weird. The movies are weird - you actually have to think about them when you watch them.</p><p>I like the good feeling movies.</p><p>I don&#39;t stop. It&#39;s my nature. People have to tell me to slow down. I plan on playing every role on Broadway. I want to do &#39;Evita.&#39; I want to do &#39;Sweeney Todd&#39; with Chris Colfer. We want to do &#39;Wicked.&#39; I&#39;ll be Elphaba and he wants to play &#39;Guy-linda.&#39; I want to do movies, make music. &#39;Glee&#39; is only the beginning.</p><p>I love John Waters. There&#39;s stuff in it that&#39;s beyond the boundaries of my taste, but his movies have always been like that.</p><p>I&#39;ll probably pursue doing more movies, but not horror or movies with killers in them. I&#39;ll try to stick to happy movies. I want to act and direct like Jodie Foster. I admire her because she went to college and she&#39;s still doing the same thing.</p><p>I want to make all kinds of movies. I do want to make big movies that are a lot of fun to go to, but I also want to make movies that are going to stimulate some thought and maybe raise some awareness.</p><p>I do like to move and get physical in my movies.</p><p>I&#39;m an enormous admirer of Christopher Lee. He&#39;s somebody, along with Vincent Price, who I celebrate, and I wanted my movies to show that celebration and that honoring of these great film stars that were unafraid to go into horror and Grand Guignol and the macabre.</p><p>I have eclectic tastes in the movies I want to do.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to just do independent movies and I don&#39;t want to just do adventure films. I enjoy both, and I think both are cogent.</p><p>I&#39;m the first to admit that I like going to, or my memories at least of going to Clint Eastwood movies or Charles Bronson or James Bond.</p><p>I may be alone in this, but I do sense the power of film, in that movies have the ability to literally change people&#39;s minds. That&#39;s pretty powerful stuff when you consider that.</p><p>I like fantasy. I like horror, science fiction because I can get avant-garde with those performances in those movies.</p><p>I care about the connection with the audience. Film is such a powerful medium. Movies can change the way people think.</p><p>I do enjoy animated movies.</p><p>You don&#39;t want to be photographed? You don&#39;t want to be known? Then you don&#39;t need to be out there peddling movies.</p><p>I haven&#39;t deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies. In fact, it&#39;s probably been quite the opposite. After the success of The Mask, I wasn&#39;t offered all that many blonde bombshell parts, to be honest. I think people believed from the beginning that I could actually walk and talk at the same time.</p><p>I actually think I have an audience member&#39;s sensibility about going to the movies.</p><p>I enjoy sports. I get a real joy from playing sports but I don&#39;t look for those movies. Oliver Stone wanted to know if I would do Any Given Sunday and it just didn&#39;t appeal to me.</p><p>I&#39;m proud of all the movies I&#39;ve made. They&#39;re not sequels, they&#39;re not franchises. And the reason I pick my films carefully is that I don&#39;t want to spit on my life. I like to think of myself as more than that.</p><p>When I make a film I&#39;m away from home for two to three months. So I want my kids to look at my films one day and say, I love his movies, I love his choices-because he loved them.</p><p>There are a lot of things that come to bear on movies now that I don&#39;t think are good for movies. They&#39;re trying to appeal to the biggest demographic and, when they do that, you sometimes flatten out.</p><p>I&#39;m glad movies aren&#39;t going to please everybody, they can&#39;t. But what they have to be is recognisable. I don&#39;t equate myself with a master painter, but I think you can recognise my films.</p><p>I like four-hour movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve never really broken this down before, but, in movies, you almost have no connection to fans. And if you do TV, you&#39;re kind of connected, but they know you as the TV name not your real name. If you do radio, there&#39;s more of a bond there. And then if you do a podcast it&#39;s like you&#39;re literally inside of your fans.</p><p>And I love Mel Brooks. My Dad loved his movies, too, they&#39;re awesome, the kind of thing that if you&#39;re in for ten minutes, you&#39;re in for two hours.</p><p>I mean, I kind of remember... I&#39;m 36 now, so it&#39;s kind of hard for me to relate to what it was like when I was 25, or 24, but I do remember a period in time when that&#39;s how I defined who I was, by the music I listened to and the movies I went to.</p><p>I do like escapism. I like going to the movies on a Friday night and seeing something fun.</p><p>I want to make movies that pierce people&#39;s hearts and touch them in some way, even if it&#39;s just for the night while they&#39;re in the cinema in that moment, I want to bring actual tears to their eyes and goosebumps to their skin.</p><p>When we shoot 24, there are so many things I have to worry about, from the script to technical things to my performance, that I don&#39;t have a second to be bored or take anything for granted. We produce 24 hours of film a season, which is like making 12 movies.</p><p>There are a lot of movies I&#39;d like to throw away. That&#39;s not to say that I went in with that attitude. Any film I ever started, I went in with all the hope and best intentions in the world, but some films just don&#39;t work.</p><p>I crave working on those small independent movies because I love going to see those myself.</p><p>Lord of the Rings was my first experience making movies and at the time, I had no ideas how movies were done. I thought that&#39;s the way they&#39;re done, so in a way, I had nothing to compare it to.</p><p>The truth is - I found myself doing these huge action-adventure movies, and um, and which are cool man. And I really love doing them. And thankfully I haven&#39;t had too much dialogue, because if I had I would have really made a mess of it. You know what I mean?</p><p>Yeah, I mean the material, directors, the other cast, and if you think you can do something with the character then you do it and go from there. I am looking forward to doing some smaller movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve done movies with a sword before. But I haven&#39;t really been given the full responsibility of something like a Ridley Scott film.</p><p>Movies like that aren&#39;t about the visual effects and explosions. They&#39;re human stories about family, about life, about death.</p><p>Just because you&#39;ve made a couple movies, you&#39;ve done some good movies, you&#39;ve been nominated for some Academy Awards, whatever, nobody&#39;s entitled. It&#39;s a business. If they don&#39;t see it, I can think they&#39;re wrong, but I&#39;m not entitled to a $15 million budget to make a film.</p><p>People wrestle sometimes making movies, and I think that conflict is a very essential thing. I think a lot of very happy productions have produced a lot of very banal movies.</p><p>I like making movies for myself and my friends and people with my sensibility.</p><p>I just love movies.</p><p>There&#39;s this index that tallies up how much your movies have made, and if they haven&#39;t grossed a certain amount, then you&#39;re not bankable. I know I&#39;m not Will Smith but, you know, my ranking&#39;s pretty low. The only studio picture I&#39;ve done is &#39;Zodiac,&#39; and that didn&#39;t perform that well.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t survive just doing independent movies. And I&#39;d rather do modelling than movies or TV I didn&#39;t like.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know what types of movies I wanted to do. I want to do things that are different. I want to take my time with each role.</p><p>I just want to keep doing what I&#39;m doing and hopefully people will watch my movies.</p><p>I grew up when I was 15 when I had my first opportunity in movies. I watched every great movie for a year and a half, and since then I&#39;ve asked myself how I can emulate such artistry. That&#39;s really my motivation. I want to do something as good as my heroes have done.</p><p>I like to think the movies that I&#39;ve picked have something worthwhile to say. Something relevant.</p><p>I loved old black and white movies, especially the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals. I loved everything about them - the songs, the music, the romance and the spectacle. They were real class and I knew that I wanted to be in that world.</p><p>I had a daughter who was 9 years old and I had the feeling I wasn&#39;t going to be a real parent if I didn&#39;t quit making movies for a while and spend time with her. I also felt that I&#39;d made enough movies and said what I had to say at the time.</p><p>And if people come up and say they like the movies you&#39;re in, it&#39;s a great compliment.</p><p>The thing about the UK is we don&#39;t really make that many great movies.</p><p>It&#39;s something I never dreamed I&#39;d be doing, making movies.</p><p>Jet was very busy. I&#39;ve been inspired by a lot of his movies.</p><p>Hollywood has the idea that movies have to be dumb. But especially movies for or about teenagers have to be really dumb!</p><p>I don&#39;t blame folks for not wanting to put me in their movies or whatever. I understand if their audiences had an association with me.</p><p>If the goal is to get the best artists, actors, and filmmakers in the world to create the best movies, Hollywood does a decent job. And I think no one would disagree with me that it also makes a ton of bad movies and employs a bunch of hacks.</p><p>Movies are different from real life.</p><p>I mean, movies in general tend to sort of portray time, space and identity as these very solid things. Time moves forward. Space is what it is. You are you, and you&#39;re always you.</p><p>Even today, in our progressive times, in most movies that come out, the men have to have biceps and the women have to be thin or something.</p><p>There&#39;s an absolute prejudice that good movies are dramas and comedies are more dismissable. But I couldn&#39;t disagree more.</p><p>I was a very interested arts student, I was always into that part of school and when I got into high school I went into architectural drafting. It gave me an understanding of how to build things and it&#39;s really helped me put things in perspective. With my music and my movies, to me it&#39;s all art.</p><p>A lot of people just go to movies that feed into their preexisting and not so noble needs and desires: They just go to action pictures, and things like that.</p><p>Class is often invisible in America in the movies, and usually not the subject of the film.</p><p>Movies absorb our attention more completely, I think.</p><p>The movies that are made more thoughtfully or made or with more ambition often get just get drowned out by the noise.</p><p>When my mother got home from work, she would take me to the movies. It was her way of getting out, and she would take me with her. I&#39;d go home and act all the parts. It had a tremendous influence on my becoming an actor.</p><p>It&#39;s never really that much fun for me to do movies anyway, because you - you know, you have to get up very early in the morning and you have to go in and you spend a lot of time waiting around.</p><p>My childhood was influenced by the roles my father played in his movies. Whether Abraham Lincoln or Tom Joad in the &#39;Grapes of Wrath,&#39; his characters communicated certain values which I try to carry with me to this day.</p><p>I remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the Navy. He didn&#39;t have to. He was older than other servicemen and had a family to support but he wanted to be a part of the fight against fascism, not just make movies about it. I admired this about him.</p><p>De Niro was a hero of mine. And Sean Penn. But I&#39;ve realized I can&#39;t operate at that level of intensity. That&#39;s okay for movies. On TV, when you live with horror day in and day out, you have to protect yourself.</p><p>I rarely see one of the &#39;summer blockbuster&#39; movies. I&#39;d like to see a stronger focus on smaller, smarter movies.</p><p>I took acting classes in college, and once I graduated, I decided to give acting a shot when I couldn&#39;t really think of anything else to do. It took me a couple of years to get an agent, and my first big break was The Fanelli Boys, which was a sitcom on NBC. Then I did a few television movies.</p><p>I was watching &#39;Up In The Air&#39; and I thought, &#39;Jesus, who&#39;s the old gray-haired guy?&#39; And it was me. I never wear makeup for movies and now it&#39;s starting to show.</p><p>The physical part of comedy is as hard as a lot of action movies. It scares me, but in a way that I like.</p><p>My passion is doing movies, and as long as I keep doing that, I&#39;ll be happy. I want to do movies, fun roles and dramatic ones. I love all of it.</p><p>My passion is doing movies, so as long as I keep doing that I will be happy.</p><p>I&#39;m fed up with the idiots... the ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who green-light the movies.</p><p>Reality TV looks more like America than movies do.</p><p>I&#39;m a weird big guy. Doing rapping, doing movies. Do a lot of stuff. But always do things the right way.</p><p>I&#39;ve played a lot of mothers in my movies.</p><p>There really are three types of &#39;religious&#39; movies: the ones that make fun of it, the ones that vilify it and the ones that literally preach to the converted.</p><p>I, for one, am tired of seeing movies about men damaging each other.</p><p>I am a filmmaker. That is all I&#39;ve ever been. You know, Martin Scorsese makes films about the mob. And I make movies about food.</p><p>Why be boring? Have some fun. Rock shows should be like movies: I don&#39;t go to a movie hoping it&#39;ll change my life.</p><p>Even if we die at 100, we&#39;re still dying young. I want at least 700 years. There&#39;s a lot of travelling and books to read and movies to see. I&#39;m not going to squeeze it all in in 85 years.</p><p>I&#39;m a big fan of vampire movies generally and that sort of tradition of characters.</p><p>Before I&#39;d written movies, I never could do big set-piece scenes with a lot of different speakers - when you&#39;ve got twelve people around a dinner table talking at cross purposes. I had always been impressed by other people&#39;s ability to do that.</p><p>My interest in film is sort of catholic - apart from science fiction and horror movies, I&#39;ll watch almost everything.</p><p>I definitely have found a balance. I&#39;ve had so many offers in the past to do different movies or different things and I always choose tournaments over it.</p><p>I love going to movies.</p><p>I grew up on Bette Davis movies, and Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe.</p><p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re living in great times for movies, to tell you the truth.</p><p>You have to get the audience invested even if you&#39;re doing something that they think is dumb, it&#39;s kind of what these movies are all about.</p><p>If you really want to be competitive in today&#39;s market you have to be in movies that make money.</p><p>And you also have to do movies that are about commerce because that&#39;s what is required of the industry today.</p><p>The movies people don&#39;t talk about or remember after six months&#39; time don&#39;t really matter.</p><p>Billions of people have seen and been influenced by movies in the short history of this industry.</p><p>Well, it was actually - I brought the idea of doing a documentary to HBO back in 2000, when there were some press reports sort of were bandied about that there were going to TV movies based on some of the books that were out.</p><p>I find that when you see somebody in the tabloids all the time, you have no desire to see them in movies.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure anybody&#39;s ready to see me in a drama. And loving movies so much, I&#39;ve seen a lot of comics try to make that transition too fast, and it can be detrimental. And I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had as much success as I need in the comedy genre to open up those opportunities.</p><p>There are a lot of movies I&#39;ve done that come and go, and don&#39;t really establish a growing fan base.</p><p>I don&#39;t generally do movies that get good reviews.</p><p>I was a total athlete. I loved sports, but when I realized I wasn&#39;t going to be a professional athlete, I realized I wanted to be in movies.</p><p>Working on the &#39;Ice Age&#39; movies, I&#39;m really proud to be in them.</p><p>The irony is that you can&#39;t use real rain to make movies.</p><p>My bar for being successful is being able to do movies that really mean something to me and being able to make a living off of that.</p><p>I can&#39;t do the same movies all my life. I&#39;m conscious of that. But it&#39;s a trade-off. &#39;Dear John&#39; allowed me to do movies I&#39;ve wanted to do. You learn to balance it out. I&#39;m still learning. Only now am I getting to do the kinds of movies that I have wanted to do. So it&#39;s a steady climb. You don&#39;t jump into a Soderbergh film.</p><p>I&#39;ve been on so many movies. Generally, I haven&#39;t gotten to be on the ground level. As of two years ago, in &#39;Dear John,&#39; I got to really be on the ground floor. I wasn&#39;t a producer. I felt like I put the work in, and I did have a lot of sway on what got fixed, reshoots, so on and so forth. It felt really good.</p><p>A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints&#39; was the first real actor-actor part I did, and I hope I to do more. Action movies are fun, but I&#39;d be happy not to do them if there are better roles.;Channing Tatum;movies 49655;In all the movies I&#39;m in love with someone in my head. There&#39;s always love in a film somewhere. It doesn&#39;t matter even if it&#39;s an action movie.;Channing Tatum;movies 49656;I was terrified to do &#39;G.I. Joe.&#39; I had no idea how to do one of those movies. I was kind of scared. You know, if one of those doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s a huge hit on your career. People are like, &#39;Well he couldn&#39;t make a $170 million movie work. I don&#39;t want him in my film.</p><p>I still think that movies are amazing I respect actors and directors.</p><p>The reason I keep making movies is I hate the last thing I did. I&#39;m trying to rectify my wrongs.</p><p>I don&#39;t really make movies because I want to see my face on a billboard or because I want to get good reviews or have a big box office. That doesn&#39;t really matter to me at all.</p><p>You see so many earnest characters in movies all the time, everyone has a purpose.</p><p>The only reason why I would like to be accepted? Because if your movies don&#39;t do well, after a while you don&#39;t get to make any more movies.</p><p>I happen to be interested in watching a face age. I like faces of women aging so it makes me personally quite sad. That&#39;s a beautiful gift from God. If people don&#39;t want to see that anymore then I won&#39;t be in anymore movies.</p><p>People pay to see movies with women looking beautiful, but I think there will be a place for me to play women looking my own age.</p><p>Awards were made in Hollywood, in whatever the time it was created. They&#39;re to promote each other&#39;s movies. You give me an award, I give you an award and people will believe that we are great movies and they&#39;ll go to see them. It&#39;s still the same.</p><p>Some quality performances and movies have a chance to be rewarded, but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a bible.</p><p>I don&#39;t really care where movies come from as long as they&#39;re worth making.</p><p>Now, there are so many movies, so many festivals, and so many awards going on, each judged with each other, like your work is worse than others and that&#39;s not fair. How can you tell what&#39;s best and what&#39;s worst from these awards? We&#39;re talking about art.</p><p>Bond is the longest-running franchise ever and there&#39;s a reason for that: they are action movies but they are also touched by current events without being political or too serious.</p><p>I&#39;m a fan of action movies.</p><p>I think what&#39;s dangerous about being an actor who does action movies is you think, &#39;Well, I can totally handle myself now.&#39; But if my opponent didn&#39;t know the other half of the routine, I don&#39;t know how well I&#39;d do.</p><p>I missed out on everything. Sometimes on the street I see teenagers hanging out and going to the movies, going to concerts, and I get so jealous.</p><p>I really don&#39;t like to do back-to-back movies. I concentrate on things at home. My family and school life are important to me. I try to do one movie a year.</p><p>Usually when you see females in movies, they feel like they have these metallic structures around them, they are caged in by male energy.</p><p>I think what a lot of action movies lose these days, especially the ones that deal with fantasy, is you stop caring at some point because you&#39;ve lost human scale.</p><p>With the CGI, suddenly there&#39;s a thousand enemies instead of six - the army goes off into the horizon. You don&#39;t need that. The audience loses its relationship with the threat on the screen. That&#39;s something that&#39;s consistently happening and it makes these movies like video games and that&#39;s a soulless enterprise. It&#39;s all kinetics without emotion.</p><p>If military movies were automatically successful we&#39;d make nothing but military movies. But seriously, patriotism is one thing that all Americans have in common.</p><p>I love vampire movies. I think they are sexy.</p><p>Yes, I&#39;m going to be the President of the United States. You know why? You think you can get chicks by being in the movies? You can really get chicks by being the President.</p><p>I kinda see my current position like this: Here&#39;s your five minutes in the toy store, so you gotta do all the good movies you can before &#39;Chuck Woolery&#39; rings the bell.</p><p>The one benefit of having done all kinds of movies as an actor is, you learn the pros and cons of being tempted to do a really big movie because it costs a lot of money.</p><p>You&#39;re basically the sum of all the experiences you&#39;ve ever had, and they&#39;re sort of shaken up in you and reproduced in the things you create, and that includes seeing movies.</p><p>Not that it entirely matters: There is a perception that all actors make their movies. A lot of people assume you&#39;re responsible. George Clooney told me actors get all of the blame and all the credit.</p><p>My movies are unadorned, they&#39;re not particularly fancy, I think they&#39;re kind of workmanlike in some ways, focusing on the writing and the acting.</p><p>I knew I had to get out of Boston and stop making movies there, at least for one movie, otherwise no one would ever consider me for a movie that took place south of Providence.</p><p>I&#39;ve never held myself up particularly high when I had movies that worked, and I never held myself all that low when I had failures.</p><p>You don&#39;t go to the movies to do historical research, unless it&#39;s historical research about the movies.</p><p>Making movies is a very different experience in a lot of ways. It&#39;s difficult when you&#39;re used to owning the copyright and having a landlord&#39;s possessory rights - I rent my plays to the companies that do them and, if I&#39;m upset, I can pull the play. But the only two directors I&#39;ve worked with are pretty great.</p><p>As much as I hate his movies, Oliver Stone has an aspiration I admire, and that is that he wants his art to be part of what makes and changes public policy and cultural practice.</p><p>I write plays and movies, I live and work at the borderline between word and image just as any cartoonist or illustrator does. I&#39;m not a pure writer. I use words as the score for kinetic imagistic representations.</p><p>I just love movies, so suddenly, you&#39;re political about movies, and that&#39;s dark. It&#39;s just not fun when something you love becomes calculated.</p><p>I always, always meant to be on stage. I only ended up even auditioning for television and movies because I was understudying a Turgenev play on Broadway and was so broke that, when I got a mini-series, I had to take it and was so ashamed because I was such a snob.</p><p>On radio and television, magazines and the movies, you can&#39;t tell what you&#39;re going to get. When you look at the comic page, you can usually depend on something acceptable by the entire family.</p><p>I really care about this stuff, I care about movies, and you just have to be strong and don&#39;t be stupid freedom of choice is a big responsibility, and I&#39;m lucky enough not to have to just take any movie to pay the rent, so there&#39;s no need to be greedy.</p><p>I love movies with spectacle but spectacle can be a performance, it doesn&#39;t have to be a creature.</p><p>I hope to make movies that are so small they don&#39;t need to make anything to be profitable.</p><p>I have nothing against 3-D in theory. But I&#39;ve also never run to the movies because something&#39;s in 3-D.</p><p>When I was a kid going into the movies, you weren&#39;t force-fed information everywhere you looked about what the movie was going to be.</p><p>When I was a little kid - and even still - I loved magic tricks. When I saw how movies got made - at least had a glimpse when I went on the Universal Studios tour with my grandfather, I remember feeling like this was another means by which I could do magic.</p><p>Making movies was more a reaction to not being chosen for sports. Other kids were out there playing at whatever I was off making something blow up and filming it, or making a mould of my sister&#39;s head using alginating plaster.</p><p>I don&#39;t see that many movies lately that are actually about something, that are trying to challenge something about the way that people interact.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m a fighter. I&#39;ve fought my whole life to get to where I&#39;m at. I like fight movies. When someone gets knocked down, I like to root for him to succeed.</p><p>I appreciate a slow-burn romance. In most movies, everyone is just tearing their clothes off in the first scene.</p><p>I really unfortunately don&#39;t have tons of hilarious Sundance stories, because really I am not the biggest fan of hanging out, but the reason why is because I never go see other people&#39;s movies and I think that&#39;s the way to do it.</p><p>I was influenced when I was younger by the cartoon movies that Disney put out, like Cinderella and what not. I watched those movies over and over when I was younger and the music is ingrained into my head. Nowadays, I&#39;m still humming the tunes. It taught me the fundamentals.</p><p>Movies these days have made killers into funny people. What&#39;s that all about? I&#39;ve got kids and family and friends, and I don&#39;t like bad things. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re funny, and it&#39;s irresponsible to make movies that don&#39;t show you how that&#39;s not good.</p><p>I&#39;m a movie nut. I go to the movies probably twice a week, and if I&#39;m not doing anything at night, I&#39;m usually watching a movie or two.</p><p>I think there&#39;s a vague sense out there that movies are becoming more and more unreal. I know I&#39;ve felt it.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been a movie guy, movies have been my thing. I love movies, all kinds of movies.</p><p>You know when Hollywood does a great big blockbuster that really wraps you up in a world, and lets you believe in extraordinary things that move you in some way, in an almost operatic sensibility? That to me is the most fun I have at the movies.</p><p>But in the back of my mind I&#39;ve always looked to the biggest-scale Hollywood movies. Because to me the most satisfying experience is of watching a movie, if it&#39;s done really well. And so that aspiration is always it for me, if I have the opportunity to do it.</p><p>To be honest, I don&#39;t enjoy watching movies much when I&#39;m working. They tend to fall apart on me a bit.</p><p>I go to the movies at least five times a week, and after a while everything becomes a blur to me.</p><p>But most good movies have a gun in them.</p><p>Well, getting behind the camera is something I&#39;ve always wanted to get involved with. Ever since I was doing movies like &#39;Zathura&#39; I was very interested in all the different jobs on set and kind of soaking all the information up like a sponge.</p><p>The way I look at it, movies are a different medium for storytelling than books.</p><p>I love doing roles and movies that are different from each other.</p><p>In all honesty I think that I&#39;ve had a very normal life, even though I&#39;ve been making movies since I was 9.</p><p>There&#39;s definitely a large fan base for the &#39;Twilight&#39; and &#39;Harry Potter&#39; movies that need their next fix.</p><p>I like simple things. I like to sneak in the theatre and watch movies. I&#39;m a movie buff.</p><p>If I did any movies I&#39;d have to take a break from singing, because I&#39;d want it to be really good.</p><p>Not everybody goes to movies to get their life changed.</p><p>The music led to the acting. But movies aren&#39;t something you can just will yourself into. Someone has to choose you, and you have to be quite fortunate to be chosen.</p><p>I quit doing the movies because the wrestling was going so good and was so on fire during the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, but I was getting all these movie scripts.</p><p>Shooting this one was kind of like a two month party, we would literally play music between takes, and other movies that were shooting on our lot would play hookey, come over and hang out and stuff. We had a great time.</p><p>Comedy. It was just huge in my house. Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness, Monty Python and all those James Bond movies were highly regarded.</p><p>I grew up in Toronto and as long as I can remember, as long as there was cable, even those old cable boxes that were wired to the TV, there have been Bollywood movies on Toronto TV.</p><p>I really don&#39;t have any solutions and I don&#39;t like movies that do.</p><p>I&#39;ve kind of come to the conclusion that what passes for realism in movies has nothing to do with reality and that my stuff is more realistic than that.</p><p>In a lot of movies, especially big studio ones, they&#39;re not constructed in any other way than to get people to like them and then tell their friends. It&#39;s a product.</p><p>I&#39;m very particular about the kind of music that I record and sing, and it would be the same way about the kind of movies that I would do.</p><p>Movies, as evidenced by a chorus of protesting and celebrating Americans, influence broader trends.</p><p>I&#39;m blessed to have cool roles in these big movies.</p><p>There&#39;s too much down time making movies. That leads to boredom. And that leads to trouble.</p><p>The trouble with movies as a business is that it&#39;s an art, and the trouble with movies as art is that it&#39;s a business.</p><p>I find that you learn from others. It&#39;s very much about watching TV and watching movies for me and grasping that way and watching other people act.</p><p>Most of the movies I saw growing up were viewed as totally disposable, fine for quick consumption, but they have survived 50 years and are still growing.</p><p>Live theater to me is much more free than the movies or television.</p><p>The only thing I can&#39;t do is hear. I can drive, I have a life with four kids, I work on TV, I do movies, so the deafness question, is it that they want to know because, what? Not sure.</p><p>All my movies, like Revenge, are under two hours.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t be happier about being a part of &#39;Hunger Games&#39; and to play Katniss. I have a huge responsibility to the fans of this incredible book and I don&#39;t take it lightly. I will give everything I have to these movies and to this role to make it worthy of Suzanne Collins&#39; masterpiece.</p><p>I never think it&#39;s right to chew gum in front of other people, but a lot of times I&#39;ll come in for a meeting chewing gum and I&#39;ll forget I&#39;m chewing it. Then you don&#39;t want to swallow it because it stays in your system for seven years or something, so I&#39;ve asked to throw it away. I&#39;ve started to wonder if that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t get certain movies.</p><p>I do believe that movies are subject to a million interpretations.</p><p>I&#39;m scared of scary movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to get into acting, ever since I was younger. I&#39;d put on shows for my family and run around play dress-up all the time. I think I was 4 when I told them I wanted to do movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve only been to high school on TV and in movies. I&#39;ve never actually been to high school.</p><p>I just feel like with independent movies... they&#39;re really free to do whatever they want. They&#39;re not afraid to make a statement about anything, and there&#39;s not a huge studio behind them making sure that everything is wholesome and politically correct and all that.</p><p>I really like Gwyneth Paltrow a lot, as far as her career, because I think she&#39;s done a lot of small movies but she&#39;s also done great, big movies, and she&#39;s a really great actress.</p><p>I love doing kind of more kiddish-oriented movies, but I also love doing adult things. And I think it&#39;s fun to do a mix.</p><p>I loved the movies and I wanted to be like Marilyn Monroe. I thought she was so glamorous and everyone seemed to love her. I wanted to be like that and I told everyone I would be the next Marilyn Monroe.</p><p>TV is so different from the movies. It takes a lot of stamina because you work such long hours. It is really challenging. You are learning the next day&#39;s lines while you are shooting today&#39;s scenes. I found courage I never realised I had. I hope to do more.</p><p>I think I made good movies.</p><p>I like movies that are about real people in real time with real problems.</p><p>I learned a lesson which I didn&#39;t heed: Don&#39;t put yourself in your movies. It&#39;s too much.</p><p>I went through this very serious Woody Allen phase in college and a little bit after college. I still see his movies.</p><p>I actually have a thing about proper nouns. They clang on my ear in a weird way when I hear them dropped into movies.</p><p>When I go to movies and I love the movie, it&#39;s because it feels like it articulated something about how we&#39;re living now, and also gives me some insight into my own life. I feel actually altered after having seen it.</p><p>A lot of times, we&#39;re just sold these movies that are really cynically conceived and marketed, and they just want you there opening weekend, before everybody finds out it&#39;s not so good.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have any ambition to produce big mainstream popcorn movies.</p><p>I&#39;m a sci-fi girl. If I can have anything in life, I&#39;d want tons of great science-fiction movies and stories. It&#39;s so progressive, beautiful, and imaginative.</p><p>I think as an American society, when we&#39;re paying too many taxes or dealing with war, we don&#39;t want to see sad things at the movies.</p><p>All through my life what I&#39;ve loved doing is watching movies. I love the escapism of film, I love stories. So it is incredible to be able to be in them as much as I am, to see them from the first stitch in a costume to the end product.</p><p>I like to play guitar, jam out, play the blues, go watch movies. I love movies.</p><p>I spent much of my later childhood and adolescence very, very involved and interested in art, and particularly in animated movies.</p><p>I have to say I regretted giving up animated movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve had the good fortune to have a much more diverse life than most people would, professional sports and television and news and movies.</p><p>I love crying at romantic movies like &#39;The Notebook.&#39; I&#39;m always bawling.</p><p>I filmed seven movies in 2011 and I think that was a mistake. I pushed myself too hard and I want to be able to come to work each day and give 100 percent. I guess I found out what my boundaries are.</p><p>I&#39;m into &#39;The Walking Dead,&#39; &#39;Shaun of the Dead,&#39; obviously, and I&#39;ve seen all the Romero movies. I am a classic zombie queen. And I love the White Walkers on &#39;Game of Thrones.&#39; Weirdly, it wasn&#39;t until pretty late in life that I found my entry point into horror films.</p><p>It&#39;s like, if you can&#39;t focus on a movie for 90 minutes without looking at your phone, then don&#39;t go to the movies! You&#39;ve got some issues, so you should probably stay home and work on those issues, and not distract everyone with lights, and sounds, oh my gosh, the tapping on the screens, it makes me crazy!</p><p>Sometimes I make very selfish choices like I did &#39;Once Upon A Time&#39; for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child. I&#39;ve done some movies because I would regret them if I didn&#39;t, but other projects I&#39;ve done because they&#39;ve scared me or if I felt I needed to do a big romantic comedy to help me professionally.</p><p>I don&#39;t even like watching sex scenes in movies. I have a slight prudish side to me.</p><p>The one regret I have about my own abortions is that they cost money that might otherwise have been spent on something more pleasurable, like taking the kids to movies and theme parks.</p><p>People called &#39;28 Days&#39; and &#39;28 Weeks&#39; zombie movies, and they&#39;re not! It&#39;s some sort of virus they&#39;re not dead.</p><p>All movies assault the viewer in one way or another.</p><p>The movies and the parts I&#39;m being offered are becoming better and better.</p><p>I always hated high-school shows and high-school movies, because they were always about the cool kids. It was always about dating and sex, and all the popular kids, and the good-looking kids. And the nerds were super-nerdy cartoons, with tape on their glasses. I never saw &#39;my people&#39; portrayed accurately.</p><p>Movies for adults sucked in the 1980s, and music for adults sucked even worse whether we&#39;re talking about Kathleen Turner flicks or Sting albums, the decade&#39;s non-teen culture has no staying power at all.</p><p>When I meet gay fans out and about, they&#39;re so great to talk to - and I&#39;m big on hugging, because I&#39;m from the Midwest. They&#39;re just so energetic and loving. I&#39;m proud to have those fans, and their support means a lot to me. I don&#39;t want just girls coming to my movies I want guys to come, too!</p><p>Immortals&#39; is all action. I love action movies. That&#39;s really where I want to spearhead my career.;Kellan Lutz;movies 49780;Even though I make those movies, I find myself wishing that more of those magic moments could happen in real life.;Jane Seymour;movies 49781;I really love the independent movies and I just think that sometimes when they throw a lot of money into it and a lot of special effects and a lot of stunts that you lose the connection, the human connection and I personally love movies that are about the human connection.;Jane Seymour;movies 49782;You know, Stephen says, in the movies no one ever goes to the bathroom. They shave, they brush their teeth. He goes right at this sort of funny taboo we have about the bathroom, and he turned it into this nightmare, you know, your worst fear of what&#39;s in there.;Lawrence Kasdan;movies 49783;The movies that made me want to make movies were action movies, and thrillers, and Kurosawa films, you know, where you have an opportunity every day to shoot it in an unusual way. I was looking for something like that.;Lawrence Kasdan;movies 49784;The kind of pace that you want to use in a Western - just to acknowledge the land in the distance that everyone has to travel, and the way things develop sort of slowly - it&#39;s almost the antithetical of what&#39;s currently going on in the movies, you know.;Lawrence Kasdan;movies 49785;I really liked Carrie a lot. That was one of Brian De Palma&#39;s best movies.;Lawrence Kasdan;movies 49786;I mean, the trouble with some of the kind of relationship movies I&#39;ve done, is there&#39;s only so many ways you can shoot a conversation. I was really tired of talking heads.;Lawrence Kasdan;movies 49787;I loved Alien, and I loved Carrie, and I loved The Exorcist - those were big movies for me. They were just brilliantly done, and unusual, and they all took horror to some new place.;Lawrence Kasdan;movies 49788;I haven&#39;t seen Clones, which has been during this period when I haven&#39;t seen much of anything, but I did see Phantom Menace, and see my feelings about it - see, first of all, I think that when you make a lot of movies, your attitude about the movies changes.;Lawrence Kasdan;movies 49789;I didn&#39;t really want to do another sequel. I go to those movies, and I just sort of enjoy them like a viewer.;Lawrence Kasdan;movies 49790;For me, relationships are the real action movies. Bombs are exploding every day and the kitchen is Ground Zero.;Michelle Williams;movies 49791;I mean, look, I love movies, not just the ones I make... In fact, I don&#39;t like the movies I make very much.;Alexander Payne;movies 49792;Each one of my movies becomes easier to get off the ground.;Alexander Payne;movies 49793;The novel succeeds on terms exclusive to literature. A good film succeeds on terms exclusive to the cinema. That&#39;s why so many bad novels can become good movies, like &#39;Jaws&#39; or &#39;The Godfather.</p><p>I guess maybe I try to make movies that are closer to real life than are many Hollywood movies. But I still try to stay within a commercial narrative, a contemporary American vernacular.</p><p>It&#39;s so great in Hollywood now. You have people past 40 sitting and talking about serious stuff, writing and making movies and TV, but there&#39;s laser pistols and superheroes and alien monsters involved. It&#39;s viable and mainstream.</p><p>My fans mean everything to me - especially the sisters! When you&#39;re on &#39;The View&#39; or you&#39;re doing movies and stuff, you&#39;re a little bit insulated. It means so much to me when a woman comes up to me and says, &#39;Sherri, you said what I feel.&#39; That just means so much to me to know that I have that support.</p><p>I&#39;ll tell you what I really enjoy. We all go to the movies, we all watch television, we know what they&#39;re about, how they work. When the main character is a cop or a spy, it&#39;s very exciting, but I also very much enjoy when the main characters are nobodies - a trucker.</p><p>I like making sci-fi movies because I like watching sci-fi movies. I like watching horror. I like being in a horror movie. I&#39;m a fan. My perspective&#39;s a little different just because I get to participate as well as spectate.</p><p>I have a trophy case that contains all the action figures ever made of me. It also has items I&#39;ve stolen from my movies, like three guns and holsters from &#39;Serenity&#39;.</p><p>I&#39;ve always fantasized about being on TV. And I was. Then I fantasized about being in the movies. What could be better than captain of a space ship? I get to ride horses, shoot guns, have adventures.</p><p>For movies to get greenlit solely based on the success of other movies that have a lot of women in them? It&#39;s so ridiculous to me.</p><p>I do sort of gravitate towards smaller, indie-type movies.</p><p>I think people like to see the lives of artists that are legends. They always go through the dark periods and I think just as humans we like to see that and them coming out of it. I love those kinds of movies.</p><p>When you&#39;re on your deathbed, you probably aren&#39;t counting the movies you&#39;ve made.</p><p>I don&#39;t rehearse a lot. I try to keep it organic. Even in movies, the less I rehearse, the better I am.</p><p>I don&#39;t like doing movies, period. Movies are hard. I like TV.</p><p>I don&#39;t think people have been able to deal with the fact that African American filmmakers can make movies about life and relationships.</p><p>I have personal beliefs and they are sometimes reflected in the movies I make, but I also reflect other points of view.</p><p>I enjoy about 1 out of 100 movies, it&#39;s about the same proportion to books published that I care to read.</p><p>The long and short of it is that I am now in a position in England to green light movies, and that&#39;s really excellent - not high-budget movies, but movies none the less.</p><p>I had seen movies before that that had made me laugh, but I had never seen anything even remotely close to as funny as Richard Pryor was, just standing there talking.</p><p>I&#39;m also doing constant book readings, movies. You name it, I&#39;m doing it.</p><p>I was at the end of the studio system so when I walked into movies, I had a magnificent suite in which I had a living room and a kitchen and a complete makeup room. I had everything just for me. With the independents, you&#39;re kind of roughing it, literally.</p><p>I could really use a corporate sponsor. People think that because you&#39;re in the movies, you&#39;re rich. I have allocated all my resources to Shambala so the animals will always be safe.</p><p>So I do have to work, you know, and I find as many movies and TV shows that I can, because otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have an income.</p><p>I don&#39;t enjoy movies in 3D. I find I can&#39;t engage with the story as well.</p><p>I&#39;ve been asked to do action-oriented movies in the past and they just haven&#39;t been right for me.</p><p>I like high impact movies.</p><p>Here&#39;s the thing about movies, all movies end up on television. That&#39;s their life. Whether you like it or not, I don&#39;t care how much money you spend on it, or how big or broad the film is, or who the actors are in it, eventually it&#39;s all coming out of the box.</p><p>If you&#39;re working on a movie, you want it to be projected on the largest tapestry possible, and the sound to be perfect, and for that kind of communal experience of the movies to take place for it.</p><p>Audiences don&#39;t ever disappoint me, in the sense that movies I feel really good about, they usually feel really good about too.</p><p>Little Miss Sunshine&#39; snowballed. It was a tiny movie. We shot it in 30 days, and it was really fun to do, but it was one of those small movies that you don&#39;t hold out huge hope for.;Greg Kinnear;movies 49823;I think America becomes more disgruntled by going to the movies and having an endlessly good time at them.;Fiona Shaw;movies 49824;Movies have to handle time very efficiently. They&#39;re about stringing scenes together in the present. Novels aren&#39;t necessarily about that.;Richard Russo;movies 49825;I want to be around for a long time, singing and making albums and movies.;Jennifer Hudson;movies 49826;For some reason and I don&#39;t know why, but I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m funny in California. So I always want to do my movies east somewhere.;Kevin James;movies 49827;I want to do movies that I&#39;m proud of where my kids, at some point, can see and I can feel comfortable sitting there watching it with them. And just that move people. That make people feel a little bit better about themselves when they leave the theatre.;Kevin James;movies 49828;I&#39;m fighting the label of &#39;Black&#39; actress simply because it&#39;s very limiting in people&#39;s eyes, especially people who are making movies.;Whoopi Goldberg;movies 49829;I was in television drama, which is a first cousin to the movies, and I trust myself to make the right decisions.;Lee Child;movies 49830;One of the reasons why people - particularly young people - love action movies is because what they are really looking for is justice.;Steven Seagal;movies 49831;People go to the movies to watch a film and all they&#39;re thinking about is the actress&#39;s cellulite they saw in a magazine.;Robert Carlyle;movies 49832;I love making movies and hope to write my own screenplay someday and do some producing and be behind-the-scenes as well.;Victoria Justice;movies 49833;I don&#39;t direct movies for a living.;Tommy Lee Jones;movies 49834;I would be too selfish if I said everyone should see my movies more than once. To say that would mean I&#39;m just marketing my work!;Abbas Kiarostami;movies 49835;I have worked on very good movies that have been buried, and I&#39;ve worked on some resounding mediocrities that have been paraded through the marketplace like they were masterpieces.;Tommy Lee Jones;movies 49836;Some movies bring out the creativity in you. Every single audience member can become creative in the face of a particular movie. If you happen to like my films, it&#39;s because my films provide a bed for you on which you can find your creativity. The Hollywood movies do not provide that for you.;Abbas Kiarostami;movies 49837;I&#39;ve made some bad movies. And I really enjoyed it!;Tommy Lee Jones;movies 49838;I want to make movies about my country from my point of view.;Tommy Lee Jones;movies 49839;I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don&#39;t know... one of my favorite movies is &#39;The Notebook&#39; so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It&#39;s about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.;Taylor Lautner;movies 49840;It&#39;s always uncomfortable for me when I take off my shirt. No one else is taking their shift off. Why is everyone else in these movies bundled up in layers of clothing and I&#39;m taking my clothes off all the time?;Taylor Lautner;movies 49841;It&#39;s too expensive, that&#39;s the thing nobody wants to talk about. It is too expensive to make movies. That&#39;s not true, it is too expensive to market movies. Making movies is not.;Kevin Smith;movies 49842;You know, comics and movies, even if you take a comic and turn it into a movie, we can&#39;t all be Joss Whedon.;Kevin Smith;movies 49843;So I know how I watch movies which is on my laptop, man. And that&#39;s how I suspect a lot of people do it.;Kevin Smith;movies 49844;I&#39;d see movies, comedies, and I loved &#39;Animal House&#39;, I loved all the John Hughes stuff, but I never saw me and my friends totally represented.;Kevin Smith;movies 49845;In anything I&#39;ve ever written, all the characters sound like me, which I don&#39;t think is a bad thing. It makes sense. But I had always admired filmmakers who made movies that didn&#39;t sound like them at all.;Kevin Smith;movies 49846;Other filmmakers make their movies and put them out and that&#39;s that. For me, for some odd reason, it goes deeper than that.;Kevin Smith;movies 49847;I didn&#39;t get into this so I could talk about my work, my movies. You become an actor to act.;Kevin Bacon;movies 49848;I don&#39;t watch the movies I make, so I haven&#39;t seen &#39;Footloose&#39; since it came out. You see this young, hungry actor, it&#39;s pretty fun. I was the only one they screen tested. It was an attempt by the director and producer to talk the head of the studio into hiring me because they didn&#39;t want me.;Kevin Bacon;movies 49849;I&#39;ll be honest with you. My kids don&#39;t watch my movies and never have. I can maybe name a film one hand that they&#39;ve seen, actually, all the way through.;Kevin Bacon;movies 49850;Music in movies is all about dissonance and consonance, tension and release.;Quincy Jones;movies 49851;I honestly don&#39;t love the Cheech and Chong movies, I&#39;ve got to say.;Seth Rogen;movies 49852;Luckily, I think, I never really wanted to be famous, I just wanted to make movies.;Seth Rogen;movies 49853;I don&#39;t make the best movies in the world, but at times, I do feel like I&#39;m adding something to the cinematic community.;Seth Rogen;movies 49854;I&#39;ve seen a lot of movies get made where no one has control. No one likes it.;Seth Rogen;movies 49855;I&#39;m not one of those actors where filmmakers that I admire ask me to be in their movies. I meet them at parties and they&#39;re nice to me, but they never ask me to work with them.;Seth Rogen;movies 49856;Trying to constantly get yourself into movies is extremely stressful and sometimes just impossible.;Seth Rogen;movies 49857;Frank is such a great visual storyteller, that if you study his artwork you see that his Sin City books are already the best movies never seen on the big screen.;Robert Rodriguez;movies 49858;I always wanted to be a stay-at-home dad making art, making movies.;Robert Rodriguez;movies 49859;I do like strong women in my movies. I have five sisters, so I&#39;ve just grown up with that model.;Robert Rodriguez;movies 49860;I was a cartoonist when I was at university, but I decided to go into movie making knowing that I could still draw by doing movies, design work, story boards, and such.;Robert Rodriguez;movies 49861;It&#39;s difficult to do a genre film well, and it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re talking vampire movies or &#39;Dawn of the Dead&#39; or &#39;The Thing&#39; or &#39;Escape From New York.&#39; Those kind of movies, they understand what the old-school B-movie is supposed to be, they get the throwback of it.;Ethan Hawke;movies 49862;If I do three movies in a year, I don&#39;t feel like acting ever again.;Ethan Hawke;movies 49863;Right now, if you&#39;re interested in being a dramatic actor, they&#39;re not making that many just regular dramas. Movies have to have some other thing going on.;Ethan Hawke;movies 49864;I don&#39;t know what has happened to movies, but lately every movie is at least 20 minutes too long. It used to be that if you were three hours long it was because it was epic - a movie about Gandhi something with very important subject matters.;Ethan Hawke;movies 49865;If you&#39;re not a real chameleon of an actor and if you&#39;re not one of those guys who can really shape-change themselves all the time, one of the ways to keep pushing yourself and keep changing is to be in different kinds of movies.;Ethan Hawke;movies 49866;I don&#39;t want to imitate life in movies I want to represent it. And in that representation, you use the colors you feel, and sometimes they are fake colors. But always it&#39;s to show one emotion.;Pedro Almodovar;movies 49867;Most movies suck, even the independent ones. Hollywood is like baseball: Hit three good ones out of 10 and you&#39;re a Hall of Famer.;Denis Leary;movies 49868;For horror movies, color is reassuring because, at least in older films, it adds to the fakey-ness.;Lynda Barry;movies 49869;I think everyone who makes movies should be forced to do television. Because you have to finish. You have to get it done, and there are a lot of decisions made just for the sake of making decisions. You do something because it&#39;s efficient and because it gets the story told and it connects to the audience.;Joss Whedon;movies 49870;We were raised without movies, theater or music. We had only nature, the hills, the trees. When I got on the set of &#39;Manon,&#39; I wasn&#39;t star-struck because I didn&#39;t know what a star was.;Emmanuelle Beart;movies 49871;I don&#39;t always see my movies right away. And there are some I haven&#39;t seen at all. Sometimes that bothers the directors, so I&#39;m obliged to see them.;Emmanuelle Beart;movies 49872;I&#39;m sure a bunch of 15-year-old kids would way rather I do &#39;Superbad 2&#39; than &#39;Moneyball.&#39; But I would love to do movies like &#39;Superbad&#39; and movies like &#39;Moneyball.</p><p>I just like to act and write and produce. To me, making movies is the ultimate goal.</p><p>Besides the fact that I make movies, there&#39;s nothing interesting about my life at all, unfortunately.</p><p>Once you make a movie like &#39;Superbad,&#39; when it&#39;s popular and you&#39;re the lead, you get offered all kinds of things and there&#39;s a temptation to make bad movies either for the money or to maintain your relevance in pop culture.</p><p>All my friends were in college when I was making &#39;Superbad.&#39; We were drinking beer and watching movies and eating pizza. It wasn&#39;t like I was going to nice restaurants or anything like that, and I lived like a frat guy. Eventually it was time to grow up, be healthy and be responsible. You can&#39;t live like a kid forever, you know?</p><p>I think our culture has gotten so skewed. People assume that because you&#39;re an actor you want to write a book to exploit your celebrity, but my celebrity is only a byproduct of me making movies. I have no intention of being a celebrity.</p><p>Look, at the same time that I don&#39;t want to be a celebrity, I understand that when you make movies you put yourself out in the public eye. I&#39;d be a baby and a fool to be like, &#39;Why are there cameras taking pictures of me?&#39; when I&#39;m on a billboard for a movie. I think that&#39;s a very absurd concept.</p><p>I&#39;m really proud of &#39;Moneyball.&#39; To me, it&#39;s about feeling pride in a movie I made. I think when I&#39;m an old man I&#39;ll be able to show it to my grandkids with pride. That&#39;s all I can really go for: making movies to please me.</p><p>I love it, man I&#39;m 23 years old and I&#39;m lucky enough to write movies as a job! I just feel really blessed and can&#39;t believe it&#39;s happening.</p><p>People are always wondering if I am an artist or political activist or politician. Maybe I&#39;ll just clearly tell you: Whatever I do is not art. Let&#39;s say it is just objects or materials, movies or writing, but not art, OK?</p><p>I like movies about failing.</p><p>Movies are an expensive business.</p><p>In movies and in television the robots are always evil. I guess I am not into the whole brooding cyberpunk dystopia thing.</p><p>I cast unusual people in my movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been in the middle of making my own movies, so taking acting jobs that take me away from that has been impossible.</p><p>By the way, movies are like sporting events in that you&#39;re as good as the movie you&#39;re in. You can sit in a room for 20 years and go do a movie and you can just kill in it and you move to the head of the line again. By the same token, you can do five movies a year and if they&#39;re dreck, it&#39;s nothing.</p><p>Listen, there are some movies that are set in stone and the writer or the director does not want to change, but I&#39;ve never worked on a movie, including my own, that didn&#39;t take advantage of a rehearsal process.</p><p>I&#39;ve done performances in movies that I was immensely proud of and the movies didn&#39;t take off like a rocket at Cape Canaveral, it didn&#39;t take off.</p><p>My mom was a professional. My dad and mom met each other in a movie called &#39;New Faces of 1937.&#39; My mom went under the name Thelma Leeds, and she did a few movies, and she was really a great singer, and when she married my dad and started to have a family, she sang at parties.</p><p>I got into film-making because I was interested in making entertaining movies, which I felt there was a lack of.</p><p>What I liked about American movies when I was a kid was that they&#39;re sort of larger than life and I think I&#39;m still suffering from that reaction.</p><p>I&#39;m just happy to be a film where for once I don&#39;t have to worry about my hair, because my managers are always complaining about my hair looking depressing in my movies. Which is true. I mean, it&#39;s true.</p><p>Movies are movies: they take you back in time, and how it still is for some.</p><p>I was always attracted to science fiction movies.</p><p>I watch and listen to movies today and am shocked by the way actors deliver their lines. Everybody mumbles now and I don&#39;t understand why.</p><p>Making movies is just like betting on horses at the racetrack.</p><p>It just proves good movies don&#39;t need 100 million dollars to be good.</p><p>Why should you have to atone for making big movies?</p><p>In terms of number of movies, I&#39;ve been in an extraordinary amount. If you count only the minutes I&#39;m onscreen, it&#39;s not so long.</p><p>I&#39;ve found that if you wear a beret, people think you&#39;re either a cabdriver or a producer of dirty movies.</p><p>I never read. The paper or anything. I watch a lot of movies, and TV series and stuff. But I never, never read.</p><p>In live action movies, you just hope that everything works. Because the actor may had a bad morning and doesn&#39;t play good, or accidents happen continuously. Many things contradict what you are trying to say. But in cartoons, nothing contradict what you want to say.</p><p>John Barry was my hero when I was about 13. His scores to the James Bond movies were the scores of my life back then.</p><p>Well, look at all of these summer blockbusters. You can&#39;t help but laugh a little, because you&#39;ve already seen a lot of these movies 482 times.</p><p>You can figure out who you were by which movies you loved when.</p><p>I like being in kids&#39; movies, and I like being in family movies.</p><p>The movies were custard compared to politics.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen little pieces of &#39;Interview with a Vampire&#39; when it was on TV, but I kind of always go yuck! I don&#39;t watch R-rated movies, so that really cuts down on a lot of the horror.</p><p>I look at myself as an audience member. I still love movies, and I still go and sit in the back of the big dark room with everybody else, and I want the same thrill.</p><p>I grew up watching those blaxploitation movies. Ron O&#39;Neal, Richard Roundtree, Jim Brown, Pam Grier. For the first time, I saw &#39;The Negro&#39; get one over on &#39;The Man.&#39;</p><p>I kind of realize that I have a tendency to choose the kind of films I watched when I was a kid and would go home and pretend with my friends that we were in those movies after we saw them.</p><p>All movies aren&#39;t fun some are hard work. You try to do something and convey a set of emotions that have to do with some real life kind of stuff.</p><p>People go to movies on Saturday to get away from the war in Iraq and taxes and election news and pedophiles online and just go and have some fun. I like doing movies that are fun.</p><p>For a number of years, I&#39;d been around the kind of people who financed movies and the kind of people who are there to make the deals for movies. But I&#39;d always had this naive idea that everybody wants to make movies as good as they can be, which is stupid.</p><p>A lot of the themes of my movies, the actual stories, come from tabloid stories.</p><p>It&#39;s a required part of your film history to know who Woody is. His movies are so wonderful, and not just funny but so insightful about human behavior.</p><p>I was going to make movies. I was the one in the family who was always rolling the video camera, making movies of my brothers around town, and then screening them for my parents. I still would love to make movies someday... that&#39;s something that really means a lot to me, and I know I&#39;ll have the chance to do it one day.</p><p>Bill Hanna and I owe an awful lot to television, but we both got our start and built the first phase of our partnership in the movies.</p><p>I&#39;d love to act more. I&#39;ve had to turn down multiple movies because I was on tour, but it&#39;s encouraging to know that someday there might be the right role, the right timing. And I&#39;ve been writing a lot of music, so hopefully very soon I&#39;ll have recorded a project of my own. I also want to get a boat and open a restaurant.</p><p>When we were doing &#39;Freaks and Geeks&#39;, I didn&#39;t quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn&#39;t on me. I thought I was helping the other actors by keeping them on their toes, but nobody appreciated it when I would trip them up. So I was improvising a little bit back then, but not in a productive way.</p><p>My agent said, &#39;You aren&#39;t good enough for movies.&#39; I said, &#39;You&#39;re fired.&#39;</p><p>I don&#39;t make movies because I think audiences will want to go see them.</p><p>Studios, because they are investing a great deal of money in movies, they want a guarantee that when they hire somebody that person can deliver for them. Everything is fear based, so they pigeonhole people. But I&#39;ve written everything, from Westerns to sci-fi to dramedy, I&#39;ve done it all.</p><p>I think that my vampires in general were influenced by my being allowed to watch the Hammer vampire films. Vampire Circus, also shown as Circus of Fear, was one of those movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve managed to do movies and still keep a lifestyle where I can go to ballgames, go to a grocery store like everybody else.</p><p>If your goal is to be the biggest movie star in the world, a 10-movie contract is gold. It was never my goal. Up until now, I made movies - and I have a nice house, a nice car. I&#39;m fortunate, happy and grateful. Life is good.</p><p>All my good movies, nobody sees.</p><p>I don&#39;t know any form of art or entertainment that can affect people the way movies can. I know it sounds ridiculous, but they can change your world. They can change your views.</p><p>What do I geek out about? What am I? Hmmm. I love movies. I watch movies. I like big, sweeping epics, like Ed Zwick stuff: &#39;The Last Samurai,&#39; &#39;Legends of the Fall,&#39; &#39;Blood Diamond,&#39; &#39;Glory.&#39;</p><p>It seems like the studios are either making giant blockbusters, or really super-small indies. And the mid-level films I grew up on, like &#39;Back to the Future&#39; and all those John Hughes movies, the studios aren&#39;t doing. It&#39;s hard to get them on their feet.</p><p>Movies are movies, television is television.</p><p>I&#39;ve had nine of my books adapted to film, and almost all were enjoyable. I&#39;ve been very lucky with Hollywood, and look forward to more movies being adapted. But I don&#39;t get involved in that process. I know nothing about making movies and I stay away from it and hope for the best.</p><p>My grandmother and I saw an average of eight movies a week, double features, second run.</p><p>I don&#39;t like to watch my own movies - I fall asleep in my own movies.</p><p>Movies are hard work. The public doesn&#39;t see that. The critics don&#39;t see it. But they&#39;re a lot of work. A lot of work.</p><p>I&#39;ll work with a director if I think I&#39;m going to get into a comfortable situation, and if it&#39;s someone I respect and who respects me, even if they&#39;re not so well known. Movies are hard to make, and you have to work toward a common ethic and do your best.</p><p>Skinniness is not your friend when you&#39;re over 40. I&#39;d like to gain a good 10 pounds, but I did always have a fat, round face that plagued me when I was young. When I started to make movies, I couldn&#39;t look at myself.</p><p>The way Hollywood portrays mothers - you&#39;re either all good and saint-like, or you&#39;re all bad. And I think the real honesty of motherhood is not given a voice in movies. I miss that as an audience member.</p><p>When they make a woman&#39;s picture, they treat it like a &#39;woman&#39;s picture.&#39; In the &#39;40s, they didn&#39;t treat Joan Crawford movies like that, but as the big movies of their year. I&#39;m upset that there&#39;s no &#39;Terminator&#39; with a woman in Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s role. Because that would make just as much money.</p><p>I&#39;m always working on stuff. But they never materialize. I&#39;m always working on movies and TV shows.</p><p>American movies and music deliver themes of freedom, innocence, and power that appeal to others - partly because America itself was put together out of a multiplicity of national traditions.</p><p>Violent behavior exists in one&#39;s psychological makeup much deeper than the level that receives information from television or movies.</p><p>When I go into making a movie, personally, I don&#39;t try to bring other pieces of movies with me.</p><p>I think there&#39;s an instinct to make grotesque horror films that are purely carnal, like the &#39;Saw&#39; movies.</p><p>I think more than writers, the major influences on me have been European movies, jazz, and Abstract Expressionism.</p><p>I watch movies occasionally, and I watch documentaries. Virtually nothing else.</p><p>I never stopped studying Buddhism. In the past few years, in between movies, I do a retreat.</p><p>I am so happy because I want more people to like martial arts movie not just martial arts audience. Even martial arts can be used in comedy, in drama, in horror movies, in different kinds of movies.</p><p>Coming Home had been made before and Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter, different kinds of movies.</p><p>Luis Bunuel made great movies.</p><p>I&#39;m terrible at horror movies, by the way. I get scared so easily.</p><p>Part of the reason why movie bosses are so obsessed with crime movies is because they know that world and the criminals. And that&#39;s what they are - they would not hesitate to act illegally to achieve profit and gain.</p><p>One of the joys of going to the movies was that it was trashy, and we should never lose that.</p><p>As a kid, I liked the &#39;Halloween&#39; movies and &#39;Nightmare On Elm Street&#39; and all that kind of stuff. But as an adult, I really don&#39;t watch much horror, to be honest.</p><p>I&#39;m a big kid, I&#39;m a kid at heart, so I still love the classic family films, such as the great Warner Bros film &#39;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&#39; - not the remake, but the original. It&#39;s still one of the best movies, hands down, ever made, and of course that goes back to the ingenuity of the characters and the storyline.</p><p>I wanted to escape Small Town U.S.A. To dismiss the boundaries, to explore. My life experience came from watching movies, TV, and reading books and magazines. When your culture comes from watching TV everyday, you&#39;re bombarded with images of things that seem cool, places that seem interesting, people who have jobs and careers and opportunities.</p><p>If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts.</p><p>I went to film school and wanted to learn everything there was about making movies.</p><p>I&#39;m a person who likes these sort of movies... sad but moving &#39;art movies&#39; that normally are at a festival and then they go to a small art house theater and disappear.</p><p>In theater or movies you see either &#39;I&#39;m religious&#39; or &#39;I&#39;m an atheist.&#39; I&#39;ve never seen too much discussion of &#39;I believe there&#39;s a higher power but I&#39;m hesitant to reach out to him because I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m worthy of his attention.&#39;</p><p>I&#39;ve never been interested in action movies. Definitely not interested in sci-fi.</p><p>And the VCR did the same thing: the movie industry thought nobody would ever watch movies any more.</p><p>I&#39;m a spoilt brat. I thought I was just going to walk in and make movies. But I&#39;d been my own boss for so long that all of a sudden to be facing a roomful of people who were niggling over every little scene... I just thought I&#39;d go back and draw my comics and have a happy life.</p><p>I grew up on the crime stuff. Spillane, Chandler, Jim Thompson, and noir movies like Fuller, Orson Welles, Fritz Lang. When I first showed up in New York to write comics back in the late 1970s, I came with a bunch of crime stories but everybody just wanted men in tights.</p><p>In some movies you feel like you&#39;re a very small part of a huge machine. Whereas in the theater you can have a very small part, but you can still feel the weight and the gravity of it. Given the nature of theater, it&#39;s a more concentrated and quiet experience.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if I see myself as really an action hero, but I like doing physical movies and I like doing movies where the writing is very lean.</p><p>I love European movies and I kind of grew up on European films.</p><p>If I have to produce movies, direct movies, whatever to change the way Hollywood treats older women, I&#39;ll do it. If I have to bend the rules, I will. If I have to break them, I will.</p><p>I&#39;ve always had this idea that I wanted movies to make people better not worse.</p><p>I love making movies, but there&#39;s nothing like being in front of an audience.</p><p>So, yes, there&#39;s nothing I love more than listening to directors talk about their movies.</p><p>With actors like Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and Harrison Ford, what made them such icons is that even in dramatic movies, their characters had a sense of humor.</p><p>The movies I made when I was 14 or 15, I have a hard time looking at those. Those were the awkward years. I don&#39;t know if anybody can look at something they did when they were 14 and not wince.</p><p>Movies will end up being this esoteric art form, where only singular people will put films out in a small group of theaters.</p><p>I made about 28 movies, and I think about five of them were good.</p><p>I grew up watching Steven Spielberg and scary movies.</p><p>Even in the former Soviet Union, they have good copies of my movies.</p><p>My normal cycle for movies is eighteen months and each part is separate.</p><p>Maybe when I stop making movies, I&#39;ll understand my work better.</p><p>When I was a kid, I had two great guilty pleasures. One was horror movies and the other was martial arts movies.</p><p>The thing that&#39;s protected me creatively is that the movies have made profits.</p><p>I do other sorts of things. I act in other people&#39;s movies. I direct operas. I write books.</p><p>American movies are often very good at mining those great underlying myths that make films robustly travel across class, age, gender, culture.</p><p>The first two movies I directed failed, when I was 21 and 23, and that was the greatest thing that could have happened.</p><p>All studio movies are the middle of the Bell curve. The only way to do something is to do it yourself. And the only way to do that is to not take any money from anyone or take as little money as possible from anyone and that&#39;s it.</p><p>I manage to hide in my movies.</p><p>Hollywood and the recording industry argue that current law permits the copying of songs and movies, and sharing them on the Internet. This enables young people to grow up learning how to steal.</p><p>Well, the thing about great fictional characters from literature, and the reason that they&#39;re constantly turned into characters in movies, is that they completely speak to what makes people human.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know this about myself, but when &#39;Pirates of the Caribbean&#39; came out I realised that I didn&#39;t enjoy a huge amount of recognition. I didn&#39;t react to it well, but I think life is about finding out who you are and what you like. So I started doing independent movies and art-house films instead.</p><p>I use to watch like maybe three or four movies, five days out of the week. I was a movie buff, but I really didn&#39;t know what it was like behind the scenes, or the whole political process of it.</p><p>Man, I love the &#39;Lord of the Rings&#39; movies. Some people would say I&#39;m weird for liking those types of movies, but they are so cool.</p><p>I want to work with great directors. I want to work on good material with good actors. I&#39;ve probably done 20 movies at this point and a lot of independents. It&#39;s been an incredible ride and I love it and I&#39;m just going to keep going and doing what I&#39;m doing.</p><p>I love scary movies. The Shining and Don&#39;t Look Now are two of the best.</p><p>Everybody gets typecast in movies, but you have to make wise choices. I&#39;d say around 90 percent of movie casting is about the way you look, so you have to fight that. If producers had their way, I&#39;d only be in action films, but I&#39;m interested in a more varied career than that.</p><p>I like to go from mainstream movies to more artsy films. I don&#39;t sign on for the money. Maybe I should, but I don&#39;t. There&#39;s always a good reason for doing something.</p><p>I love the first two X-Men movies because I thought that Bryan Singer did such a great job. He elevated that whole genre. He&#39;s a very talented director.</p><p>I love music, and after my first experience with movies, I can&#39;t wait to do more.</p><p>When I started doing movies, every crew member was older than me.</p><p>When you kill somebody in the movies, it matters, whereas in literature it can be allegorical.</p><p>In social institutions, the whole is always less than the sum of its parts. There will never be a state as good as its people, or a church worthy of its congregation, or a university equal to its faculty and students.</p><p>There is no such thing as a self-made man. We are made up of thousands of others. Everyone who has ever done a kind deed for us, or spoken one word of encouragement to us, has entered into the makeup of our character and our thoughts, as well as our success.</p><p>I had always loved beautiful and artistic things, though before leav</p><p>Exploration is really the essence of the human spirit.</p><p>The only business of the head in the world is to bow a ceaseless obeisance to the heart.</p><p>Though one sits in meditation in a particular place, the Self in him can exercise its influence far away. Though still, it moves everywhere...The Self cannot be known by anyone who desists not from unrighteous ways, controls not his senses, stills not his mind, and practices not meditation.</p><p>That which exists through itself is called The Eternal. The Eternal has neither name nor shape. It is the one essence, the one primal spirit. Essence and life cannot be seen. They are contained in the light of heaven. The light of heaven cannot be seen. It is contained in the two eyes.</p><p>If the thoughts are absolutely tranquil the heavenly heart can be seen. The heavenly heart lies between sun and moon (i.e. between the two eyes). It is the home of the inner light. To make light circulate is the deepest and most wonderful secret. The light is easy to move, but difficult to fix. If it is made to circulate long enought, then it crystallizes itself; that is the natural spirit body...</p><p>True thoughts have duration in themselves. If the thoughts endure, the seed is enduring; if the seed endures, the energy endures; if the energy endures, then will the spirit endure. The spirit is thought; thought is the heart; the heart is the fire; the fire is the Elixir.</p><p>Two stones build two houses, three stones build six houses, four build twenty-four houses, five build one hundred and twenty houses, six build seven hundred and twenty houses and seven build five thousand and forty houses. From thence further go and reckon what the mouth cannot express and the ear cannot hear.</p><p>Tomorrow is a satire on today, And shows its weakness.</p><p>A soul without reflection, like a pile Without inhabitant, to ruin runs.</p><p>By all means use some time to be alone.</p><p>Too low they build who build below the skies.</p><p>It takes vision and courage to create-it takes faith and courage to prove.</p><p>Selfishness is the only real atheism; aspiration, unselfishness, the only real religion.</p><p>One of my favorite philosophical tenets is that people will agree with you only if they already agree with you. You do not change people&#39;s minds.</p><p>Choose silence of all virtues, for by it you hear other men&#39;s imperfections, and conceal your own.</p><p>In Fame&#39;s temple there is always a niche to be found for rich dunces, importunate scoundrels or successful butchers of the human race.</p><p>Before God manifested Himself, when all things were still hidden in Him... He began by forming an imperceptible point; that was His own thought. With this thought He then began to construct a mysterious and holy form... the Universe.</p><p>Every soul is subject to the trial of Transmigration...An individual does not know that he is called for assessment before entering this World as well as after leaving it. He does not know how many transformations and esoteric trials he has to pass through...and that souls revolve like a stone shot from a sling.</p><p>All souls must undergo transmigration and the souls of men revolve like a stone which is thrown from a sling, so many turns before the final release...Only those who have not completed their perfection must suffer the wheel of rebirth by being reborn into another human body.</p><p>To understand a holy unity, examine the flame rising from a candle. We see at first two kinds of light, one glistening white and one blue or black. The white light is above and rises in a straight line, the blue or black light is beneath and appears to be the source of the white; yet the two lights are so closely united they form one single flame. But the source formed by the blue or black light is, in turn, attached to the wick under it. The white light never changes, it always remains white; but several shades are distinguishable in the lower light. Moreover, the lower light moves in two opposite directions; above, it is connected to the white light, and below, it is attached to the burning matter; this matter continually consumes itself and rises toward the upper light. It is thus that all that is, reunites with the one unity.</p><p>The entire lower world was created in the likeness of the higher world. All that exists in the higher world appears like an image in this lower world; yet all this is but One.</p><p>Temptation is the fire that brings up the scum of the heart.</p><p>Be good, be kind, be humane, and charitable; love your fellows; console the afflicted; pardon those who have done you wrong.</p><p>When you doubt, abstain.</p><p>Technological change defines the horizon of our material world as it shapes the limiting conditions of what is possible and what is barely imaginable. It erodes ... assumptions about the nature of our reality, the ?pattern? in which we dwell, and lays open new choices.</p><p>Hearing, seeing and understanding each other, humanity from one end of the earth to the other now lives simultaneously, omnipresent like a god thanks to its own creative ability. And, thanks to its victory over space and time, it would now be splendidly united for all time, if it were not confused again and again by that fatal delusion which causes humankind to keep on destroying this grandiose unity and to destroy itself with the same resources which gave it power over the elements.</p><p>Many children, many cares; no children, no felicity.</p><p>A sound discretion is not so much indicated by never making a mistake as by never repeating it.</p><p>Enthusiasm is the inspiration of everything great. Without it no man is to be feared, and with it none despised.</p><p>Fame - a few words upon a tombstone, and the truth of those not to be depended on.</p><p>Good men have the fewest fears. He has but one great fear who fears to do wrong; he has a thousand who has overcome it.</p><p>Mind unemployed is mind unenjoyed.</p><p>Kindness is a language the dumb canspeak and the deaf can hear and understand.</p><p>It is ever the invisible that is the object of our profoundest worship.

It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be glandular.
