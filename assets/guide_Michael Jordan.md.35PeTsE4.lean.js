I don&#39;t think my job is more important than all the firemen and policemen&#39;s jobs each and every day. There is a place for relaxation, and I think that&#39;s where my responsibility lies. Hopefully, I can provide relaxation for some people.</p><p>---024---</p><p>If that was my concern, I wouldn&#39;t do this. I&#39;m not afraid to take on a challenge.

Even if I feel that I am no longer good or skilled, I can no longer really see basketball. But my love for basketball is still unrepentant!</p><p>---037---</p><p>I have failed once and for all, and this is the reason for my success.</p><p>---038---</p><p>There is only one person who can define success in your life -- and that&#39;s you.</p><p>---039---</p><p>I never think about what the consequences of losing a big competition will be, because when you worry about the consequences, you tend to think about the pessimistic and negative side!</p><p>---040---</p><p>The dignity of the moon is not given to the moon people, but is won by oneself.</p><p>---041---</p><p>In our eyes, some people can win games, but it is through teamwork that people can win championships.</p><p>---042---</p><p>Step by step, you will gain benefits by yourself, this is the only way to succeed.</p><p>---043---</p><p>It&#39;s not shameful to lose, but it&#39;s shameful for the person who comes to you to be ugly.</p><p>---044---</p><p>In my life, I have failed again and again, and this is the source of my success.</p><p>---045---</p><p>It&#39;s not about how hard you push yourself in the process. It&#39;s about having a positive attitude and having something to look forward to.</p><p>---046---</p><p>If I care about this, I won&#39;t make a comeback... I&#39;m not afraid of provocation... I&#39;m not afraid of taking a new step. If I lose, I&#39;ll just get up and start fighting again.</p><p>---047---</p><p>I&#39;m not afraid of a challenge... I&#39;m not afraid of taking a new step. If I lose, I can only use the opportunity to get up and start fighting again.</p><p>---048---</p><p>I don&#39;t have a feeling of defeat that won&#39;t get me far. I came back with confidence that I could still make a difference. If I had just sat here and listened to people telling me I couldn&#39;t come back, I wouldn&#39;t have been here.</p><p>---049---</p><p>I listen to people&#39;s praises of me, I enjoy the joy that cannot be brought by my success, I know what I am pursuing, but I never stop and never take the step forward.</p><p>---050---</p><p>When you have experienced all the defeats, the next moment is the moment when you suddenly hit the opponent in front of your eyes.</p><p>---051---</p><p>I am not afraid of the dark wind, I know that I have more people&#39;s eyes on me, I know that people have high hopes for my family, I know that everyone wants to see me defeated. When I left, everyone wanted to compete with me, and now it has changed.</p><p>---052---</p><p>It also shows that when I left the game, I left behind some kind of legacy. You may not understand that when we won the last championship, we could have retired and we could have overthrown the foundation we had built at that time. If Fiedy had stayed with the Bulls, we would be here now.</p><p>---053---</p><p>I have failed time and again in my life, but keeping moving forward is the source of my success.</p><p>---054---</p><p>When I was about to step onto the basketball court, I imagined myself to be the best basketball player I could be. I had this overwhelming confidence: once I stepped onto the court, I could make all the good moves and emotions I could achieve.</p><p>---055---</p><p>You beat me, you can tell your generation that I beat Jordan. But I beat you, my generation should look at the other person and see who is the winner? (When Jordan was challenged by a rookie)</p><p>---056---</p><p>If you accept the treatment that people give you, especially negative predictions, then you should never use that to change the outcome.</p><p>---057---</p><p>I don&#39;t care about money, I don&#39;t care, even if I only get a little money, I just want to find the profit in the long run, I pay more attention to basketball, because I love basketball!</p><p>---058---</p><p>When I retired, I could control the track. I was the fastest target that everyone wanted to go up. Now, everyone has expectations of me. I appeared in a low-key manner. The contrast is too big, which is refreshing. Everyone expects us to win 50 games, but many people say we can&#39;t win 30 games. This is a challenge... I don&#39;t have the confidence to come back with 50 wins. If we win 50 and lose 32, I won&#39;t surprise you. I think we will definitely win 19 and lose 63.</p><p>---059---</p><p>We players are also actors. I can&#39;t use their work to make firefighters or police officers more important to us. This is just to make people feel relaxed. I have a responsibility to speak up, or maybe I can do something small to make people feel relaxed!</p><p>---060---</p><p>This is a question I&#39;ve always thought about, and my agent might be thinking about it now.</p><p>---061---</p><p>Everyone is so upset about my feelings towards the club. If I read all the newspapers that are against my comeback, I swear I can&#39;t survive in America. America is all about freedom and freedom. That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing now. I&#39;m not committing any crime here. I just want to play basketball with my eyes. If I get tired of playing with my eyes, I&#39;ll go to the elite. Win or lose, it&#39;s all good. Anyway, you can&#39;t take away my six championships and rings.</p><p>---062---</p><p>I don&#39;t want to get too close to those guys who are chasing me around on the road. If I do, I think that&#39;s a great challenge that can stand out from the crowd.</p><p>---063---</p><p>I think I have enough patience, I don&#39;t dare to expect to score 40 or 50 points in the first lane. I think I can gradually adapt to the fierce competition in my own way.</p><p>---064---</p><p>Many people are worried that my return will stop the growth of the NBA. I came out to help (the NBA grow). I have never seen people put my logo on the road, and I have never seen people use TV to broadcast my games. I only watch basketball for the love of this sport.</p><p>---065---</p><p>I have failed one after another in my life, and that is why I have been successful. I have never been afraid of failure, I can accept failure, and I will never try even if I cannot accept it. &quot;</p><p>---066---</p><p>I&#39;m not saying I can beat Science. Brian is really young, I can beat McGregor. If you all say that you guys want to replace me, I believe you guys must be eager to see me, and I am also eager to see you.</p><p>---067---</p><p>I love this game that we are going to see now!</p><p>---068---</p><p>If we think we are the best player in a certain game, it is really a small matter to show people that we have the advantage, and it also means that we should work harder and give more to others. Our success should not come from enjoying comfortably.</p>",154)]))}const m=t(p,[["render",s]]);export{d as __pageData,m as default};
