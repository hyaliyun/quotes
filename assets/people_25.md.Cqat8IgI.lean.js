professor of biophysics in 1977 he retired from the university of aarhus in 1988 but he has kept his offices at the institutein 1997 he received the nobel prize in chemistry together with paul d boyer and john e walker for his discovery of nakatpase 1skou had taken a few years away from his clinical training in the early 1950s to study the action of local anaesthetics he had discovered that a substances anaesthetic action was related to its ability to dissolve in a layer of the lipid part of the plasma membrane the anaesthetic molecules affected the opening of sodium channels which he assumed to be protein this he argued would affect the movement of sodium ions and make nerve cells inexcitable thus causing anaesthesiaskou thought that other types of membrane protein might also be affected by local anaesthetics dissolving in the lipid part of the membrane he therefore had the idea of looking at an enzyme which was embedded in the membrane and finding out if its properties were affected by local anaesthetics he looked at atpase in crab nervesthe enzyme was there but unfortunately its activity was very variable and he needed a highly active enzyme for his studies eventually he managed to discover that atpase was most active when exposed to the right combination of sodium potassium and magnesium ions only then did he realise that this enzyme might have something to do with the active movement of sodium and potassium across the plasma membrane this idea had been postulated many years before however the mechanism was quite unknownskou published his findings however in his paper he was wary of identifying the enzyme with the active ion movement so he left out the term sodiumpotassium pump from the title of his paper indeed he seems only gradually to have realised the importance of his discovery and he continued his studies on local anaestheticsin 1958 skou went to a conference in vienna to describe his work on cholinesterase there he met robert post born 1920 2 who had been studying the pumping of sodium and potassium in red blood cells post had recently discovered that three sodium ions were pumped out of the cell for every two potassium ions pumped in and in his research he had made use of a substance called ouabain which had recently been shown to inhibit the pumppost had not read skous paper but he was excited when skou told him about his work with atpase post asked whether the enzyme was inhibited by ouabain at this stage skou was unaware that ouabain inhibited the pump but he immediately telephoned to his lab and arranged for the experiment to be done ouabain did indeed inhibit the enzyme thus establishing a link between the enzyme and the sodiumpotassium pump"},{"author":"Henry Grahn Hermunen","quote":"henry grahn hermunen
