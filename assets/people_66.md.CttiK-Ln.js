mathematician known for his work in geometry particularly symplectic geometry and lie theorysternberg earned his phd in 1955 from johns hopkins university where he wrote a dissertation under aurel wintner this became the basis for his first wellknown published result known as the sternberg lineralization theorem which asserts that a smooth map near a hyperbolic fixed point can be made linear by a smooth change of coordinates provided that certain nonresonance conditions are satisfied also proved were generalizations of the birkhoff canonical form theorems for volume preserving mappings in ndimensions and symplectic mappings all in the smooth case an account of these results and of their implications for the theory of dynamical systems can be found in bruhats exposition travaux de sternberg seminaire bourbaki volume 8 1961after postdoctoral work at new york university 19561957 and an instructorship at university of chicago 19571959 sternberg joined the mathematics department at harvard university in 1959 where he is currently george putnam professor of pure and applied mathematicsin the 1960s sternberg became involved with isadore singer in the project of revisiting lie cartans papers from the early 1900s on the classification of the simple transitive infinite lie pseudogroups and of relating cartans results to recent results in the theory of gstructures and supplying rigorous by presentday standards proofs of his main theorems also in a sequel to this paper written jointly with victor guillemin and daniel quillen he extended this classification to a larger class of pseudogroups the primitive infinite pseudogroups one important byproduct of the gqs paper was the integrability of characteristics theorem for overdetermined systems of partial differential equations this figures in gqs as an analytical detail in their classification proof but is nowadays the most cited result of the papermany of sternbergs other papers have been concerned with lie group actions on symplectic manifolds among his contributions to this subject are his paper with bertram kostant on brs cohomology his paper with david kazhdan and bertram kostant on dynamical systems of calogero type and his paper with victor guillemin on the qr equals zero conjecture all three of these papers involve various aspects of the theory of symplectic reduction in the first of these papers bertram kostant and sternberg show how reduction techniques enable one to give a rigorous mathematical treatment of what is known in the physics literature as the brs quantization procedure in the second the authors show how one can simplify the analysis of complicated dynamical systems like the calogero system by describing these systems as symplectic reductions of much simpler systems and the paper with victor guillemin contain the first rigorous formulation and proof of a hitherto vague assertion about group actions on symplectic manifolds the assertion that quantization commutes with reductionthe last of these papers was also the inspiration for a result in equivariant symplectic geometry that disclosed for the first time a surprising and unexpected connection between the theory of hamiltonian torus actions on compact symplectic manifolds and the theory of convex polytopes this theorem the ags convexity theorem was simultaneously discovered by guilleminsternberg and michael atiyah in the early nineteen eightiessternbergs contributions to symplectic geometry and lie theory have also included a number of basic text books on these subjects among them the three graduate level texts with victor guillemin geometric asymptotics symplectic techniques in physics and semiclassical analysis his lectures on differential geometry is a popular standard text book for upper level undergraduate courses on differential manifolds the calculus of variations lie theory and the geometry of gstructures he also published the more recent curvature in mathematics and physicssternberg has in addition played a role in recent developments in theoretical physics he has written several papers with yuval neeman on the role of supersymmetry in elementary particle physics in which they explore from this perspective the higgs mechanism the method of spontaneous symmetry breaking and a unified approach to the theory of quarks and leptonsamong the honors he has been accorded as recognition for these achievements are a guggenheim fellowship in 1974 election to the american academy of arts and sciences in 1984 election to the national academy of sciences in 1986 and election to the american philosophical society in 2010 he has also been made an honorary member of the academy of arts and sciences of the royal academy of spain and awarded an

fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in terms of fundamental buoyancy and resilience when first published bridburys views were extremely controversial standing in contradiction to longprevailing orthodoxy at the time most economic historians were inclined to see the late medieval period as one of prolonged economic malaise an age of recession arrested economic development and declining national incomeone of the strongest points in bridburys argument was a comparison of revenues from the lay subsidy of 1334 with those of tudor taxation in 15245 dr bridburys figures indicated that most towns paid significantly more in tax during henry viiis reign than they had in the early years of edward iii in addition bridbury argues that taxation figures indicate that the towns doubled their share of the national wealth over the intervening centuries these figures are difficult to reconcile with the idea that commerce was in decay during the postblack death perioddr bridbury has argued against simplistic malthusian models of history in time many aspects of his interpretations of the postblack death period have achieved widespread acceptance in particular his characterisation of the years between the plague and the late 1370s as a period of agricultural growth now commands wide agreement however many historians remain sceptical of bridburys optimism regarding the fifteenth century as a whole increasingly specialists are moving away from the idea that the state of the late medieval economy can be characterised in terms of a single national trend either upwards or

sympathy for instance can only approach empathy unless it overshoots its goal and sinks in a welter of selfpity in my experience it is very hard to lose oneself entirely or give all of oneself to a cause or to another human being or to the act of painting although most of these eighteen works on canvas deal with the situation of a single human presence distorted by mood or circumstance they are essentially about how hard and how necessary it is to try to touchrecently utter has contributed to the upcoming book about friend and colleague stephen kasner stephen kasner works 1993

raymond dennis cobbing born june 1944 london is an english historian and professor of history at rhodes university grahamstown south africa known best for his controversial and groundbreaking research into zulu culture of the early 19th centurycobbing gained a ba from the university of london and a phd from lancaster university he is regarded as the first historian to attempt to discredit conventional historical beliefs about the mfecane a period of wars during the 1820s and 1830s that resulted in the emergence of the zulu nation in a paper published in the journal of african history in 1988 cobbing argued that the mfecane had been the construct of apartheid politicians and historians attempting to justify the longstanding oppression of black south africans by the white minority instead of an internally induced process of blackonblack destruction cobbing argued that much of the violence had been brought about by european slave traders and settlers who had contracted local tribal leaders to capture slaves for sale at delagoa bay now maputo the rise of the zulu state under cobbings hypothesis was thus more of a defensive reaction to the slavetrading activities of other tribes in the region rather than a process of active internal aggression as argued by some contemporary scholarscobbings hypothesis was highly controversial when first published several books and articles have been written focused on rebutting cobbings arguments a prominent example being roger b becks slavery in south africa captive labor on the dutch frontier which featured a collection of articles challenging cobbings contentions often now referred to as the cobbing controversy historians are still very much divided on the issue of the emergence of the zulu nation and the accuracy of conventional accounts of the mfecane most agree however that cobbings analysis offered several key breakthroughs and offered a robust alternative to accounts of the mfecane that had been taught in school history curricula during apartheidcobbing spent two months as a visiting fellow at the university of oxford in 2002 he currently lives in grahamstown south africa and recently retired from lecturing in history at rhodes university where his course the origins of the modern world crisis was very popular cobbings current work focuses on a variety of subjects including the history of homo
