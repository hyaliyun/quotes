in the 1960s having been introduced to him by antony armstrongjones 1st earl of snowdonexamples of donalds work are held in the collections of museum of scotland edinburgh victoria albert museum london and the collection of the worshipful company of goldsmithsan elegant revolutionaryin his halfcentury as a working jeweller john donald has been feted as an idealist a pioneering designer and as a craftsman part of a select group who revolutionised jewellery design in the early 1960s he went on to establish a successful business and an international reputation his work captures the late twentieth century ideals of glamour and modernityborn in 1928 to a golfing father and a socially ambitious mother john donald attended art college as a compromise between sport and university he studied graphic design at farnham and in 1952 he was offered the chance to enrol in the metalwork department of the royal college of art this change of direction was essentially a pragmatic one as the young man was keen to experience london but he soon discovered an affinity for working with metal that would shape the rest of his lifeat college john donald joined a group of hardworking and hardplaying exservicemen often staying in the studio late into the night he shared digs in chelsea with fellow metalwork students robert welch and gerald benney all three friends would later become famous for their silver and jewellery designshe graduated in 1955 and left a year later with a firstclass degree however it was several years before he could establish himself as a jeweller and in the meantime he was forced to support himself through a combination of male modelling and industrial design in 1960 the proceeds from designing luggage and national health spectacles at last allowed him to buy his own studio a year later he entered five pieces in the seminal international exhibition of modern jewellery 18901961 held at goldsmiths hall and by 1964 he could number princess margaret and the queen mother among his patronsjohn donalds designs perfectly caught the mood of freedom and excitement which swept britain during the 1960s using simple materials such as gold rod and uncut crystal he created expressive abstract pieces free from the conventions of shape and style which had constrained earlier jewels he was one of a small group of craftsmen whose radical entries to the international exhibition ushered in a new era of modern jewellery characterised by adventurous forms and textures the movement deliberately avoided showcasing precious materials or artificially imposing a subject it was as the sponsors of the exhibition proclaimed as uninhibited as modern sculpture or fashion individual imaginative and smartgeometric obsessions john donalds experimental techniquesjohn donalds jewellery is characterised by the dynamic energy created by its unusual forms and textures he started experimenting with gold and precious stones during the late 1950s and his difficult circumstances during that time forced him to take creative new directions in 1957 he bought a quantity of gold rods and chenier a smallbore tubing supplied directly by bullion merchants it was some of the only gold the struggling jeweller could afford but by cutting it into angled lengths or fusing tiny crosssections he was able to create dramatic geometric patterns the natural form of crystals was another source of inspiration less expensive and more diverse than conventional jewels their planes and striations were echoed in his textured surfaces one of his most distinctive motifs the cube directly developed from his use of squareshaped iron pyritesthe experimentation continued when he moved into his own studio in 1960 and it was here that he created another important motif the bead and cup pouring molten gold into cold water he discovered that it divided into small beads some of which caught bubbles of air and cooled into hollow cups the beads were painstakingly soldered together creating a complex surface of contrasting of convex and concave shapes he later cast bead and cup sections enabling him to use them in larger scale designsbeautiful intricate and thoroughly modern the jewels created with these techniques make a big impact using only simple componentscrowns shadows and the concern for textureone of john donalds signature techniques is the striking drum or crown mount framed by a protective basket of textured gold gems are set at the end of tiny rods to form glittering openwork constellations he has modestly said that the method was developed as a way round his lack of conventional skills however fixing the narrow rods into their tiny screwholes requires a high level of technical expertise the mounts are wholly unique and allow a delicacy of setting almost impossible with more traditional designsthe drums themselves reveal other john donald trademarks textured nugget flakes and wavy rods continuing his experiments with immersing molten metal in water the young jeweller discovered he could use this process to produce small flakes whose nuggetlike surface gave the gold an almost organic appearance these could be used in a variety of forms but they were especially effective when combined with the sinuous shapes of melted gold rod melting was also used to give other gold elements a fluid feel especially in the nuggetedged apertures which appear in some of his most spectacular jewelleryall these methods highlight john donalds deep preoccupation with the effects of texture of light like many of his contemporaries he rejected the monotony of traditional polished surfaces instead his work contrasts the glow of uneven metal with highly polished sheens and dazzling gemstones the shadows cast by his three dimensional forms adding an extra element of dramaa very fashionable craftsmanfrom the early 1960s john donalds reputation grew rapidly his work found favour with women of fashion as well as critics and he was able to produce jewellery whose avantgarde design was matched only by the beauty of their precious materials he married in 1962 and soon had two young children living above his bayswater workshopby the middle of the decade both john donalds business and his family were starting to outgrow his modest bayswater workshop and premises above it and he began searching for a new studio the site he eventually chose was 120 cheapside a small shop at the front of the new schroders bank building this was a significant choice by moving to a shop in the city he was opting not only to independently retail his work but to do so away from the traditional hub of the west end however he went ahead and in 1968 opened a small but elegant gallery and workshop delighting his landlords by bringing a working jeweller back to the elizabethan goldsmiths rowthe years that followed saw his business grow exponentially he opened one retail shop in bond street in 1971 and another in richmond in 1973 the former enterprise was a partnership with tecla pearls although lasting not much more than a year it allowed him to develop his imaginative and sensitive use of the gems the outlets enabled john donald to bring his innovative designs to a wide audience of more ordinary clients as well as his grand patrons from the banking and aristocratic worldseastern colour and oldfashioned influencesjohn donald travelled overseas right from the start of his career building up his international profile by exhibiting and selling new work in europe america and japan however his most important links were with the middle east and it was this region which inspired many of his designs in the closing decades of the centuryhe made his first visit there in 1969 holding a small exhibition at the sheraton hotel in kuwait it was an immediate success and he returned in 1971 when his threeweek stay earned enough money to see him through the crippling economic downturn which marked the beginning of that year the intense sunlight of the middle east drove him to be much bolder with his use of colours the islamic tiles and decorations he encountered on these trips were another source of new ideasanother great if unlikely influence on john donalds work originates much closer to home the quintessentially modern designer has studied victorian jewellery admiring its intricate thoughtful and honestly decorative style as a young student at the royal college of art he spent time looking at the victoria and albert museums extensive collection of 19th century jewels their elegant natural shapes and attention to detail find echoes in many of his pieces especially those which employ ingenious movable or interchangeable partsjohn donald and broochesbrooches were the first pieces of jewellery made by john donald using his innovative new techniques and they launched his career as an artistjeweller several examples representing his work at the 1961 international exhibition of modern jewellery the straight forward way in which brooches are worn gives maximum scope for experimentation and as a result he has always had a special fondness for this versatile ornamentsuch creative freedom means that some of his most important ideas can be traced through brooch design growth forms including minute organisms and minerals have been a theme informing his work from the very beginning the young john donald was one of the first jewellers to use uncut crystals studying specimens in the natural history museum the dramatic baroque expression of many examples reveals a wholly different influence a travelling scholarship he took to italy in 1955 here he absorbed the energy and drama of the countrys treasuresbut no matter how diverse his brooches like all his work are united by two overarching concerns the first is for the balance and integrity of his designsaccording to john donald all stones however valuable however beautiful must be subordinate to design the second is for their relationship with the wearer he has always maintained that i am very aware that my pieces are to be worn and when working on commissioned objects always take into account not only the appearance but the personality of the wearerout of the city and into the futurefor 37 years the cheapside shop occupied a unique place in the city of london the modern financial centre has its roots in the many goldsmiths workshops which populated the area in past centuries and as the only working goldsmith within the citys boundaries john donald provided an important link with these historic originsthis significant position was cemented by his very traditional role in creating pieces for the citys livery companies john donald has designed official regalia since the outset of his career producing his very first badge in 1956 whilst still a student at the royal college of art his first significant commission as an independent jeweller was to make three wardens badges for the goldsmiths company he was awarded the project in 1960 after winning a limited competition whose brief was to combine contemporary design with the companys ancient heraldic motifssince then he has made over 120 official badges all of which echo the skillful integration of old and new seen on this early example years of experience have also made him aware of not only the aesthetic but also the practical requirements of such pieces many are taken for repair after spending an eventful night tucked in the back pocket of a returning official so his designs are robust as well as attractivethe city lost its last goldsmith in 2005 when redevelopment led to the closure of the 120 cheapside shop however john donalds contribution to the world of precious metals is certainly far from over he is still driven with a passion for making beautiful objects and has planned a very active semiretirement working on specially commissioned pieces it is this desire for the handson experience of creation which has made his work so distinctive a consummate craftsman he has always been dedicated to producing things by hand believing in the importance of experimenting as a piece is madejohn donald claims that there have been no eureka moments in his career that his designs have instead evolved slowly over time this gradual distillation of ideas has enabled him to continue to innovate so that even now when his early work is being sold as prestigious antiques his jewellery displays an undeniable feeling of modernity"},{"author":"Jeffrey St. Clair","quote":"jeffrey st clair born 1959 in indianapolis indiana is an investigative journalist writer and editor he

resumed her travels recently spending time in africa the antarctic south america and asia she was in sri lanka when the tsunami hit in 2004 the sense of violence catastrophe and mortality is often reflected in her workfitzgeralds recent work has been characterised as an attempt to convey vulnerability through images which are impermanent transient and almost invisible she often utilises smoke grease and water condensation encased in plexiglass throughout the 1980s and early 1990s her work was largely spare and austere and she appeared to prefer a limited palette she often worked with a variety of media including glass metal fabric and paper and has designed a number of tapestries and carpets as well as costume designs for opera an understated approach is a continuing theme in her work the years she spent in japan clearly influenced her work and it sometimes featured quasicalligraphic marks characteristic of asian art she also works with materials that have a certain fragility and has been quoted as saying that as all experience is qualified by the inevitability of the end most art and hers in particular has a fundamental concern with death in conversation with felicity

insinuating the viewer into the realm of its layered and sitespecific arrangement halflife is a dramatic shift in the artists practice and by any standard one of the most ambitious in its aims and realisation this seems wholly appropriate however for an artist of fitzgeralds ability and radicalism one can recognise themes and subtleties here that are wholly consistent with the younger fitzgerald for example even of her earlier works in oil on canvas fitzgerald was acutely aware of how the viewer and the object viewed cohabited the work has a physical relationship with the audience who share the same space it begins the process of communication the absence here of oil organisms metal pins etc on painted canvas or panel will surprise many halflife is nothing if not a new stage on this artists journey and an intriguing invitation to follow suitmortality is a central theme that continues in this exhibition to confront the artist and the viewer in fact through a series of narrative progressions the visitor is innocently plunged into a purgatorial route through the gallerys dimly lit spaces while watching and unwittingly being watched many emotions and themes are explored a sense of disorientation and confusion follows you as you plot through the work through the various media and the many different surface treatments and aspects there is no consistent or even visible horizon time and space are poorly defined in the dim light just as you are looking peering there is the slowly dawning realisation of being caught on camera in a crucial hallofmirrors moment

reward from a dopamineindependent system to a dopaminedependent system this switch is mediated through a specific change in gabaa receptors in the vta from inhibitory to excitatory signaling in

pediatrician and gastroenterologist who was formerly the director of the pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition laboratory at the university of maryland school of medicine he is best known for proposing a link between secretin gastrointestinal disorders and autism and for as a result proposing that secretin might be an effective treatment for autism he originally became interested in this possible link after being contacted by victoria beck who brought in her autistic son parker to see horvath in april 1996 after she did so horvath injected parker with an intravenous dose of secretin as part of his diagnostic tests and according to his mother parkers autistic symptoms improved rapidly shortly thereafter mrs beck contacted one of horvaths colleagues alessio fasano to tell him the good news he replied mrs beck im very happy for you but nothing we would have done here could be responsible nevertheless mrs beck then became convinced that secretin was an effective autism treatment and therefore contacted bernard rimland to tell him about her experience rimland asked a number of other parents if they could help mrs beck after which kenneth sokolski of the university of california irvine responded that yes he thought he could sokolski had become intrigued by watching videotapes of parker seemingly showing his behavior improving greatly after receiving secretin and persuaded a california gastroenterologist to administer some to his own son aaron who had autism dr sokolski came to a similar conclusion with regard to his son as mrs beck had with regard to hers namely that while prior to aaron receiving secretin you couldnt get aaron to look at you at all that after just one dose aaron looked right in the therapists eyesin 1998 horvath published a paper describing parker aaron and one other child who also had autism in the journal of the association for academic minority physicians the paper stated that these three children had undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with intravenous secretin administration and that subsequently the childrens gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms had both improved significantly as a result of this research the university of maryland where horvath was working at the time filed a patent application for the use of secretin to treat autism but ended up giving the rights to the patent to beck since she was the first to suspect that secretin might be an effective autism treatment in 1999 horvath published another study of 36 children which concluded that unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption may contribute to the behavioral problems of the nonverbal autistic patients in an accompanying editorial pasquale accardo and howard bostwick of new york medical college wrote that horvaths study demonstrates consistent physiologic abnormalities increased density of paneths cells along with diminished pancreatic secretin secretion in autism that are not known to occur in any other specific gastrointestinal disorder that same year researchers from the university of north carolina led by adrian sandler published a randomized trial in which they reported that secretin was no more effective as an autism treatment than a placebo horvath replied in a letter to the editor that it is unusual for a single dose of a drug to result in full recovery from a chronic disease and also criticized the study for not including children with gastrointestinal symptoms horvath also argued that tests used to measure behavioral improvements may be unreliable when used in these trials because these tests were designed to diagnose autism not to assess druginduced changes however a study by researchers from the university of chicago also concluded that secretin was not an effective autism treatment and a total of 15 studies performed after sandlers study arrived at the same conclusion some of these studies also used children with both autism and gastrointestinal symptoms"},{"author":"Joshua Ferris","quote":"joshua ferris born 1974 is an american author best known for his debut 2007 novel then we came to the end

the dutch art forger han van meegerenlopez has written extensively on van meegeren in both dutch and english including an apollo article entitled han van meegerens early vermeers which revealed that van meegeren was behind three vermeer forgeries of the 1920s that had been floated on the international market by an organized ring of art swindlers based in london and berlin two of the three forgeries in question were purchased by the art dealer joseph duveen who then sold them in good faith to the great pittsburgh banker andrew mellon at the time mellon was serving as secretary of the treasury in the administration of president calvin coolidge unaware of his error mellon ultimately donated these two vermeers as part of his founding gift to the national gallery of art in washington dc they hung there through the 1960s as genuine works by johannes vermeer until technical analysis revealed them to be modern forgeries these works are now kept in storage and although rumors have existed about their true origins for many years they have never before been traced back definitively to van meegeren a figure far better known for his later exploits which included selling a fake vermeer to hermann gring at the height of world war iithe apollo article summarizes the conventional account of van meegerens career as follows as is fairly well known the government of the netherlands arrested van meegeren as a nazi collaborator at the end of the second world war charging that he had sold a priceless vermeer to gring during the german occupation when van meegeren revealed that he himself had painted grings prized masterpiece the news made him quite popular with the general public and his case was thereafter handled with kid gloves he only acknowledged forging the six biblically themed vermeers that the government already knew to be connected to him through the strawmen who had brought the works to market two pieter de hoochs sold in the same manner and a few unfinished items that remained in his atelier although confidential sources informed the investigative team working on the case that van meegeren had sold forgeries to englishmen and americans decades before the outbreak of hostilities the matter seems not to have received any official attentionsupporting his argument with archival documents and interviews with the descendents of van meegerens partners in crime lopez suggests that these rumors about van meegeren had a strong foundation in reality and indeed that much of what the forger said about himself in 1945 was untruthful not only was van meegeren a professional art forger for most of his adult life but he was also a fascist sympathizer going back as far as 1928 during the occupation van meegeren had created propagandistic artworks under his own name at the behest of the germaninstalled puppet government of the netherlands and even sent an admiring note to adolf hitler in 1942 as a token of esteem koen kleijn the art
