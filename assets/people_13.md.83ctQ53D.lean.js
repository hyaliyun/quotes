involved in the study of various aspects of the physics of ultracold atomic gases in addition they performed research on skyrmion lattices in the quantum hall effect and collective modes in supersolid 4he below the results obtained from the study of degenerate fermi gases are briefly summarizedalready in 1996 they predicted that an atomic gas of 6li a fermionic isotope of lithium becomes a bardeencooperschrieffer bcs superfluid at experimentally obtainable temperatures they have also performed a detailed study of the superfluid behaviour of this gas below the critical temperature motivated by this work at least six experimental groups from around the world including the groups of r grimm rg hulet ds jin and w ketterle started trying to achieve the necessary conditions for the bcs transition in 6liin the last seven years the study of superfluidity in fermi gases has been at the center of attention of the ultracold atoms community it is fair to say that the very successful experiments that ultimately have led to the creation of the superconductor with as a fraction of the fermi energy the highest critical temperature ever have only been possible due to the use of socalled feshbach resonances these resonances were theoretically codiscovered by htc stoof in the alkalis in 1993at that time the full potential of a feshbach resonance for studying the crossover from a bcs superconductor of boseeinstein condensed cooper pairs to a boseeinstein condensate bec of molecules was not realized yet but this crossover is now well understood due to the strong connection between experiment and ab initio theory that is possible in this field the group has made important contributions to the present understanding of how manybody physics affects the becbcs crossover and how to incorporate the twobody physics of the feshbach resonance exactly into the manybody theory henk stoof was elected as an aps fellow for these contributionsin the last three years the group of rg hulet at rice and the group of w ketterle at mit have pioneered the experimental study of spin imbalance on the superfluid state these experiments have especially concentrated on the strongly interacting or unitarity limit exactly at resonance where the attraction between the atoms is as large as quantum mechanics allows again the group of htc stoof made important contributions to this topic for example they were first to predict the topology of the universal phase diagram of this unitarity gas that is now confirmed by the experiments and that contains a tricritical temperature below which the gas phase separates between an almost equal density superfluid and a polarized normal gas making use of renormalization group techniques they are up to now the only theoretical group that has been able to accurately calculate this strongcoupling tricritical temperature from first principles they believe that an important reason for the success in this area of physics is that they have a background in both the microscopic atomic physics and in the macroscopic condensedmatter physics it is only through a combination of this knowledge that one can arrive at sophisticated manybody theories that can be directly compared with experiment without any fitting parameters"},{"author":"Jim Walton (baseball)","quote":"james robert walton born june 5 1934 at shattuck oklahoma is an

writings frequently question ironize or test the limits of the very critical methods being employed often in her writing a reversal will occur so that the critical vocabulary gets subjected to and converted into the terms of the literary or cultural object being scrutinized rather than simply settling the meaning of the object thus in felmans style of criticism there is no fixed hierarchy of theory over and beyond the reach of the literary object as such her methods share an affinity with deconstruction for which she is sometimes associated with the yale school and colleagues such as paul

not bound by any one sustained interest method or approach her writing is characterized by an expansive awareness use and engagement with contemporary theorists and criticsjacques lacan is a vital

tests leboyer graduated from the university of paris school of medicine his own birth was traumatic and without anesthetics available his mother had to be pinned down leboyer attributes his interest in birth to this experience leboyer is often mistaken as a proponent for water births although leboyers disciple michel odent became known for introducing birthing pools in hospitals as an option for lower lumbar pain management as a consequence water births were seen as a birthing method that he encouraged odent has stated that being submerged in water longer than 2 hours can decrease the progress of labor odent developed an effective method of reducing pain in the lower lumbar region informed by the gate control theory of pain odent injected sterile water underneath the skin surface in the lumbar region this technique produced a localized source of pain which in turn reduced the more severe regional pain women experienced in the lower lumbar region during labor because this method of nonpharmacological pain management could be viewed as too simple odent introduced the birthing pool which could deliver a similar form of pain management many sources mistakenly attribute a

incendiarypaint theory ipt which posits that the hindenburg disaster was caused by the electrical ignition of lacquer and metalbased paints used on the outer hull of the airship thus bain believes that the hydrogen in the airship had no part to play in the initiation of the disaster this theory which was proposed in 1997 and recently updated in his 2004 book the freedom element living with hydrogen has been generally accepted by people interested in promoting hydrogen as a transportation fuel and generally rejected by people involved with airships and their historybain attended flathead high school received his bachelor of science in space technology from florida institute of technology fit his master of science in systems management from fit and his phd in engineering management from ccuthe primary refutation is based on the work of a j dessler d e overs and w h appleby their work both theoretical and experimental has concluded that even if the airship were covered with solid rocket fuel as the incendiarypaint theory claims it would still have taken 12 hours for the airship to burn had hydrogen not been present it is worth noting that this refutation misses the point of the theory which relates only to what started the fire not how it continuedthe case for the incendiarypaint theory is explained in bains televised demonstration of the extreme flammability of a piece of the actual skin of the hindenburg preserved from the disaster bain demonstrates the incendiary properties of the hindenburg skin and then asks why the bits of skin ejected from the inferno continued to burn brightly on their way down instead of selfextinguishing once removed from the zone of densest hydrogen this question of selfextinguishing is important since his critics point out that the components of the doping compound used on the skin should put themselves out if removed from any fuel for fire and should not have burned so quickly if the fire actually started with the skin instead of the hydrogencritics also counter that bain did not actually ignite the skin with a quick electrical charge but instead uses a jacobs ladder with continuous electrical charge which required several strikes to ignite additionally bain was required to correctly position the fabric to allow it to ignite another part of the ipt hypothesizes that the mooring cables which were designed to ground any static electricity on the surface of the airship worked only partly in this instance since some of the skin panels still carried an electric charge at least one of them must have sparked causing the initial outbreak of fire thus it has yet to be proven that an electrical charge could ignite the hindenburg skin the design of the ship would likely exclude the skin being an ignition point due to the properties of the doping process the insulation from the frame and skin of the grounding droplines and the inability of any experiment to ignite the skin via electric spark consistent with the conditions of the 1937 disasterthe television show mythbusters also dedicated the opening episode for their 2007 season to bains theory scale models of the hindenburg were built and tested with skin reproductions one model had no hydrogen while the other did the only burn that replicated the hindenburg burn used hydrogen"},{"author":"Aya Hirayama","quote":"aya hirayama hirayama aya born
