Before automobiles existed, everyone had a horse. Then cars became available, and their convenience, compared to horses, was undeniable.</p><p>Dreams get you into the future and add excitement to the present.</p><p>I&#39;ve found that when the market&#39;s going down and you buy funds wisely, at some point in the future you will be happy. You won&#39;t get there by reading &#39;Now is the time to buy.&#39;</p><p>If GE&#39;s strategy of investment in China is wrong, it represents a loss of a billion dollars, perhaps a couple of billion dollars. If it is right, it is the future of this company for the next century.</p><p>My entire life has been an attempt to get back to the kind of feelings you have on a field. The sense of brotherhood, the esprit de corps, the focus - there being no past or future, just the ball. As trite as it sounds, I was happiest playing ball.</p><p>What has made America amazing has been the fact that throughout our history, throughout the more than 200 years of our history, there have been men and women of courage who stood up and decided it was more important to look out for the future of their children and their grandchildren than their own political futures.</p><p>The purpose of the Jewish state is to secure the Jewish future. That is why Israel must always have the ability to defend itself, against any threat.</p><p>There is still a future with music, because people want music.</p><p>Up against the corporate government, voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers. The money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust.</p><p>Language is the armory of the human mind, and at once contains the trophies of its past and the weapons of its future conquests.</p><p>President Obama believes in a country where we invest in education, in roads and bridges, in science, and in the future so we can create new opportunities so the next kid can make it big and the kid afer that and the kid after that, that&#39;s what President Obama believes.</p><p>I&#39;m convinced that we can shape a different future for this country as it relates to mental health and as it relates to suicide.</p><p>I would sum up my fear about the future in one word: boring. And that&#39;s my one fear: that everything has happened nothing exciting or new or interesting is ever going to happen again... the future is just going to be a vast, conforming suburb of the soul.</p><p>The more we shelter children from every disappointment, the more devastating future disappointments will be.</p><p>This is the first age that&#39;s ever paid much attention to the future, which is a little ironic since we may not have one.</p><p>The dark shadow we seem to see in the distance is not really a mountain ahead, but the shadow of the mountain behind - a shadow from the past thrown forward into our future. It is a dark sludge of historical sectarianism. We can leave it behind us if we wish.</p><p>We know that when people are safe in their homes, they are free to pursue their dream for a brighter economic future for themselves and their families.</p><p>Promises are the uniquely human way of ordering the future, making it predictable and reliable to the extent that this is humanly possible.</p><p>School is practice for the future, and practice makes perfect. But nobody&#39;s perfect, so why practice?</p><p>When two kids are being completely berserk, and they&#39;re naked and throwing food around, sometimes I just let it go because I can see a future where they&#39;re going to be dressed, and they&#39;re going to be at school. So I kind of let stuff go sometimes.</p><p>I&#39;ve said it before, but it&#39;s absolutely true: My mother gave me my drive, but my father gave me my dreams. Thanks to him, I could see a future.</p><p>In the future, instead of striving to be right at a high cost, it will be more appropriate to be flexible and plural at a lower cost. If you cannot accurately predict the future then you must flexibly be prepared to deal with various possible futures.</p><p>Every thought we think is creating our future.</p><p>I object to people running down the future. I am going to live all the rest of my life there.</p><p>I hate those e-books. They can not be the future... they may well be... I will be dead.</p><p>High expectations weren&#39;t nurtured in my neck of nowhere back then - children weren&#39;t fawned over from an early age as &#39;gifted&#39; and groomed for a prizewinning future self-esteem was considered something you had to pick from the garden yourself.</p><p>There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented, and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on.</p><p>After the Berlin Wall came down I visited that city and I will never forget it. The abandoned checkpoints. The sense of excitement about the future. The knowledge that a great continent was coming together. Healing those wounds of our history is the central story of the European Union.</p><p>I think I&#39;m going to be making country records for as long as I can see into the future. It&#39;s much more down-home and real.</p><p>President Obama has offered a plan with 4 trillion dollars in debt reduction over a decade, with two and a half dollars of spending reductions for every one dollar of revenue increases, and tight controls on future spending. It&#39;s the kind of balanced approach proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.</p><p>If you want a future of shared prosperity, where the middle class is growing and poverty is declining, where the American Dream is alive and well, and where the United States remains the leading force for peace and prosperity in a highly competitive world, you should vote for Barack Obama.</p><p>Frontiersmen good and bad, gunmen as well as inspired prophets of the future, have been my camp companions. Thus, I know the country of which I am about to write as few men now living have known it.</p><p>There are times when even the most potent governor must wink at transgression, in order to preserve the laws inviolate for the future.</p><p>The attack on ObamaCare was that Congress does not have the power under the Commerce Clause to force a private citizen into a private contractual relationship. If such a thing is permitted to stand, the anti-ObamaCare forces argue, there will be no limit to Congress&#39;s power in the future.</p><p>While negativity is politically useful, it is also demoralizing unless it is accompanied - and to some extent overshadowed - by elevated and inspiring ideas about the American future.</p><p>If I can create some space that people haven&#39;t experienced before and if it stays with them or gives them a dream for the future, that&#39;s the kind of structure I seek to create.</p><p>We must depend upon the Boy Scout Movement to produce the MEN of the future.</p><p>Fascism is not in itself a new order of society. It is the future refusing to be born.</p><p>Freedom is secured every day by our men and women in uniform. We must build a future worthy of their sacrifice.</p><p>A coldly rationalist individualist can deny that he has any obligation to make sacrifices for the future.</p><p>The future, like everything else, is not what it used to be.</p><p>After the final no there comes a yes and on that yes the future of the world hangs.</p><p>Scientific research and other studies have demonstrated that arts education can enhance American students&#39; math and language skills and improve test scores which in turn increase chances of higher education and good jobs in the future.</p><p>Traditionalists are pessimists about the future and optimists about the past.</p><p>Our politics are our deepest form of expression: they mirror our past experiences and reflect our dreams and aspirations for the future.</p><p>When you realize the value of all life, you dwell less on what is past and concentrate more on the preservation of the future.</p><p>The politics of partisanship and the resulting inaction and excuses have paralyzed decision-making, primarily at the federal level, and the big issues of the day are not being addressed, leaving our future in jeopardy.</p><p>To love someone is to isolate him from the world, wipe out every trace of him, dispossess him of his shadow, drag him into a murderous future. It is to circle around the other like a dead star and absorb him into a black light.</p><p>Young people can get very discouraged and get hooked on drugs or on alcohol because of problems they perceive as insurmountable. It is important that they realize a mistake need not ruin their future, but they must also know that not everything in life is a bed of roses.</p><p>As a child is indulged or checked in its early follies, a ground is generally laid for the happiness or misery of the future man.</p><p>I love wushu a lot and I would love to see it included in future Olympic Games.</p><p>An author is a fool who, not content with boring those he lives with, insists on boring future generations.</p><p>The global economic outlook remains fragile and uncertain. Global economic imbalances persist and we must address them or risk future instability.</p><p>The end of the trial and the &#39;not guilty&#39; verdicts on all counts, clearing Michael of all charges, mean that he can now concentrate on the future and his art.</p><p>Most of the media... is positioning the merger with Compaq and the recent actions by Walter Hewlett and David Packard as a fight between the past and the future.</p><p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to see the price of oil going down in the near future, that&#39;s the reality.</p><p>I hate those e-books. They cannot be the future. They may well be.</p><p>We must reinvent a future free of blinders so that we can choose from real options.</p><p>The best thing about the future is that it comes only one day at a time.</p><p>All cities do face similar, significant trends in the future... most importantly global warming and climate change.</p><p>It is hard to say what the future holds, but this is probable - it won&#39;t be just like the past.</p><p>I&#39;m sure that there are reasonable people that had some reasonable projections about the future of New Orleans, but none of those could include not trying to rebuild the city and make it better than it was before.</p><p>The social object of skilled investment should be to defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance which envelope our future.</p><p>The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a distance greater than the great circle of the earth. Where were we going now, and what was reserved for the future?</p><p>The White House isn&#39;t the place to learn how to deal with international crisis, the balance of power, war and peace, and the economic future of the next generation.</p><p>Our future cannot depend on the government alone. The ultimate solutions lie in the attitudes and the actions of the American people.</p><p>My future&#39;s about trying to be a better man.</p><p>I&#39;m pro-life. I&#39;ll do all I can to see every baby is created with a future and potential. The legislature should do all it can to protect human life.</p><p>I am neither a sociologist nor a politician. All I can do is imagine for myself what the future will be like.</p><p>I never think of the future. I never imagine what comes next.</p><p>I look forward to a time, in the not so distant future, when we no longer look forward to &#39;firsts&#39; as milestones women have yet to achieve, but we look back on them as historic events that continue to teach and inspire.</p><p>People talk about doom-laden scenarios happening in the future: they are happening in Africa now. You can see it perfectly clearly. Periodic famines are due to too many people living on land that can&#39;t sustain them.</p><p>We do not know enough about how the present will lead into the future.</p><p>The Fuhrer alone is the present and future German reality and its law. Learn to know ever more deeply: from now on every single thing demands decision, and every action responsibility.</p><p>We would fight not for the political future of a distant city, rather for principles whose destruction would ruin the possibility of peace and security for the peoples of the earth.</p><p>More is required of public officials than slogans and handshakes and press releases. More is required. We must hold ourselves strictly accountable. We must provide the people with a vision of the future.</p><p>I honestly don&#39;t know, but if America continues to refuse to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, I see a bleak future not only for American society, but for the world as a whole. This is a global problem that is not going away, and the United States is an obstacle to solving it.</p><p>I just can&#39;t wait for the future.</p><p>Inspiring scenes of people taking the future of their countries into their own hands will ignite greater demands for good governance and political reform elsewhere in the world, including in Asia and in Africa.</p><p>The EU is not a country and it&#39;s not going to become a country, in my view, now or ever in the future. It is a group of countries working together.</p><p>The Christian of the future will be a mystic or he will not exist at all.</p><p>America&#39;s future will be determined by the home and the school. The child becomes largely what he is taught hence we must watch what we teach, and how we live.</p><p>And that&#39;s how we build the economy of the future. An economy with more jobs and less debt, we root it in fairness. We grow it with opportunity. And we build it together.</p><p>Adolescence represents an inner emotional upheaval, a struggle between the eternal human wish to cling to the past and the equally powerful wish to get on with the future.</p><p>John wrote with a very deep love for the human race and a concern for its future.</p><p>I have been judged to be a pessimist but what abyss of ignorance and low egoism is not hidden in one who thinks that Man is the god of himself and that his future can only be triumphant?</p><p>You can&#39;t let your past hold your future hostage.</p><p>We&#39;re not planning for the future. If we continue to spend ourselves into oblivion, we are going to destroy this nation.</p><p>Man has a limited biological capacity for change. When this capacity is overwhelmed, the capacity is in future shock.</p><p>One faces the future with one&#39;s past.</p><p>As a kid, I&#39;d go into the bathroom when I was having a tantrum. I&#39;d be in the bathroom crying, studying myself in the mirror. I was preparing for future roles.</p><p>It is the business of the future to be dangerous and it is among the merits of science that it equips the future for its duties.</p><p>The task of a university is the creation of the future, so far as rational thought and civilized modes of appreciation can affect the issue.</p><p>I&#39;d like to think that the actions we take today will allow others in the future to discover the wonders of landscapes we helped protect but never had the chance to enjoy ourselves.</p><p>A lot of people, including business leaders, think the future belongs to China. Globalization is not a zero-sum game, but we need to hone our skills to stay in play.</p><p>A globalized world is by now a familiar fact of life. Building walls or moats may sound appealing, but the future belongs to those who tend to their people and then boldly engage the rest of the world, near and far.</p><p>You control your future, your destiny. What you think about comes about. By recording your dreams and goals on paper, you set in motion the process of becoming the person you most want to be. Put your future in good hands - your own.</p><p>In retrospect, the Millennium marked only a moment in time. It was the events of September 11 that marked a turning point in history, where we confront the dangers of the future and assess the choices facing humankind.</p><p>In a time of tight budgets, difficult choices have to be made. We must make sure our very limited resources are spent on priorities. I believe we should have no higher priority than investing in our children&#39;s classrooms and in their future.</p><p>For all my years in public life, I have believed that America must sail toward the shores of liberty and justice for all. There is no end to that journey, only the next great voyage. We know the future will outlast all of us, but I believe that all of us will live on in the future we make.</p><p>My own nature hovers between neurotic and paranoid. I&#39;ve developed the habit of mentally listing things that make me optimistic about the future. I do it every day.</p><p>Anything you&#39;re trying to will is focused on the future it&#39;s always associated with some sort of anxiety that makes the present moment somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p>Future orientation is combined with a notion and expectation of progress, and nothing is impossible.</p><p>Together we can and must fight for justice for our children and protect them from draconian tax cuts and budget choices that threaten their survival, education and preparation for the future. If they are not ready for tomorrow, neither is America.</p><p>Why does everyone think the future is space helmets, silver foil, and talking like computers, like a bad episode of Star Trek?</p><p>Isn&#39;t it a shame that future generations can&#39;t be here to see all the wonderful things we&#39;re doing with their money?</p><p>A lost election can have the jolt of a drop through the gallows door, leading to a dark night of the soul in which the future presses down like a cloud that will never lift.</p><p>As we divest ourselves of once familiar physical objects - digitize and dematerialize - we approach a &#39;Star Trek&#39; future in which everything can be accessed from the fourth dimension with a few clicks or terse audibles.</p><p>In rising financial markets, the world is forever new. The bull or optimist has no eyes for past or present, but only for the future, where streams of revenue play in his imagination.</p><p>For 50 years, nuclear power stations have produced three products which only a lunatic could want: bomb-explosive plutonium, lethal radioactive waste and electricity so dear it has to be heavily subsidised. They leave to future generations the task, and most of the cost, of making safe sites that have been polluted half-way to eternity.</p><p>For my future I have no concern, and as a true philosopher, I never would have any, for I know not what it may be: as a Christian, on the other hand, faith must believe without discussion, and the stronger it is, the more it keeps silent.</p><p>I launched The Emeril Lagasse Foundation to provide culinary training, and developmental and educational programs to children in the cities where my restaurants operate. I think everyone has a responsibility to give back to the community if they can, and to help future generations learn new skills.</p><p>The future is a bright as the promises of God.</p><p>The future battle on the ground will be preceded by battle in the air. This will determine which of the contestants has to suffer operational and tactical disadvantages and be forced throughout the battle into adoption compromise solutions.</p><p>You mustn&#39;t take what I say as gospel because no one can second-guess the future.</p><p>Seek not to know what must not be reveal, for joy only flows where fate is most concealed. A busy person would find their sorrows much more if future fortunes were known before!</p><p>Existence is no more than the precarious attainment of relevance in an intensely mobile flux of past, present, and future.</p><p>I do not think white America is committed to granting equality to the American Negro. This is a passionately racist country it will continue to be so in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Africa has no future.</p><p>We have a positive vision of the future founded on the belief that the gap between the promise and reality of America can one day be finally closed. We believe that.</p><p>A government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation.</p><p>The security and the future of Jordan is hand-in-hand with the future of the Palestinians and the Israelis.</p><p>Such is the miraculous nature of the future of exiles: what is first uttered in the impotence of an overheated apartment becomes the fate of nations.</p><p>Planning ahead is a measure of class. The rich and even the middle class plan for future generations, but the poor can plan ahead only a few weeks or days.</p><p>Sometime in the future - 25, 50, 75 years hence - what will the situation be like then? By that time the Chinese will have the capability of delivery too.</p><p>Life... is not simply a series of exciting new ventures. The future is not always a whole new ball game. There tends to be unfinished business. One trails all sorts of things around with one, things that simply won&#39;t be got rid of.</p><p>Live life to the fullest, for the future is scarce.</p><p>The Republican argument that raising the debt ceiling encourages additional future spending is logically irresponsible. The debt ceiling has to be raised to authorize spending already approved by Congress. Despite that fallacy, the GOP has been able to score political points with its argument.</p><p>The earth we abuse and the living things we kill will, in the end, take their revenge for in exploiting their presence we are diminishing our future.</p><p>The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history, like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past, the record of truths revealed by experience, is eminently practical, as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.</p><p>Really, each era has its own false nostalgia. We all put a picket fence up around something. For my generation it was the &#39;50s, and for other generations it will be something else. Change is scary for everyone, as is complexity, contradiction, and an uncertain future.</p><p>I&#39;d love to do more action stuff, in the future.</p><p>It is difficult to live in the present, ridiculous to live in the future and impossible to live in the past. Nothing is as far away as one minute ago.</p><p>My kids are the future of the Mayweather family and of the Mayweather brand. I feel our family is stronger if we stay together.</p><p>You have reckoned that history ought to judge the past and to instruct the contemporary world as to the future. The present attempt does not yield to that high office. It will merely tell how it really was.</p><p>The flesh endures the storms of the present alone the mind, those of the past and future as well as the present. Gluttony is a lust of the mind.</p><p>I think Gingrich has embarrassed the party over time. Whether he&#39;ll do it again in the future, I don&#39;t know. But Gov. Romney never has.</p><p>Since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to learn whatever needs to be learned.</p><p>We are all afraid for our confidence, for the future, for the world. That is the nature of the human imagination. Yet every man, every civilization, has gone forward because of its engagement with what it has set itself to do.</p><p>I feel like I write songs for the future or something. Not in an arrogant way, but I feel like maybe my songs were, like, before their time or something.</p><p>I never remember having a plan. All I could think about was how I was going to afford to get into college or where I was going to stay because I hated being at home. I didn&#39;t really have time to think about anything in the future. I didn&#39;t think about a career or anything. I went to uni, got a couple of jobs, so I sort of funded it myself.</p><p>I never have plans for the future as you never know how things will turn out.</p><p>But I think it&#39;s more that when you&#39;re young, you&#39;re invincible, you&#39;re immortal - or at least you think you are. The possibilities are limitless, you&#39;re inventing the future. Then you get older and suddenly you have a history. It&#39;s fixed. You can&#39;t change anything. I find that a bit disturbing, to be honest.</p><p>Comedy was the key to everything. I grew up fast and controlled my future by bringing it on faster than it naturally unfolded. I cheated myself out of a childhood but then got a running headstart into adulthood that no one else could keep up with.</p><p>It&#39;s been a difficult thing because some great opportunities have come and I&#39;ve just been holding my breath and praying... I&#39;m basically gambling hoping something will come along this season and if not, I don&#39;t know what the future holds.</p><p>Just, you never know what the next day is going to bring. That goes for football, goes for off the field, and I gave up a long time ago trying to predict the future and trying to deal with things I couldn&#39;t deal with.</p><p>I stopped thinking about it after trying to figure out what are the lessons learned, and there are so many. After I had basically sorted that out, I figured it&#39;s time to really look at the future and not at the past.</p><p>I stopped predicting the future a long time ago.</p><p>If we are to better the future we must disturb the present.</p><p>I don&#39;t have that much forward planning about what I want to do next, or in the future.</p><p>I knew I could not cope with the future unless I was able to rediscover the past.</p><p>If other people want to talk about my future I can&#39;t control that.</p><p>Life is an operation which is done in a forward direction. One lives toward the future, because to live consists inexorably in doing, in each individual life making itself.</p><p>Men don&#39;t come up to you to just talk. We come up to you with a plan. We&#39;re looking across the room at you, and we don&#39;t care about your hopes and dreams. We don&#39;t care about what your future holds. We saw something we wanted.</p><p>The future depends entirely on what each of us does every day a movement is only people moving.</p><p>In an ecology of love, people can relate in trust and face the future without fear. They do not need to play it safe. They can take uncertainty in their stride.</p><p>While everyone else is thinking about economics and politics, executive salaries and the future of the euro, do the opposite, even if it&#39;s hard. Invest in the spirit.</p><p>A perfect storm is in the making: financial uncertainty, economic downturn, government cuts, rising unemployment and a future that looks less clear the more we try to fathom it.</p><p>While we can remember the past, we cannot write the future. Only our children, the future of our community, can do that.</p><p>Instead of seeing these children for the blessings that they are, we are measuring them only by the standard of whether they will be future deficits or assets for our nation&#39;s competitive needs.</p><p>Not many people give you a vision of what the future will bring.</p><p>If you really want change, you really want it to be inclusive, where everyone&#39;s included, otherwise you&#39;re just going to have more of the same in the future.</p><p>You can get your money and you put it in the bank, or you can put it in the youth. You can put it in our future.</p><p>The Freudian theory is one of the most important foundation stones for an edifice to be built by future generations, the dwelling of a freer and wiser humanity.</p><p>The past is really almost as much a work of the imagination as the future.</p><p>My commitment to the security and future of Israel is based upon basic morality as well as enlightened self-interest. Our role in supporting Israel honors our own heritage.</p><p>I plant a lot of trees. I am a great believer in planting things for future generations. I loathe the now culture where you just live for today.</p><p>The future of Conservatism lies in our beliefs and values, not by throwing them away. We need to shed associations that bind us to past failures, but hold faith with those things that make us Conservatives.</p><p>When you try to predict future E.R.A.&#39;s with past E.R.A.&#39;s, you&#39;re making a mistake.</p><p>When a scientist is ahead of his times, it is often through misunderstanding of current, rather than intuition of future truth. In science there is never any error so gross that it won&#39;t one day, from some perspective, appear prophetic.</p><p>There are certain moments when we might wish the future were built by men of the past.</p><p>What else does anxiety about the future bring you but sorrow upon sorrow?</p><p>Here once again education is crucial, it enables children to be become more aware of their rights and to exercise them in a respectful manner which helps them shape their own future.</p><p>We are, perhaps, uniquely among the earth&#39;s creatures, the worrying animal. We worry away our lives, fearing the future, discontent with the present, unable to take in the idea of dying, unable to sit still.</p><p>Doctors, dressed up in one professional costume or another, have been in busy practice since the earliest records of every culture on earth. It is hard to think of a more dependable or enduring occupation, harder still to imagine any future events leading to its extinction.</p><p>At this early stage in our evolution, now through our infancy and into our childhood and then, with luck, our growing up, what our species needs most of all, right now, is simply a future.</p><p>The future is too interesting and dangerous to be entrusted to any predictable, reliable agency. We need all the fallibility we can get. Most of all, we need to preserve the absolute unpredictability and total improbability of our connected minds. That way we can keep open all the options, as we have in the past.</p><p>When I was a kid, I thought movie stars were women and men who were in these great films that we still look at now. But I don&#39;t think there are too many films coming out these days that we&#39;re going to look at in the future and say, &#39;This is one of the great ones.&#39;</p><p>The debt-ceiling vote isn&#39;t about what will be done in the future it is about the integrity of America&#39;s commitment to support the bonds we issue. Elected officials have an obligation to maintain that integrity, regardless of whether they voted for the programs that required the borrowing in the first place.</p><p>We can do things the cheap way, the simple way, for the short-term and without regard for the future. Or, we can make the extra effort, do the hard work, absorb the criticism and make decisions that will cause a better future.</p><p>Every great work of art has two faces, one toward its own time and one toward the future, toward eternity.</p><p>Children are our future we must take care of them with maximum effort.</p><p>I could definitely see myself making a serious movie or a drama in the future.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what the future holds. Anything is possible.</p><p>What unites Oklahomans today is what has always united us: Our unshakable faith. Our love of family and compassion for others. The unlimited promise of a hopeful future.</p><p>To communicate the truths of history is an act of hope for the future.</p><p>A healthy vision of the future is not possible without an accurate knowledge of the past.</p><p>No one is going to try to fill my mother&#39;s shoes, what she did was fantastic. It&#39;s about making your own future and your own destiny and Kate will do a very good job of that.</p><p>Kids are meeting in coffee shops and basements figuring out what&#39;s unsustainable in their communities. That&#39;s the future.</p><p>Fear of the future is worse than one&#39;s present fortune.</p><p>Reactionary: a man walking backwards with his face to the future.</p><p>We are a people in a quandary about the present. We are a people in search of our future. We are a people in search of a national community.</p><p>We are a party of innovation. We do not reject our traditions, but we are willing to adapt to changing circumstances, when change we must. We are willing to suffer the discomfort of change in order to achieve a better future.</p><p>We must not become the new puritans and reject our society. We must address and master the future together. It can be done if we restore the belief that we share a sense of national community, that we share a common national endeavor. It can be done.</p><p>I am only 33, I&#39;ve got a lot to do. This is the first half of my career. I&#39;m looking forward to the future and I&#39;m proud about the past.</p><p>I don&#39;t think anybody anywhere can talk about the future of their people or of an organization without talking about education. Whoever controls the education of our children controls our future.</p><p>What we&#39;re discussing privately and publicly, is a budget which is a blueprint for the future which creates jobs, which educates our children, which provides healthcare for all Americans, which takes our deficit down, which gives a tax cut for 95% of the American people.</p><p>Blowing up buses will not induce the Israelis to move forward, and neither will the killing of Palestinians or the demolition of their homes and their future.

Their future children deserve the opportunity to grow up in financially and emotionally stable homes. Our communities benefit from healthy, productive, well-prepared young people.</p><p>It&#39;s about time we make the well-being of our young people more important than ideology and politics. As a country, we benefit from investing in their future by investing in teen pregnancy prevention.</p><p>I&#39;m not certain, but I have a little gypsy blood in me. And my mother always told me that her grandma could give someone the evil eye, and I&#39;d better not cross her because she had some of that blood in her. Mother always believed that she could predict the future, and she had dreams that came true.</p><p>Ensuring quality higher education is one of the most important things we can do for future generations.</p><p>The most important thing about global warming is this. Whether humans are responsible for the bulk of climate change is going to be left to the scientists, but it&#39;s all of our responsibility to leave this planet in better shape for the future generations than we found it.</p><p>To live only for some future goal is shallow. It&#39;s the sides of the mountain that sustain life, not the top.</p><p>Habitual texters may not only cheat their existing relationships, they can also limit their ability to form future ones since they don&#39;t get to practice the art of interpreting nonverbal visual cues.</p><p>The future... seems to me no unified dream but a mince pie, long in the baking, never quite done.</p><p>There&#39;s no point in making predictions. It&#39;s not worth speculating because nothing is set in stone and things change all the time in football. Today there are opportunities that no one knows if they will come round again in the future.</p><p>What should be the future of Israel? Is the land the most important choice, and for that reason to keep the whole of the land at any cost, or to have a partition and build the Jewish state on part of the land? And the other part?</p><p>The Super Bowl is a game. Life is for real. What I went through helped me get to where I am today. I won&#39;t forget. I can&#39;t forget.

The suburbanisation of the planet will continue, and the suburbanisation of the soul will follow soon after.</p><p>I came to live in Shepperton in 1960. I thought: the future isn&#39;t in the metropolitan areas of London. I want to go out to the new suburbs, near the film studios. This was the England I wanted to write about, because this was the new world that was emerging.</p><p>That is now my mission: to provide a European vision of growth, employment, prosperity - in one word, our future.</p><p>Between France and Senegal there&#39;s a history. There&#39;s a language that we both speak. There&#39;s a culture that we share and to which both of our peoples have contributed. But beyond our history, beyond our language, beyond the links that have united us for so long, what unites us today is the future.</p><p>We need the help of other member countries and leaders who, like us, want to see a change in Europe&#39;s direction. That&#39;s also my logic when I tell voters that electing me president will not only shape France&#39;s future, but also initiate change across all of Europe.</p><p>There are hurdles, there are handicaps, hardships you have to face in life, but you hope for a great future.</p><p>The impressions of the spriritual experiences gave my future life its form and content.</p><p>Rather than waiting for future trials to determine rules that will impact every citizen, Congress should step in and write a law that takes every American&#39;s rights into consideration.</p><p>The fact is that all writers create their precursors. Their work modifies our conception of the past, just as it is bound to modify the future.</p><p>I think the future also will not belong to those who are cynical or those who stand on the sidelines.</p><p>The future will belong to those who have passion and are willing to work hard to make our country better.</p><p>In particular, for younger researchers on whom the future of mankind may depend. We believe that they are working with all the scientific wisdom at their disposal for the preservation of the inheritance of the earth and for the lasting survival of mankind.</p><p>I think there&#39;s a future where the Web and print coexist and they each do things uniquely and complement each other, and we have what could be the ultimate and best-yet array of journalistic venues.</p><p>I think it&#39;s very clear that the American people are frustrated with this move toward socialism. And so whether you&#39;re back or white, if you believe that the conservative construct is in the best interest of our future, than you too would be voting with Republicans, and if you had the opportunity to run you&#39;d join us as well.</p><p>The claim made by Team Obama that every dollar in stimulus translates into a dollar-and-a-half in growth is economic fiction. The costs of stimulus reduce future growth. No country has ever spent itself to prosperity. The price of stimulus has to be paid sometime.</p><p>I&#39;ve been asked to do a retrospective since I was about 28 and I always thought that was a bit odd. It&#39;s great to look forward as an artist because in the future the possibilities are infinite you look back and it&#39;s all fixed so it&#39;s a scary thing.</p><p>The idea of going on tour for the rest of my life with old works is not that exciting. As an artist I definitely think the work in future is going to be better than the work in the past, otherwise why do it?</p><p>Everything that looks to the future elevates human nature.</p><p>I was the true future. I understood Communism better than they did.</p><p>The law of humanity ought to be composed of the past, the present, and the future, that we bear within us whoever possesses but one of these terms, has but a fragment of the law of the moral world.</p><p>The purpose of thinking about the future is not to predict it but to raise people&#39;s hopes.</p><p>I see a bright future for the biotechnology industry when it follows the path of the computer industry, the path that von Neumann failed to foresee, becoming small and domesticated rather than big and centralized.</p><p>You want to do your job well so that people in the future say, &#39;OK, he&#39;s not bad, let&#39;s hire him.&#39;</p><p>AARP knows the future is bright for a generation that&#39;s going to remain healthy and vital for 10, 20, 30, 40 more years.

Instead, we need a high standards, mandatory curriculum to get all our students on the road to higher education and a good paying job.</p><p>Well, clearly, for me in the immediate future, it is grappling, like so many other governors are grappling, with the economic woes of these states. We were all hoping to see some federal relief.</p><p>The civil unrest of recent days must come to an end, and the healing process must begin for the future of the community. We will provide assistance both in ending the violence and enabling the healing process in Benton Harbor.</p><p>That&#39;s one of the most exciting things about Michigan&#39;s future.

I want to write all the songs!</p><p>Every educated person is a future enemy.</p><p>Cartooning is a wonderful career, and I&#39;d like more women to get to have it. I can&#39;t think of any reason why we won&#39;t see more syndicated female cartoonists in the future.</p><p>The fighter loses more than his pride in the fight he loses part of his future. He&#39;s a step closer to the slum he came from.</p><p>The future has a way of arriving unannounced.</p><p>Yeah, it&#39;s odd when you look back at your own work. Some filmmakers don&#39;t look back at their work at all. I look at my work a lot, actually. I feel like I learned something while looking at stuff I&#39;ve done in terms of what I&#39;m going to do in the future, mistakes I&#39;ve made and things at work or what have you.</p><p>I would tell 17-year-olds to be proud of who you are.

Is it because we&#39;re too afraid to really examine the system, or is it because we really truly believe that this is the best way to deter future crime?</p><p>A speculator is a man who observes the future, and acts before it occurs.</p><p>There is no word for feeling nostalgic about the future, but that&#39;s what a parent&#39;s tears often are, a nostalgia for something that has not yet occurred.

Future job and economic growth in industry, defense, transportation, agriculture, health care, and life sciences is directly related to scientific advancement.</p><p>No other investment yields as great a return as the investment in education. An educated workforce is the foundation of every community and the future of every economy.</p><p>The best prophet of the future is the past.</p><p>The American idea is as promising, imaginative, and full of the unexpected as the land itself.

Granted, there will always be people doing something different and there are a lot of possibilities.</p><p>I can count all the ways in which being a mother has enriched my understanding of the world, of character, my sense of the future and my attachment to it.

We&#39;re all trying to help the world... make it a better place to live. We&#39;re actually still changing the world, aren&#39;t we?</p><p>I have long considered it one of God&#39;s greatest mercies that the future is hidden from us. If it were not, life would surely be unbearable.</p><p>I think experience will teach you a combination of liberalism and conservatism.

It&#39;s one day at a time.</p><p>The Arab World is writing a new future the pen is in our own hands.</p><p>Blade Runner appears regularly, two or three times a year in various shapes and forms of science fiction.

I didn&#39;t think it was anything serious because years ago I felt a lump and it was benign. I assumed this would be too.

I come through it and I grow from it, because He has got me.</p><p>So someday in the near future hopefully rather than having a foot or a leg amputated we&#39;ll just give you an injection of the cells and restore the blood flow. We&#39;ve also created entire tubes of red blood cells from scratch in the laboratory. So there are a lot of exciting things in the pipeline.</p><p>In fact when you combine stem cell technology with the technology known as tissue engineering you can actually grow up entire organs, so as you suggest that sometime in the future you get in an auto accident and lose your kidney, we&#39;d simply take a few skin cells and grow you up a new kidney. In fact this has already been done.</p><p>I would say that there is no future for literary studies as such in the United States.</p><p>I see Turkey&#39;s future as being in Europe, as one of many prosperous, tolerant, democratic countries.</p><p>Kids feel so strongly about what&#39;s going on today and what&#39;s happening to the world, and that&#39;s very inspiring.

If you know anything about the Nords, they don&#39;t look like me but there you go. I think that&#39;s a sign of the times for the future. I think we will see multi-level casting. I think we will see that, and I think that&#39;s good.</p><p>If we want to deliver opportunity for all, we need an economy that delivers jobs for the future.</p><p>We inadvertently bombed the Chinese Embassy.

I find the death of a young person the most difficult and painful of times. To explain it to other young people, to see a bright future snuffed out, is just awful. I am haunted by those deaths.</p><p>Future generations are not going to ask us what political party were you in. They are going to ask what did you do about it, when you knew the glaciers were melting.</p><p>I was offered a choice of a flat salary up front or a percentage of the film&#39;s future earnings. I took the up front money. Nobody could have figured what Halloween would ultimately become.</p><p>You will attract the younger generation and they might well prove tougher than the older generation.

And I just couldn&#39;t quite accept that.</p><p>The ongoing conflict between us has caused heavy suffering to both peoples. The future can and must be different. Both our peoples are destined to live together side by side, on this small piece of land. This reality we cannot change.</p><p>But there&#39;s one thing we are not going to compromise at all: when it comes to security of Israeli citizens and the State of Israel, there are not going to be any compromises - not now and not in the future.</p><p>My future is in my past and my past is my present. I must now make the present my future.</p><p>To the citizens of Israel, I say: we have passed difficult years, faced the most painful experiences and overcame them. The future lies before us.

I like being at home and I&#39;m very happy being in my house, I love cooking.</p><p>I have to keep up with the scientific literature as part of my job, but increasingly I found myself reading things that weren&#39;t really relevant to my academic work, but were relevant to gardening.</p><p>I don&#39;t hold that everybody has to love fashion.

God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls.</p><p>When the solution is simple, God is answering.</p><p>While I know myself as a creation of God, I am also obligated to realize and remember that everyone else and everything else are also God&#39;s creation.</p><p>Never trust anyone completely but God. Love people, but put your full trust only in God.</p><p>I believe God is managing affairs and that He doesn&#39;t need any advice from me. With God in charge, I believe everything will work out for the best in the end. So what is there to worry about.</p><p>God and Nature first made us what we are, and then out of our own created genius we make ourselves what we want to be. Follow always that great law. Let the sky and God be our limit and Eternity our measurement.</p><p>The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be.</p><p>God, as Truth, has been for me a treasure beyond price. May He be so to every one of us.</p><p>The Christian life is not a constant high. I have my moments of deep discouragement. I have to go to God in prayer with tears in my eyes, and say, &#39;O God, forgive me,&#39; or &#39;Help me.&quot;</p><p>The moment I have realized God sitting in the temple of every human body, the moment I stand in reverence before every human being and see God in him - that moment I am free from bondage, everything that binds vanishes, and I am free.</p><p>Each one prays to God according to his own light.</p><p>God is, even though the whole world deny him. Truth stands, even if there be no public support. It is self-sustained.</p><p>God will not permit any troubles to come upon us, unless He has a specific plan by which great blessing can come out of the difficulty.</p><p>God gave you a gift of 86,400 seconds today. Have you used one to say &#39;thank you?&#39;</p><p>God has given us two hands, one to receive with and the other to give with.</p><p>God creates out of nothing. Wonderful you say. Yes, to be sure, but he does what is still more wonderful: he makes saints out of sinners.</p><p>Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God trust also in me.</p><p>The Bible is one of the greatest blessings bestowed by God on the children of men. It has God for its author salvation for its end, and truth without any mixture for its matter. It is all pure.</p><p>The blame is his who chooses: God is blameless.</p><p>My message is that God is a good God.</p><p>God who is eternally complete, who directs the stars, who is the master of fates, who elevates man from his lowliness to Himself, who speaks from the cosmos to every single human soul, is the most brilliant manifestation of the goal of perfection.</p><p>I cannot think that we are useless or God would not have created us. There is one God looking down on us all. We are all the children of one God. The sun, the darkness, the winds are all listening to what we have to say.</p><p>There&#39;s only one effectively redemptive sacrifice, the sacrifice of self-will to make room for the knowledge of God.</p><p>If thou desire the love of God and man, be humble, for the proud heart, as it loves none but itself, is beloved of none but itself. Humility enforces where neither virtue, nor strength, nor reason can prevail.</p><p>God is looking for people to use, and if you can get usable, he will wear you out. The most dangerous prayer you can pray is this: &#39;Use me.&#39;</p><p>God&#39;s truth judges created things out of love, and Satan&#39;s truth judges them out of envy and hatred.</p><p>We are either in the process of resisting God&#39;s truth or in the process of being shaped and molded by his truth.</p><p>Start with God - the first step in learning is bowing down to God only fools thumb their noses at such wisdom and learning.</p><p>God hangs the greatest weights upon the smallest wires.</p><p>Every creature is a word of God.</p><p>At the cross God wrapped his heart in flesh and blood and let it be nailed to the cross for our redemption.</p><p>Knowledge of God&#39;s Word is a bulwark against deception, temptation, accusation, even persecution.</p><p>Reason is God&#39;s crowning gift to man.</p><p>If you believe in God, He will open the windows of heaven and pour blessings upon you.</p><p>God loves to help him who strives to help himself.</p><p>When trouble comes, focus on God&#39;s ability to care for you.</p><p>God lends a helping hand to the man who tries hard.</p><p>God always strives together with those who strive.</p><p>After all, God is God because he remembers.</p><p>Each one of us is an outlet to God and an inlet to God.</p><p>God gave me life to continue to do things that I would never have done.</p><p>The way to be with God in every season is to strive to be near Him every week and each day.</p><p>I only answer to two people, myself and God.</p><p>If you must be mad, be it not for the things of the world. Be mad with the love of God.</p><p>Every morning I wake up and thank God.</p><p>One must be very particular about telling the truth.

Therein we may learn, what God is.</p><p>But I know God has big stuff planned that ultimately doesn&#39;t have anything to do with me.</p><p>God in His wisdom has decided that He will reward no works but His own.</p><p>Sometimes God writes straightforward in twisted lines.</p><p>God the Father and God the Son cannot be everywhere present indeed they cannot be even in two places at the same instant: but God the Holy Spirit is omnipresent - it extends through all space, with all other matter.</p><p>Even God lends a hand to honest boldness.</p><p>I think that anything that begins to give people a sense of their own worth and dignity is God.</p><p>Your God is ever beside you - indeed, He is even within you.</p><p>A thick skin is a gift from God.</p><p>The Bible is not man&#39;s word about God, but God&#39;s word about man.</p><p>Adoration is caring for God above all else.</p><p>The world sees in our conduct, in our behaviour, the proof that we are the real children of God.</p><p>God is creating at every moment of the world&#39;s existence in and through the perpetually endowed creativity of the very stuff of the world.</p><p>They always win who side with God.</p><p>God is one, greatest of gods and men, not like mortals in body or thought.</p><p>God is the tangential point between zero and infinity.</p><p>Throughout life people will make you mad, disrespect you and treat you bad.

History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners, and necessity has made us allies. Those whom God has so joined together, let no man put asunder.</p><p>Talent is God given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful.</p><p>Question with boldness even the existence of a God because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear.</p><p>God didn&#39;t make a mistake when He made you. You need to see yourself as God sees you.</p><p>God is an unutterable sigh, planted in the depths of the soul.</p><p>Our prayers should be for blessings in general, for God knows best what is good for us.</p><p>God will never give you anything you can&#39;t handle, so don&#39;t stress.</p><p>There is always the danger that we may just do the work for the sake of the work. This is where the respect and the love and the devotion come in - that we do it to God, to Christ, and that&#39;s why we try to do it as beautifully as possible.</p><p>Surely God would not have created such a being as man, with an ability to grasp the infinite, to exist only for a day! No, no, man was made for immortality.</p><p>It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those three unspeakably precious things: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and the prudence never to practice either of them.</p><p>I try to give to the poor people for love what the rich could get for money. No, I wouldn&#39;t touch a leper for a thousand pounds yet I willingly cure him for the love of God.</p><p>Keep a good attitude and do the right thing even when it&#39;s hard.

Both may be, and one must be wrong.</p><p>I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.</p><p>Our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself. Only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love God better because of them.</p><p>God, our Creator, has stored within our minds and personalities, great potential strength and ability. Prayer helps us tap and develop these powers.</p><p>God made the Idiot for practice, and then He made the School Board.</p><p>We can be tired, weary and emotionally distraught, but after spending time alone with God, we find that He injects into our bodies energy, power and strength.</p><p>God proved His love on the Cross.

That&#39;s what I see.</p><p>The Word of God well understood and religiously obeyed is the shortest route to spiritual perfection.

I have so much wrong with me, it&#39;s unbelievable!</p><p>One of the peculiar sins of the twentieth century which we&#39;ve developed to a very high level is the sin of credulity. It has been said that when human beings stop believing in God they believe in nothing. The truth is much worse: they believe in anything.</p><p>We have come to a turning point in the road. If we turn to the right mayhap our children and our children&#39;s children will go that way but if we turn to the left, generations yet unborn will curse our names for having been unfaithful to God and to His Word.</p><p>How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god.</p><p>The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.</p><p>I will govern my life and thoughts as if the whole world were to see the one and read the other, for what does it signify to make anything a secret to my neighbor, when to God, who is the searcher of our hearts, all our privacies are open?</p><p>God lets you be successful because he trusts you that you will do the right thing with it. Now, does he get disappointed often? All the time, because people get there and they forget how they got it.</p><p>God made man to go by motives, and he will not go without them, any more than a boat without steam or a balloon without gas.</p><p>There are joys which long to be ours.

A physics, a biology where there is a God is bound to look different. So the most basic claims of religion are scientific.

He comprises all things. He is the fountain of all being. In Him exists everything that is.</p><p>There&#39;s a tremendous difference between alone and lonely. You could be lonely in a group of people. I like being alone. I like eating by myself. I go home at night and just watch a movie or hang out with my dog. I have to exert myself and really say, oh God, I&#39;ve got to see my friends &#39;cause I&#39;m too content being by myself.</p><p>To you I&#39;m an atheist to God, I&#39;m the Loyal Opposition.</p><p>Forgetfulness - a gift of God bestowed upon debtors in compensation for their destitution of conscience.</p><p>The Bible is clear - God&#39;s definition of marriage is between a man and a woman.</p><p>God put me on this earth to accomplish a certain number of things. Right now I am so far behind that I will never die.</p><p>Behold a worthy sight, to which the God, turning his attention to his own work, may direct his gaze.

To God we are Everything.</p><p>I may be as bad as the worst, but, thank God, I am as good as the best.</p><p>It is the heart which perceives God and not the reason. That is what faith is: God perceived by the heart, not by the reason.</p><p>God has entrusted me with myself.</p><p>I grow daily to honour facts more and more, and theory less and less. A fact, it seems to me, is a great thing a sentence printed, if not by God, then at least by the Devil.</p><p>What ever disunites man from God, also disunites man from man.</p><p>But I always think that the best way to know God is to love many things.</p><p>Start living now.

For example, the Sabbath day according to the Ten Commandments is Saturday, not Sunday. And the reason is because God rested, not because Jesus was resurrected.</p><p>The best way to obtain truth and wisdom is not to ask from books, but to go to God in prayer, and obtain divine teaching.</p><p>God is one, but he has innumerable forms. He is the creator of all and He himself takes the human form.</p><p>White... is not a mere absence of colour it is a shining and affirmative thing, as fierce as red, as definite as black...

When you have been given something in a moment of grace, it is sacrilegious to be greedy.</p><p>I believe in something.
