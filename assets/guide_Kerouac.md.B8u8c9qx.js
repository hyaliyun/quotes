There are many kinds of good people, many kinds of mad people, many kinds of colorful people, many kinds of playboys, and many kinds of people who are more beautiful than you think.

The whole dark space was different at night, except for the noise of our valley, which was like the ground, and there was only silence and wind. The other side of the space was nothing but a big slope. The vast country road stretched to the steamer, and it seemed to be low and straight, and it was like the desert of the United States and the desert of Judea; we, the crazy and crazy Americans, got drunk and rushed into the black vast space in many corners. We are now on the rooftops of America, and we can really make a small voice to unite with others. I think we can only shout - in the dark, there is no big thing outside, and we can only shout. The white hair of the Gospel may be coming to us at any time. Let us shut up.</p><p>---035---</p><p>In my heart, all positive people are crazy.

When we are in a low position, we must keep our mind free.</p><p>---038---</p><p>上百个肮髒可再下的拾荒者在成串的沉船与鏽钢堆间劳作，其要之为发走分显小第，沉重用向上充也声悲剧色彩，第打然中可以转移消解把利只那种孤寂——人要之道可不是冷霓虹灯下面你的家，不是你孤独时可以得觉背部靠在上面的象利自之家，把利只那些冷霓虹灯利只柔象利自发出光芒，走物把好像这时仍他出是夏上他一般，随著冬上他的到来，把利只那堵红砖墙既污浊开要阴湿，格开现在灯光射在墙上，第打然中去主比看砖墙本你吃心的潮湿与刺寒消对也殆尽。</p><p>---039---</p><p>There were fishermen on the bushy riverbank, and dark red horn-shaped tents for resting. The mighty river was like a python, circling the river and rushing up and down, making an indescribable rumble. My face was so small, and the sleepy river, along with the buzzing bees and the simple huts, seemed to be washed away one day. The sun was setting, the beetles were jumping, and the mighty river was groaning.</p><p>---040---</p><p>Damn it, you listen to yourself, we must admit that everything is fine outside, there is no need to worry about it, we should realize that we should not be wronged by it, and we should not feel troubled by it, no matter how important it is to us.</p><p>---041---</p><p>All my life I like to compare with animals. I feel that the outside world is interesting. In my heart, all positive people are crazy. They love life, love to talk about it, don&#39;t show off, hope to have everything, they are never tired, never say things that are extraordinary, they are like wonderful red fireworks that keep erupting fireballs and sparks, and in the starry sky like a spider web that drags them far away, and the central point of blue light explodes again and again, and people exclaim &quot;Ah!&quot;</p><p>---042---</p><p>The son went to the Lord than live again under the use of him, the benefit of the day with your morning as a badge.</p><p>---043---</p><p>Our shepherds also claimed it. I am determined to wait until spring comes and the elephants recover naturally and then claim this distant war.</p><p>---044---</p><p>What I want to live like is to wear leather sandals and a thin linen robe, with a shaved head, on a hot afternoon, riding a bicycle with a group of monk brothers, and going everywhere. I want to live in a white temple with flying eaves, drink beer, and talk nonsense, and when I go to Yokohama, a humming Asian port, I will dream and work with my eyes.</p><p>I promised myself that when I started a brand new life, &quot;I will go with a backpack, travel all over the world, climb all the deserts, and find a clear and pure road.&quot;</p><p>---045---</p><p>You go and see me sitting next to you, but I&#39;m not that happy nor that lonely, and my journey is taking too long.</p><p>---046---</p><p>You and I are not the kind of people who are willing to trample on others just to live a comfortable life.</p><p>---047---</p><p>Try to meditate on various points, one is to be more focused than before, one is to look at the things under your feet, but it will not be so focused just looking at the moon, and you will gradually fall into a state of confusion.</p><p>---048---</p><p>&quot;In my heart, all the normal people are crazy. They love life, love to talk about it, don&#39;t show off, hope to have everything, they are never tired, never say anything ordinary, and use the wonderful red fireworks to make them feel like they are constantly erupting fireballs.&quot;</p><p>---049---</p><p>I huddled in the cold wind and rain, watching the sounds and emotions of the sad vineyard. My ears echoed with the song &quot;Lovers&quot; sung by Hugo Hodgson; there was my own music in the bushes. &quot;When we meet next time, you will wipe away all my tears, hug me and kiss me, whisper sweet words in my ears, ah, we have been together so much, lovers, ah, where are you...&quot; The lyrics of this song are not prominent, but the heart-wrenching melody and the singing are so beautiful, as if a woman is stroking her lover&#39;s hair under the soft light. The wind is roaring. I feel cold.</p><p>---050---</p><p>When we live, we speak eloquently and save ourselves.</p><p>---051---</p><p>In the same way, the purest moon in our perception will become like the moon in our eyes. It will sound like it is so pure, better than what it is, and we will use the method of perception in our hearts.</p><p>---052---</p><p>You realize that everything is as if it were predetermined and was meant to be for you at that moment.</p><p>---053---</p><p>&quot;I hope you will obey the Lord and think of the good things that you have done. When you get home, you will be happy and beautiful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I saw so many things on the road, but they all stopped immediately.&quot;</p><p>---054---</p><p>I am a young writer, I have to start from there. I can still go on and on, I know there will always be women, there will always be illusions, there will always be everything; I can still go on and on, the pearl will always be handed to me.</p><p>---055---</p><p>When I woke up, the sun was red; it was one of the strangest moments in my life: I didn&#39;t know who I was anymore - I was away from home, tired from the journey, and staying in a hotel room I had never seen before. I heard the hiss of steam in the ground, the creaking of the old hotel wood, the footsteps on the stairs, and all kinds of sad noises, and saw the cracking ceiling, and for the first five seconds I didn&#39;t know who I was. I didn&#39;t panic; I just felt like someone else, a stranger, living a ghostly life. I was in the middle of crossing America, a difference between my youth and my future, and maybe that was the reason why that strange red afternoon happened.</p><p>---056---</p><p>Dean and Carlo Sink had met that night, and their meeting was a remarkable encounter. They were both smart, and as soon as they greeted each other, they had a liking for each other. It was one of their sharp eyes that saw through the other&#39;s two sharp eyes - one was a liar with a bright and holy heart, and the other was a liar with a dark and poetic heart, and that was Carlo Sink.</p><p>---057---</p><p>Ah, beautiful, warm night, feeling the light is really small, hug your girl, drink, talk, spit, just go to the world. Our souls are more and more integrated, more and more inseparable.</p><p>---058---</p><p>One afternoon in the morning, Americans like to drink in a crowded pub; the young men like to meet each other; they just drink and chat about everything, while the people like to argue about the same things; everything seems to be fine.</p><p>---059---</p><p>You don&#39;t think other people&#39;s understandings as the nuts and bolts in that you are yourself of great account and proud as a king inside.</p><p>---060---</p><p>For those who regard death as a real life, the only punishment is walking away.</p><p>---061---</p><p>【Moon and Walking Objects】</p><p>This truth law has no more reality than the world.</p><p>The moon is like a moving object, it is more powerful than our eyes.</p><p>---062---</p><p>太阳下眼对多了，我坐在河不外破旧的码头上，望自走物新泽会也声主上空的长上他，心利只那琢磨自走物把利只那片一国道绵延到会也声主海岸的、广袤的原打然土象利自，把利只那远打然都声立完都声立了的多种，一切人和下十有梦想的人们。我知道这时候在衣阿华州允许地会子哭喊的象利自之家，一定有地会子哭喊，我也知道今夜可以看到许多星星……除了衰再下用再下于以地会地，谁也不知道谁的遭遇。这时候我想起了迪安.莫利只那亚蒂，我甚后好想起了我们永立象都声立有找到的再下用再下于迪安.莫利只那亚蒂。我月以想迪安.莫利只那亚蒂。</p><p>---063---</p><p>For the first five seconds I didn&#39;t know who I was. I wasn&#39;t scared; I just felt like I was someone else, a stranger, trapped in my life, living like a ghost.</p><p>---064---</p><p>Emptiness is emptiness, this is the saddest sound I know of.</p><p>---065---</p><p>Okay, now everything can start to detail and this creature will be born on the moon.</p><p>---066---</p><p>I felt like a crazy tramp and a crazy boss...

Five brothers sang sweet Spanish songs. Stars hung on the roof; smoke billowed from the stove chimney. I smelled the aroma of pounded beans and peppers. I murmured in my head. The five brothers sang in falsetto. It was not loud enough to see the sound of the song.</p><p>---069---</p><p>Shi Qulizhi doesn&#39;t care about the basic principles of all people and things in nature...
