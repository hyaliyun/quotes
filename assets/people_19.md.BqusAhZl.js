god a belief held at the time by his own parents and their family church he was unable to convince the leadership of his family church that they misunderstood what the bible states about homosexuality and this led to both himself and other family members leaving that churchin march 2012 vines delivered a speech in front of a congregation at college hill united methodist church detailing his controversial belief that the bible never directly addresses and certainly does not condemn loving committed samesex relationships the presentation was recorded on video and uploaded to youtube where it went viral through its sharing on social networks the clip was noted for its detailed treatment of the bible verses that are generally translated to refer to homosexuality and for the claim that once original languages and context are taken into consideration some bible references are more ambiguous than many people realize some scholars pointed out that the material of the video was largely not new but the format made the formerly fringe material more accessible to the general public since then the video of the speech has been seen more than 700000 times on youtube and has been featured in the new york timeshis video drew various responses from christian media outlets and individuals often contesting his claim that the god of the bible condones homosexual relationships conservative samesex attracted christians also offered critiques for example of his use of old testament verses in light of the new covenant robert gagnon widely recognized as one of the worlds top experts on the subject claimed that he has previously refuted the arguments that vines raised some of the secular media reports about the video drew criticism themselves for example for their journalistic quality requests for public debates with vines have tended to be declined or ignored however supportive articles and groups have contributed to his causevines success in gaining an audience as a vlogger gave him impetus to found the reformation project a nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the mainstream christian churchs teachings on sexual orientation and gender identity and seeking greater inclusion of lgbt lay members and clergy in april 2014 vines published a book god and the gay christian which provided a backdrop of his speech and responds to the main themes of the controversy like the video the book has been celebrated by lgbt christians while many of its claims have been generally repudiated by conservative christians in the same week the book was published the faculty of southern baptist theological seminary released an ebook god and the gay christian responding to matthew vines edited by albert mohler mohler argues that vines severs the passages under discussion from the flow of the biblical narrative and the bibles most fundamental revelation about what it means to be human both male and female while there have been many who have previously claimed that homosexual relations are not sinful some have claimed that what sets vines apart is that he speaks from a conservative christian perspective vines himself positions himself this way claiming that he holds a high view of scripture however many conservative christians dispute this claiming that he does not in fact hold a high view of scripture"},{"author":"Janika Sillamaa","quote":"janika sillamaa

a lot of my work one has to decide whether one is the controlling agent or being controlled and to decided what are the pros and cons of both situations nemiroff p 47the surprising variety of

the 200m at the 2006 african championships in athletics where he finished in fifth place that same year he participated at the 2006 commonwealth games where he reached the quarter final in the 200m race and achieving a new personal best of 2099 in 2007 coiffic became the second athlete after stephan buckland to win the 100m the 200m and 4x100m relay events at the indian ocean island games also

eliminated in the first rounds of the 4x100m relay with the retirement of stephan buckland in july 2010 coiffic was thought to be the sprinter who would put mauritian back at the international level but has disappointed many mauritians due to his poor performances at the 2010 african championships in athletics and the 2010 commonwealth gameshowever in 2011 coiffic impressed many with his winning streak of three gold medals at the 2011 indian ocean island games held in mahe seychelles at these games coiffic easily won the 100m in 1059 the 200m in 2119 and the 4x100m relay in 4049 thus repeating his performance that he achieved four years ago in the 2007 games this makes him the only athlete in the history of the games to win all three events two times consecutively he thought of attempting to break the games record in the 200m which is 2046 and was achieved in 2003 by stephan buckland but that seemed to be too farfetched as he would have had to run close to his personal best

constitution in mind he spoke as a creator of the art when he was alive what he said was law in death are his words are no longer validit is here that he explains the background behind general chois reason for choosing chang ung as successorthat was why general choi handpicked mr russell maclellan as the senior vicepresident to fulfill the role as acting president if anything happened to general choi at this time mr chang ungs name was never mentioned our beloved founder still waited for his son to visit him at the hospital in pyongyang but his last hope totally vanished when the nine people visited gen choi without his sons presence in mid of june 2002 after the international gen chois cup in ottawa canadasince february 2002 there has been a recent rapid change in the political situation in both koreas after general choi was admitted to the hospital in north korea general choi saw the light of unification in both taekwondo and north and south koreas with mr chang ungs ioc experience knowledge and talents as well as his relationship with mr ung yong kim his various meetings with both north and south koreans taekwondo committees members general choi hong hi handpicked mr chang ung as his successor before his departure the sudden appearance of mr chang ung surprised much of the present core itf members as he was never spoken of by general choiour beloved founder general choi hong hi did not pick mr chang ung in favour of north korea but he picked him up as successor because of the present political climate as well as his leadership qualities this was the brilliant future vision of our beloved founder and father if you were mr chang ung i believe that regardless of whether you were a canadian italian korean or argentinian you would be picked too that is our general choi everything fits for taekwondo if it fits he would use it because he believed that these were gifts from heaven to him gen choi used to tell us that his parents gave his name choi hong hi and heaven gave his name taekwondo he was even afraid that nobody would know what taekwondo would be he asked people to cover his coffin with the words taekwondo i believe that whatever the outcome will
