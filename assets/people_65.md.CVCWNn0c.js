constructivist see social constructivism philosophy of mathematics ernests philosophical sources are the later works of ludwig wittgenstein and the fallibilism of imre lakatos this social constructivist philosophy claims that both the theorems and truths of mathematics and the objects of mathematics are cultural products created by humans furthermore the theorems and truths of mathematics always remain corrigible revisible and indeed fallible in principle at least this does not mean that mathematical knowledge is flawed or at risk however the claim is that the belief that mathematical knowledge is infallible cannot be demonstrated it is an article of faith even if the warrants for mathematical knowledge are the strongest warrants available to humankind for any knowledge claims ernest illustrates this position in his discussion of the issue of whether mathematics is discovered or invented his fullest exposition of the social constructivist position is given in the 1998 reference although an earlier version is given in the 1991 reference ernests version of social constructivism is controversial and has led to strong criticism the principal criticism is that mathematical theorems are truths and truths by their nature are infalliblein his account of social constructivism ernest links the worlds of research mathematics and that of school and college mathematics this link is achieved though the role of experts who as teachers communicate mathematical knowledge to learners and warrant their personal knowledge by means of testing and assessment as researchers experts both create new mathematical knowledge and warrant the productions of others through this linkage the personal knowledge of the experts is developed and itself warranted both explicit mathematical knowledge representations and personal mathematical knowledge circulate between the worlds of education and research which are not themselves wholly disjoint the personal knowledge cycle is mutually refreshing for both education and research a criticism of this account is that if mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and accepted it might be accepted purely on the basis of group agreement however ernest argues that mathematical knowledge communication creation and warranting take place in historical communities that respect traditions of mathematical practice with embedded and partly tacit criteria for acceptability such rules include accepted forms of presentation reasoning and consistency although these are historically contingent they are never arbitrary and in general conserve mathematical concepts theories and rules of acceptance furthermore the democratic rational and critical elements of mathematical thinking and mathematical communities mean that errors are eliminated a criticism of this position is that it conflates the social institution of mathematics with objective mathematical knowledgepaul ernest was born in new york city new york in 1944 to parents john ernest and elna ernest ne adlerbert however he has lived and worked in the uk since childhood apart from two years of teaching at the university of the west indies jamaica 198284 he is currently emeritus professor of the philosophy of mathematics education at exeter university uk originally a student of mathematics and philosophy up to phd level he became interested in

images on rice paper these images were also available in a series of postcard bookletsgreul was not a native himself and adopted the artistic style that he used from the first nations artists from british columbia in the pacific northwest some critics have labelled his artwork as inaccurate representations of northwest coast designs the different first nations groups had their own design styles forms color schemes etc and greuls designs are not a match to any of these styles greuls lack of authenticity as a first nations artist by birth and style has contributed to a somewhat negative view of his work by some members of the art community historically the first use of silk screening by a northwest coast native artist occurred in 1949 ellen neel a kwakwakawakw artist had her designs screened onto cloth scarves that rapidly became commercially successful soon thereafter greul began to market his silk screen designs on rice paper his designs sold well and were mass distributed through the hudsons bay company retail stores in the 1950s he was one of the first artists to see commercial success with the westcoast art style and can be credited with spurring many native artists to pursue the commercial aspect of their art it was in part in reaction to gruels works that some native artists decided to begin producing silk screened works of their own hoping to create a better

block coding published whilst working for att the first of these spacetime block codes from orthogonal designs established the theoretical basis for spacetime block codes and the second spacetime block coding for wireless communications performance results provided numerical analysis of the performance of the first such codes spacetime codes rely on the use of multiple antennas at the transmit side of a wireless link multiple copies of the same data are transmitted from these multiple antennas in such a way that the receiver has a much better chance of correctly detecting the signal in the presence of corruption and noise than if just one copy is sent the performance of spacetime coded systems in terms of the reliability of the transmission is significantly better than noncoded systems spacetime block codes in particular are known to be simple to implement and effective and jafarkhanis two papers triggered the massive international research effort into them that continues todaylater in 2001 jafarkhani introduced quasiorthogonal spacetime block codes which overcome some of the difficulties inherent in earlier codes at a cost of transmitting less data these too are now widely studied then in 2003 he introduced a more powerful version of his original codes the superorthogonal spacetime trellis codes which combine the effects of both block codes and spacetime trellis codes

known for her influential work in the philosophy of mathematics where she has worked on realism and naturalismmaddy received her phd from princeton university in 1979 her early work culminating in realism in mathematics defended kurt gdels position that mathematics is a true description of a mindindependent realm that we can access through our intuition however she suggested that some mathematical entities are in fact concrete unlike notably gdel who assumed all mathematical objects are abstract she suggested that sets can be causally efficacious and in fact share all the causal and spatiotemporal properties of their elements thus when i see the three cups on the table in front of me i also see the set as well she used contemporary work in cognitive science and psychology to support this position pointing out that just as at a certain age we begin to see objects rather than mere sense perceptions there is also a certain age at which we begin to see sets rather than just objectsin the 1990s she moved away from this position towards a position described in naturalism in mathematics her naturalist position like quines suggests that since science is our most successful project so far for knowing about the world philosophers should adopt the methods of science in their own discipline and especially when discussing science however rather than a unified picture of the sciences like quines she has a picture on which mathematics is separate this way mathematics is neither supported nor undermined by the needs and goals of science but is allowed to obey its own criteria this means that traditional metaphysical and epistemological concerns of the philosophy of mathematics are misplaced like wittgenstein she suggests that many of these puzzles arise merely because of the application of language outside its proper domain of significanceshe has been dedicated to understanding and explaining the methods that set theorists use in agreeing on axioms

world record of 9672 in the javelin throw eclipsing the global standard set by fellow countryman mikls nmeth at the 1976 summer olympics in montrealthis effort added more than two meters to the previous world record fueling discussion and speculation regarding the likelihood of alterations to the javelins design and flight characteristics proposed changes would finally take effect in 1986 following another two sizable improvements to the javelin world record the first coming in 1983 when tom petranoff then of the united states added precisely three meters to paragis mark and the other in 1984 when east german uwe hohn launched the 800 gram implement to 10480 meters hohns mark only came after the new design had already been officially proposed and contrary to a popular myth had nothing to do with the change indeed the primary reason for the change was to get rid of the then frequent flat or ambiguous landings which often made it hard to assess if a throw should be declared legal most famously in the highprofile case at the 1980 summer olympics in moscow where the eventual winner dainis kla only progressed to the last three rounds with an apparently flat throw ambiguous landings were also much more difficult to measure accurately compared to clearly legal ones where the javelin would stick in the ground at the landing spotparagi also competed at the moscow olympics even though his form had dipped a bit after another monster mark of 9620 on may 18 there could be no question he was among the leading favorites however the olympics were for him a major disappointment he had problems already in the qualification languishing more than five meters from a spot in the finals after two rounds with a substandard mark of 7260 but saved himself by throwing 8876 with his third and final attempt the best mark in the whole qualifying competition by almost three meters next day in the final however he could do no better than 7952 and had to be content with

an earlier suggestion by bohdan paczynski with eichler livio and schramm piran proposed that grbs originate from cosmological neutron star binary mergers a model that is generally accepted today during the early nineties when the cosmological vs galactic debate took place piran was one of the strongest and most vocal proponents of cosmological origin which was confirmed in 1997 with the discovery of cosmological redshifts from grbs aftergloweven before the cosmological origin of grbs was discovered piran laid the foundation to the generally accepted cosmic fireball model he suggested that grbs herald the formation of a newborn black holelater on together with reem sari and other collaborators piran further developed the theory of grb afterglows in a paper which has by now more than 1000 citations and of grb jets his review papersare the standard literature on this subject before working on grbs piran was among the founders of numerical relativity the numerical solution of einsteins equations in 1985 he wrote the first numerical code calculating the collapse and formation of a rotating black hole and the resulting gravitational radiation waveform this waveform shows relaxation towards the quasinormal modes of the black hole that forms detection of this waveform in the future by advanced gravitational radiation detectors might provide the ultimate proof of the existence of a black holein addition to these works pirans contributions range over a selection of problems in relativistic astrophysics he demonstrated the critical dependence of the stability of accretion disks on the cooling and heating mechanisms piran was the first to point out that inflation is a generic phenomenon involving any scalar field without requiring a specific potential and in particular that this is so for a free massive scalar field he went on later to show that in fact the onset of inflation is not fully generic and it requires specific initial conditions a concept whose full implications have not been addressed up to now he was the first to suggest and show that cosmic biasing depends on galaxy types and that different galaxies are distributed differently in the universe this is a concept that seems obvious today but was controversial when proposed in the late eighties pirans work includes also contributions to the general theory of relativity such as one of the strongest counter examples to the cosmic censorship hypothesis and the demonstration of the instability of the inner structure of a black holein addition to pirans work as an astrophysicist he has

test linux security and integrated the osstmm into other chaptersthere is very little written about him in terms of his work experience except what is written in interviewswithout admitting to the bad stuff lets say i started in physical security at age 16 i hung out with the store detectives where i worked by 18 i was kind of an authority at my university on identification fraud even working to teach local businesses on how to know a real id from a fake that summer i was hired to do beer stings to test store clerks to see how far i could push them to sell me beer illegally but stopped after a couple months because i never had the heart to fire those who failed i only gave stern warnings by my last year in university i worked in the computer lab battling disk viruses and breaking copy protection for professors who wanted to try unlicensed software at the same time i was paying for school by working sting jobs for a couple chains to catch embezzlement as well as point out other security lapses unfortunately i stepped away from security after college for a few years while chasing dreams and some bad ideas too although security was often part of my various jobs i didnt consider it as a profession until ibm germany tapped me to be on their ethical hacking team so i left my cushy softwaretesting job at intel to be a fulltime hacker the rest is all security after thatlater in an interview with learnsecurityonline he expands on the bad stuff he refers tomy experience begins with work in physical and human security doing undercover sting operations and cleanup work we also called it fire and hire but also hack and slash when there was a real mess which supported my want of that expensive computer equipment in the 90s but i always had a my own sense of fairness this frustrated my employers because i wouldnt always turn in the guilty if i thought they didnt deserve punishment for me it was always about what was fair and i still do not equate the law with justice so like most anyone who began their history in security with the start of the internet we were travelers and spelunkers across this new channel and only later called hackers or crackers when the few bad apples made the news but back then most of us were curious and not malicious personally i did no harm but then again i respect what other people have and their privacy they dont build
