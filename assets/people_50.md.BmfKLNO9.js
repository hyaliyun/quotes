the age of 32 aaron is married to ruth with two sons dean and adambenzeev received his ba in philosophy and economics 1975 and his ma in philosophy 1977 both from the university of haifa he was awarded his phd from the university of chicago 1981 his doctoral thesis was entitled perception as a cognitive system his doctoral studies advisor was stephen toulmin alan gewirth robert richards and william wimsatt served on the doctoral committee michael strauss his ma thesis advisor and stephen toulmin have greatly influenced his philosophical views their thinking is marked by a unique combination of a broad outlook on the very profound issues of philosophy and life a careful analysis of the details and the ability to concretize their discussion in everyday issues despite such similarity they came from different backgrounds while strauss like his grandfather martin buber was submersed in the german tradition and his important writings are in german and hebrew toulmin a pupil of ludwig wittgenstein grew up within the english analytic traditionthe philosophers whose writings have made the greatest impact upon benzeev are aristotle baruch spinoza and immanuel kant kants main influence is most evident in ben zeevs discussions on epistemology and perception aristotles and spinozas impact is more apparent in his discussions of the mindbody problem and in his work on the emotionsbenzeevs major books are the perceptual system peter lang 1993 the subtlety of emotions mit up 2000 love online emotions on the internet cambridge up 2004 in the name of love romantic ideology and its victims with ruhama goussinsky oxford up 2008 die logik der gefhle kritik der emotionalen intelligenz suhrkamp 2009benzeev has held several academic positions at the university of

chairperson of the association of university heads israel head of the university of haifa press and head of the academic channel he established the interdisciplinary center for the study of emotions at the university of haifa he is currently the president of the newly established european philosophical society for the study of emotionsphilosophical viewexplanatory toolsthe choice of conceptual tools determines the nature of our explanations in light of the complexity of psychological phenomena the tools that we use to explain them should be flexible enough to accommodate the complexity of reality three such tools which are evident throughout benzeevs writings are the distinctions between various levels of description prototypical and binary categories and intrinsically and extrinsically valuable activities the distinction between various levels of description reflects his stratification approach concerning the bodymind problem this approach has three basic assumptions a the mind consists of dispositional and actualized states and not of internal isolated entities b physiological and mental states are not actually separate but belong to two different levels of descriptionthe relationship between them is one of stratification rather than of causality and c mental and physical states emerge along a continuum that ranges from simple to more complex states this approach is close to aristotle spinoza and the advocates of the emergent view of mental properties this issue is discussed in detail in his book on perception benzeev further believes that prototypical categories which have no clearcut boundaries and no equal degree of membership are generally more appropriate to the psychological realm and hence clearcut definitions of emotions are of little value and general characterizations should be given preference furthermore we should expect many grey areas when discussing human activities benzeev emphasizes the importance of intrinsically valuable activities for longterm happiness and profound love the combination of all three distinctions is significant in explaining psychological and in particular emotional phenomena despite his use of complex conceptual tools on many issues benzeev remains close to a critical yet commonsense viewperceptionin his various writings on perception in particular the perceptual system benzeev rejects the indirect view of perception and argues for the presence of direct nonpure perception he rejects nave realism as well as extreme subjectivism and argues for a critical realism such realism considers perceptual qualities as properties of the perceptual environment which is a relational environment that presupposes the existence of a perceiver within the perceptual environment perception is direct as it involves direct awareness of events in the environment but in light of the relational nature of this environment perceptual awareness merely provides partial information about the worldthat part which is influenced by the subjects characteristics in his view perception is direct in two major senses it is perception of the objects themselves not of internal mental representations and it is not preceded by mediating inferential processes benzeevs book the perceptual system received an excellent review in the review of metaphysics with the reviewer jack ornstein stating that benzeevs view is the only remotely plausible approach to the mindbody problem finally we have a theory of perception and the mind which any scientificallyminded critical philosopher can live with together with his work on perception benzeev has pursued related issues in the philosophy of psychology such as the bodymind problem and memory and has written on various philosophers in particular aristotle and thomas reidemotionsfive years after finishing his phd thesis benzeev began to study the emotions a topic that remains at the center of his research today in this field he was particularly influenced by aristotle mainly his analysis of emotions as evaluative attitudes and by spinoza in particular his emphasis on the importance of change in generating emotions the psychological work that has most influenced his thinking has been the cognitive structure of emotions 1988 by ortony clore and collins benzeev has published many articles in this field as well as several books the subtlety of emotions mit 2000 love online emotions on the internet cambridge 2004 in the name of love romantic ideology and its victims oxford 2008 written with ruhama goussinsky and die logik der gefhle kritik der emotionalen intelligenz suhrkamp 2009the subtlety of emotions his major work on emotions is divided into two major parts the first presents an overall conceptual framework for understanding emotions and the second discusses individual emotions he considers emotion to be a general mode of the mental system and suggests that the typical cause of emotions is a perceived change the typical emotional concern is a comparative concern and the typical emotional object is a human being typical emotions are considered to have certain basic characteristicsinstability great intensity a partial perspective and relative brevityand four basic componentscognition evaluation motivation and feeling emotions are regarded as having a significant practical and moral valueromantic loveromantic love has been the major emotion discussed by benzeev in his book love online he demonstrates the value of his conceptual framework for understanding emotions on the internet and in particular romantic relationships in cyberspace no new emotion has been created on the internet but the generation of emotions is often differentfor example in the speed at which such emotions are generated he argues that the chaotic and dynamic nature of cyberspace will not replace the more stable nature of actualspace as we cannot live in complete chaos the test of the internet will be whether it can complement ordinary romantic activities just as the telephone complements ordinary social activities or whether it will merely replace them with less valuable activities as the television frequently doesthe book in the name of love is about our ideals of love as expressed in the romantic ideology our experiences of love and the disparity between the two this ideology which assumes that love is comprehensive uncompromising and unconditional may lead to extreme behavior such as is found in men who murder their wives or partners allegedly out of love although romantic ideology may have a negative impact on many people in different circumstances it still has the positive function of a guiding ideal at the basis of ben zeevs proposed nurturing approach lies the assumption that in order for romantic love to be maintained the lover should not merely ensure that the beloved feels good it is imperative too that the lover is profoundly satisfied with the way in which the relationship enhances her own development and flourishing only a profoundly satisfied person can enhance the flourishing of the other and of their togetherness in many current societies love is on the mind of an evergreater number of people and its presence is a major criterion for relationships love can no longer be dismissed as a silly fantasy it is perceived as realistic and feasible for an increasing number of peoplein recent years benzeevs research has been focused on romantic compromises and related issues such as the profundity of love the relationship between love and sex and love and time in romantic compromises people relinquish a romantic value such as romantic freedom or intense sexual desire in exchange for a nonromantic value like the wish to live comfortably he considers such compromises to be the most common and painful syndrome in intimate relationships nevertheless he argues for the existence of good romantic compromises where there is a value convergence between the two lovers and the lovers minds are at rest as their togetherness has an intrinsic value"},{"author":"David Dougherty","quote":"david brian dougherty is a new zealander

greater green triangle regional development associationat the 1997 election when liberal party member for mount gambier harold allison retired it was widely expected that mcewen would win the liberal preselection for the seat mcewen had also received positive writeups by the advertiser as an experienced political operative however in a major upset he lost to scott dixon a selfemployed sawmiller from mount gambier mcewen ran as an independent and just nosed out the labor candidate for second place on the final count a large flow of labor preferences allowed him to sneak ahead of dixon by 01 percent to win the seat the election saw him and two other conservative independents holding the balance of power in the newly elected house of assembly mcewen made a formal pledge to support the liberals on matters of confidence and supply allowing john olsen another term as premiermcewen was comfortably reelected in the 2002 election he was initially highly critical of peter lewiss support of a labor minority government under mike rann but later mcewen struck a deal of his own with labor when he accepted a specially created fourteenth cabinet post in november 2002 at various times being the minister for local government forests industry trade regional development small business agriculture and food and fisheries with a promise that he would retain a cabinet position after the 2006

candidate the move also prompted the sudden resignation of lechelle earl the writer of the articles and the papers chiefofstaff craig bildstien of the advertiser that everyone the advertiser spoke to suspects millionaire businessman allan scott is the chief financier of a local liberal campaign that has been flush with funds with widespread reports that the liberals spent 50000 on tv advertising between october and january the paper later reported that it had learned that labor candidate brad coates last week threatened to withdraw 6000 worth of advertising from the border watch because of concerns that the paper was too proliberal earlier in the campaign the border watch conducted a straw poll of 100 local voters presumably conducted at the mount gambier arms just before closing time which failed to get an answer out of 51 of them of the remainder 23 backed rory mcewen against 11 for labor and 10 for liberal the accompanying article drew attention to this intriguing insight from antony green there are reports the cfmeu is putting considerable effort into labors campaign in this seat this would be unlikely to elect a labor mp but it might be enough to defeat mcewen by squeezing his primary vote as suggested by the advertisers opinion poll given mike rann has promised that mcewen can stay in cabinet if labor is reelected there will be a few labor factional leaders who realise that one way of creating a cabinet vacancy is to defeat mcewen if there is a vigorous labor campaign in mount gambier it is more about internal labor politics in the formation of the next cabinet than realistic hopes of labor winning mount gambier 1there were fears of a voter backlash in the 2006 election due to mcewen siding with labor and he was presented with a strong challenge by liberal candidate peter gandolfi his primary vote dropped about 20 percent however he finished 17 percent ahead of the liberals on first preference and 62 percent on the twoparty vote although labor won a majority in its own right in this election mcewen kept his cabinet seat as promised2in 2007 the liberals placed the rann government under pressure over the nondisclosure of donations and gifts

the founder of gross national product comedy a comedy production company whose troupes have appeared on tv and radio in their own pbs comedy specials and stage shows in new york los angeles and have been called washington dcs comic monument and the capitals resident satirical gangjohn simmons son of a national security agency employee supposedly grew up amidst the spy community in washington dc during the cold war it was life as normal as far as he knew to live at remote electronic listening posts to pop in and out of washington every once in a while to attend a different school and make new friends every two years that didnt bother him at all it was fun and it helped me prepare for this wacky life stylehe attended the university of north carolina and then spent a year abroad at the university of kent in canterbury he studied theatre and history not theatre history he emphasizes then ended up dropping the theatre and graduating in history and journalism i like history more than anything i think that may be why i make fun of the news the kind of stupidity thats going on now has just been repeated through the centuries its nothing newthe idea of becoming involved in comedy goes bock to simmons very early years he never really wanted to do anything else i wanted to have a comedy group but it didnt seem right it didnt seem like it was attainable for some reason theres no career path for comedy is there you dont go to slapstick university comedy was a real fringe area when i was growing up standup comedy wasnt especially popular then and improv comedy today is still considered a stepchild to standupin 1980 following the year abroad he got a job as a reporter for cch commerce clearing house a really boring law publications company and formed gross national product under another name for excitement and fun i lived this kind of clark kent existence but it was a really great cover i could go in look at the wire service and if nothing was going on id just go home and go to bed it did give me access to press conferences at the white house and lots of government agencies but to translate what really goes on at that bureaucratic level is impossible its so inside the beltway that you cant really make fun of it so you go after whats in the news gnp was one of the first comedy group in washington dc there was no venue for comedy then we played in rock clubs they did a lot of revues performed in all the clubs in dc and baltimore md and developed a loyal following in 1982 while continuing in dc they started performing in clubs all over new york then simmons put gnp on hiatus for a twoyear interval 198486 when he came to los angeles to check it out his stay in la included engagements at the cast theatre the comedy store and as understudy to john roarke in the odysseys rap master ronnie obviously the satirical and political theme of his comedy continued regardless of location upon returning to washington dc he revived gnp with a new cast and their popularity resumed the original 80seat space eventually proved to be too small and in 1988 they moved to a larger 300seat venue at the bayou the largest night club in washington dc also in 1988 gnp inaugurated their scandal tours an irreverent bus tour of the notorious scandal spots in dcwhat might explain the transition from a patriotic nsaoriented young boy to someone who looks at the political and social world with such a cynical eye washingtonians are pretty cynical people its the political people and the people who work for them who are usually serious im the product of a very cynical age when i was in high school the watergate scandal was happening the people that i associated with were the sons and daughters of reporters and that ilk so we had a good time during watergate when you live in washington and see this parade of outoftowners every four years you make fun of them some of them are real dorks many of them are there because of politicalfavor appointments and they always roll in with this sense of greatness people in washington are up on whats happening and they want to make fun so we started to make fun of congress and the executive branch just as simmons grew up with watergate gnp grew up with president ronald reagan their favorite target for several years but we make fun of liberals too it depends on whos in power the ability to adapt to a constantly changing world keeps gnps revues up to the minute in content for example the la situation cannot be ignored right now right here the entire focus of a political debate has shifted were in the center

village of cortoon just outside tuam gilmore spent almost twenty years from 1968 onwards in the senior ranks of local cortoon shamrocks and helped the small rural club to county semi final appearances in 1975 and 1978 centre halfback is the position he will always be remembered for but he played in a variety of locations from full back to full forward actually pulling on the no 14 jersey to help his county to victory over roscommon in the 1981 national league decider a county minor in 1967 and on under 21 for two further years it was quite a magnificent achievement for the cortoon man to break into the countys star studded senior team at that timeany player who has suffered it will tell how bitterly disappointing it is to leave croke park emptyhanded on allireland final day gilmore was subjected to the painful ordeal on three occasions and not surprisingly would love the opportunity of venturing into the vaults of time and rewriting the record books failure to get his hands on an allireland souvenir was a bitter pill to swallow and by far the biggest regret of his career it was a big disappointment for me because its every players ambition to get one that would have been a great highlight for methe cortoon shamrocks star was resident centre half back on the galway sides which lost to offaly cork and dublin in 1971 73 and 74 respectively in hindsight he feels that had the tribesmen a trusty placekicker on board then things might have been different its a big disappointment to appear in three finals in four years and not win one to get so close makes it harder to accept but i firmly believe that the lack of a reliable freetaker cost us two finals the 71 result was upsetting because if we had put the ball over the bar from placed balls like tony mcteague did for offaly on the day then wed have won out comfortably a team must carry a freetaker who can get four out of five over the bar from within fifty yards a harsh lesson it was for the footballing tribesmen who certainly paid the price for missed opportunitiesdespite the obvious disappointments gilmores career furnished him with many golden memories memories to be treasured forever the galway centre half was honoured with allstar awards in 1972 and 73 appearing on allstar teams in the esteemed company of the likes of sean oneill kevin kilmurray brain mceniff mick oconnell and jimmy barry murphy to name but a few centre back was certainly the position i had the greatest love for and to win two allstars there gave me great personal satisfaction such awards are nice bonuses as was the national league medal but everything is only secondary to allireland championships he notes ruefully gilmore also appeared in four railway cup finals losing all four and could have been forgiven at times for questioning the gods and wondering whether he was jinxed naturally that thought does cross your mind at times he admits one will always remember the great micheal ohehir referring to the galway centre half back in the high scoring allireland of 1973 versus cork micheals words went like this tommy joe gilmore has it on his own half back line he goes past dinny long 60 yards out from the cork goals fifty yards out 40 30 on the 21 yard line and its over the baras the most memorable game he ever played in gilmore picks out the 311 to 27 victory over down in the 1971 allireland semi final that was a great down team and a day which stood out for me from a personal point of view i was pleased with my performance in the final but you have to look at the ones you win states gilmore who rates tigerish kevin kilmurray and selfless forager tony hanahoe as two of the best he ever came up against arriving on the intercounty scene just after the threeinarow had been completed the cortoon man could probably have timed things a little bit better when i arrived on the county team the likes of seamus leydon jim duggan and liam sammon were still there and it was a time during which galway football was very strong we were expecting to win more allirelands but unfortunately missed outliving in galway city at present gilmore has little active involvement with the national code but had a stint helping out willie joyce jimmy duggan tomas heavy and peter lee as a selector on the county team between 1986 and 88tommy joe gilmore didnt win an allireland medal but he deserved onealso

touched many hearts and this speaks loud and clear of the totally changed person he is now to what he was during the ethnic tension solomon islands needs enthusiastic leaders like mr lusibaea who are keen to learn and to carry out their official obligations to the best of their abilityon 30 november he was sentenced to two years and nine months in gaol for assault and grievous bodily harm as his sentence exceeded six months in gaol he lost his seat in parliament and thus his position in government he was released from gaol on parole on 14 january reportedly for good behaviour and for having undergone rehabilitation his early release caused an uproar among the opposition with acting leader of the opposition matthew wale requesting further explanation and suggesting that the government might have pressured the parole board into granting lusibaeas releaseon 20 january the minister for police james tora reduced lusibaeas sentence to one month using his discretion as minister under section 38 of the correctional service act consequently as it appeared lusibaea was no longer barred from occupying his seat he resumed his functions in parliament the opposition announced it would challenge the matter in court rodney kingmele president of the solomon islands bar association also criticised the decision lusibaeas ability to sit in parliament as a member of the government majority was viewed as crucial at a time when the government was struggling to maintain a viable majority in the face of defections it was initially unclear whether lusibaea was set to resume his post in cabinet but a listing of ministers in april 2011 still had the position of fisheries minister vacanton 17 october the high court ruled in the case brought by the opposition that the minister for police and the parole board had lacked the authority to reduce the sentence although they did have the authority to remit it they could reduce the execution of the sentence but that did not alter the fact that the sentence had indeed been passed a sentence could only be overturned by a court of appeal or by the monarchs use of her prerogative of mercy thus it remained the case that having been sentenced to two years and nine months in gaol lusibaea was barred from sitting in parliament the ruling came just as the prime minister had announced he intended for lusibaea to resume his functions as fisheries minister a decision rendered impossible by his renewed exclusion from parliamentdays after being excluded from parliament once more lusibaea donated si74700 to meet the tuition fees of
