easy to go for the easiest path to follow but they wont get you anything unique that only things thats going to make the song sound fresh and new is to set up a strange situation something that you feel a little uneasy with and go on that push it to its conclusion you may blow it all together on that route but then again you may wind up with something that will really turn peoples heads around and then theres the whole matter of spontaneity which is a particularly hard thing to get precisely because youre trying so hard to get it there are things that happen on first takes that youll never get again half of our hits are rehearsals lost there in most cases fine little things happen in songs when youre least expecting them you put one fine little thing up against another fine little thing make a marriage of the two and go look for some other fine little things you finally put all those things together and youve got something thats audible and distinctive and hooks you onto the song for

exceedingly high rate of alcohol consumption in the united states in the early nineteenth century at the time rorabaugh argued americans preferred cider and whiskey because those drinks contained more alcohol than beer which was too weak for american taste one can only conclude that at the root of the alcoholic republic was the fact that americans chose the most highly alcoholic beverages that they could obtain easily and cheaplyin his more recent work on the decade of the 1960s in american history rorabaugh has suggested a redefinition of the sixties in his 2002 book kennedy and the promise of

delivery of humanitarian and relief services to the people of south sudan while the function of the ministry for humanitarian affairs was for policy formulation and development when awut became minister she frustrated the work of the commission as she wanted to takeover the functions of the commission and that didnt sit well with peter as a result he wrote to the president of republic demanding that the minister be asked to function within the confines of the constitutional mandate instead of correcting the situation the president relieved him on 27 november 2013 since his relief from office the commission is no longer functioning as its work is usurped by the minister and the ministry and the new chairperson cannot risk his job by challenging awutbefore the outbreak of south

political flatform to convince voters to elect him peter was the first official to call on south sudanese leaders to stop the crisis before it happened but instead he was criticized by dr rieks supports like hon gatluak riek jaak and hon john chuol char saying that peter was not being truthful and that dr machar was not provoking any crisis in the country he was also criticized by nuer diaspora elements who are staunch supporters of dr riek machar but peter was vindicated on 15 december 2013 when war brokeout and members of the nuer community became victims of the crisis because they are from rieks ethnic group peter remained loyal to splm under the leadership of president salva kiir mayardit as a symbol of unity and national integrationpeter lam served as state minister of

which finally culminated in the establishment of the liaison office for the government of southern sudan in ottawa in 2008 in accordance with the provisions of the comprehensive peace agreementcpa and the interim constitution of southern sudan canada is known internationally for refusing to work with rebels a case signaled by their refusal to work with the former leader of splm dr john garang de mabior but those who know peter lam both know that he is a highly persuasive calm and skillful diplomat whose approach can hardly be rejected those qualities helped him succeed with canada peter was one of the key leaders of sudanese community in canada who defeated talisman energy of canada in fact in 2004 peter was said to have shut up an extremely arrogant dr jim buckee the former ceo of talisman energy who always insisted that bentiu never had people since independence of sudan a point which peter always took personally being a nuer himself and knows that bentiu has the largest nuer

submitted his resignation to the chairman of the splm on november 15 2008 stating that he was time pressed with his studies but those who monitored the situation in canada said that peter was humiliated when the liaison office for the government of southern sudan was appointed and left him and key splm leaders in canada out of the office he did not know how to explain this action to the splm leaders in canada who thought he had a role in the appointments at the same time he could not point fingers at the leaders in juba who actually did the appointments due to the political sensitivity of the issue the appointments made were seen by all southern sudanese in canada as tribally motivated but what is puzzling is that peter is known to detest tribalism and could not possibly be linked to those appointments resignation was an easy route for him to avoid being associated with those appointments but peter always denied those claims saying that he has completed the work he was asked to do he always says i have accomplished what was hard to do what has remained now is the day today management of the chapters and the nurturing of our bilateral diplomatic relations with
