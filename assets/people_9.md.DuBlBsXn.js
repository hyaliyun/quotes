he was born in talawi west sumatra indonesia he graduated in 1999 with a degree in fine arts from indonesian institute of the arts yogyakarta isi a school of national pride and the heart of progressive artmaking in indonesia creativity and change are the forefront of the schools agenda and this is evident in yunizars work ethic yunizars training reveals itself in his sophisticated expressive style articulated through a playful composition and subtle palette executed primarily in acrylic and pencil his works stand out in terms of texture colour brushwork and rhythm a restrained palette of cool colours yellows browns and greens is deliberately dirtied and smudged in his working and reworking of the canvas the result is a highly tactile work that entices the viewer to feel the

deeper theme to a casual observer his titles for his works may appear uninspired but upon delving deeper one will find that they often provide a hint of mystery to his portraits whilst adding an element of cynicism he is a painter whose works may be described by an attempt to advance his preoccupation for stilllife bottles pottedcactus apples and other elements are painted singly and later reproduced in simplified outlines eventually multiplying exponentially as minuscule elements on a vast canvas as crammed twodimensional landscapes choking on its own reproductive capacity at other times he obliterates this multiplicity displacing it with a single figure or a head unsmiling disfigured and consumed by a sense of estrangement or exile in a distinctive series coretan marks lines and markings are deployed as frantic utterance obfuscating and never declaring any form of intent however the sense of narrative is kept remaining in the fringes of the frame is eternally held in anxious tension one of indonesias most dynamic new artists yunizar draws from a rich heritage to create images that evoke memories of dreams and myths as well as the mundane"},{"author":"Kenny

about uplifting people i may not be able to change the world but i can lead people into thinking differently about life and living with each other also the lyrics in the song that tell about the
