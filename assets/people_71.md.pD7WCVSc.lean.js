relatively light 79 kg he played primarily for carltons vflaffiliate the northern bullants in his first two years and on his few selections in the carlton senior team received so little ground time that he did not have a disposal in his first three gamessimpson first broke into the senior team as a regular in the latter half of 2005 still eligible for the afl rising star in his third season on the list simpson was nominated in round 18 he played nine of the last 10 games of the season missing one game through injury and his pace and skill began to attract attentionsimpson took a big step up in the 2006 season being elevated to the leadership group and running 4th in the best and fairest he played every game mainly as a running linkman from halfback he finished in the top 5 in the afl for running bounces which was typical of his rebound play averaged 19 disposals with a maximum of 30 and eleven goals this style of running play prompted kevin sheedy to select simpson for the australian

one of those that made the discovery that autophagic degradation is a major effector of innate and possibly adaptive immunity mechanisms for direct elimination of intracellular microbes such as

cytoplasmic proteins such as il1beta and others these proteins normally reside in the cytosol but exert their functions extracellularly this work along with the work by others in yeast extends the influence sphere of autophagy from its canonical roles inside the cell and the confines of the intracellular space to the extracellular space affecting cellcell interactions inflammation tissue

musical director for youssou ndours super toile de dakar he is one of the most talented african bassists of the last quarter centuryhe has been playing the bass and producing music for super etoile since 1984 or earlier he is believed to have picked up the bass at age 13 but started his musical exploration at age 9 thanks to his older brother vieux mac faye who is an accomplished guitarist himself his other brothers are musicians as well lamine faye is one of senegals most popular and respected guitar players and for a long time was a member of super diamono before he left to form his own band lemzo diamono in 1991 adama faye who died in 2005 is regarded as one of the pioneers of keyboard playing in senegal he was one of the founding members of super diamono and also played keys for super etoile back in the 80s the faye brothers are in many ways very similar to the wooten brothers although they never formed a bandsuper etoile is one of africas best live bands and they have been traveling all over the world for nearly three decades in fact in november 2007 music critic robert christgau said on nprs all songs considered that he believed youssou ndours band is the worlds best live band habib faye cites the amnesty internationals human rights now world tour in 1988 as maybe his most rewarding time as a musician he says that it allowed him to grow as a bassist as he got to share the stage with music icons such as peter gabriel sting tracy chapman and bruce springsteen it is also in the middle of that tour that the album the lion in which peter gabriel participated was recorded gabriel would invite habib to join him on other records of his own later onin 1996 mickey hart hired him to play bass parts on his mystery box 1 album habib fayes resume also includes playing alongside a wide range of artists like manu katche mokhtar samba joe zawinul paco sery gilberto gil chet atkins mark knopfler branford marsalis poogie bell david sancious lionel loueke tania st val jacob devarieux david sanborn brazils carlinhos brown just to name a few he has produced albums for senegals topselling artists such as viviane ndour and kin lamin senegal he is regarded as a true genius as he has taken the bass to a completely new level in this west african nation he is one of bass players in senegal that brought the bass to the forefront and made it an instrument to be reckoned with the song bekoor from youssou ndours 1984 album badou is a reference for many senegalese bassists he has produced virtually every youssou ndour album since 1984 including the acclaimed 1994 the guide in addition to having years of gigging under his belt producing and touring with super toile he has been involved in many musical projects in senegal working with local artists the latest is abdou guit seck wocks former vocalist who is now pursuing a solo career his latest album is slated for release later this yearhabibs forte is his versatility he grew up in an environment where music had no boundaries his parents grew up dancing salsa and rock n roll he also grew up seeing his older brothers experimenting with jazz and blues sonorities he can virtually play any style from the rootsiest mbalax senegals predominant musical style to the grooviest funk not to mention afrobeat and jazz harmattan the first band he founded was one of the headlining acts at the 1998 edition of saintlouis international jazz festival senegal one of the most prominent jazz festivals in africain recent years habib has been focusing on the new afrojazz band he occasionally puts together habib faye quartet the lineup changes sometimes as far as his music philosophy is concerned he explains that he is not trying to compete with jazz musicians or do pure jazz but he tries to bring two different worlds together ie the richness of the african sound and the world of jazz he takes the blend of african music and jazz to a new level adding traditional african instruments such as kora sabar tama and lesserknown ones african music being very percussionoriented habib developed a technique where he can often be heard playing percussion parts on his bass that has the effect of making his sound far more rhythmic and distinctive his brand of mbalax that can be heard in most youssou ndour albums especially those released on the senegalese market puts percussive bass playing to the fore with that he gives more power to the aforementioned african traditional instruments his experiments culminated into the release of a live album only available in senegal special tribute to jaco pastorius live at central park dakar you can hear him on the album revisit some of jacos best known lines during his weather report years adding an african twist to ithabib fayes musicianship doesnt stop at the bass he is also an experienced keyboard player he can be heard playing keyboard bass on countless super toile tunes he is one of the finest keyboard bassists out there he pioneered marimba keyboard playing in senegalese music and it is the most popular style in senegal right now paradoxically he thinks that producers are now stuck with it and seem not to want to look further the lack of creativity on the part of some senegalese musical directors worries him particularly his work on guitar is no less important all of that is evidenced in youssou ndours live at union chapel dvd 2 released in 2003in 2006 habib flew to new york to work with angelique kidjo on her latest album djin djin 3 released on may 1 2007 kidjos website credits him as the senegalese bass giant djin djin

in physical chemistry in 1974 naqvi secured a csir junior research fellowship to carry out research at the national institute of oceanography nio goa he has since been working at nio in various capacities presently heading the institute naqvi is married to khamisa zarreen and has two children asad mehmood and sumbul zarreenearly in his research career naqvi was mentored by the late dr r sen gupta under whose guidance he obtained a phd degree from poona university in 1987 his research focussed on biologicallymediated chemical transformations in the oxygen minimum zone omz of the arabian sea which were largely unknown at that time he provided conclusive evidence for largescale denitrification microbial reduction of nitrate to n2 and n2o in the water column demarcated its spatial extent and determined its temporal variability quantifying denitrification using a variety of innovative techniques naqvi showed that the arabian sea is the worlds largest oceanic denitrification site accounting for at least onethird of the global water column denitrification his results revealed that in contrast with the eastern pacific zones of highest primary production and most intense denitrification are geographically separated in the northern indian ocean this decoupling was also shown to be reflected by respiration rates that were found to be maximal within the omz and also too high to be supported by organic matter supplied by particles sinking from the surface layer these results clearly point to additional modes of organic matter supply including in situ chemoautotrophic production within the omz the denitrifying layer was also demonstrated to contain maxima in bacterial abundance and turbidity naqvi and colleagues also generated the first comprehensive data set on natural abundance of isotopes in various dissolved nitrogen species from any oceanic area that provided new insights into marine nitrogen cycling further their work showed that contrary to the prevalent belief the arabian sea omz is ventilated surprisingly rapidly on time scales of a few years at most these results imply that the arabian sea is highly vulnerable to potential anthropogenic perturbationsas a part of the his pioneering efforts to investigate the impacts of global change on marine biogeochemistry of the northern indian ocean naqvi carried out extensive work on greenhouse gases carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 both in the openocean and seasonallyoccurring coastal hypoxic zone the coastal lowoxygen zone the largest of its kind in the world has been found to have intensified in recent years affecting living resources and providing feedback to global change the former is because denitrification removes all nitrate at rates that are the highest ever measured from any marine system culminating in sulphidic conditions and the latter is due to unprecedented accumulation of n2o thus it has been shown for the first time that human activities are causing an increase in oceanic emissions of n2o and the efflux of this potent greenhouse gas from the arabian sea is globally significant unlike those of co2 and ch4biological productivity in the ocean is sometimes limited by low concentration of iron this phenomenon widely prevalent in the southern ocean and equatorial pacific has been discovered for the first time in the western arabian sea significantly affecting regional biogeochemistry including the anomalous location of the omz it has been proposed that addition of iron to the hnlc waters could promote biological production causing a drawdown of atmospheric co2 consequently ocean iron fertilization oif has been widely regarded as a potential technique to sequester co2 from the atmosphere naqvi organized the largest oif experiment conducted so far called the lohafex in the southern ocean which yielded quite different results from those of previous studies in the absence of diatoms due to silicon deficiency in the study area intense grazing of smaller phytoplankton by zooplankton prevented large buildup of phytoplankton biomass and carbon export to the deep sea the lohafex findings imply a much lower than expected potential of oif for sequestration of atmospheric co2 naqvi initiated the first systematic study of freshwater ecosystems of india groundwaters natural lakes and manmade reservoirs observations in a large number of dams revealed relatively moderate eutrophication with anoxic conditions prevailing in the lypolimnia during summer stratification with an apparent loss of fixed nitrogen in most reservoirs mechanisms and rates of this loss have been determined more importantly it has been demonstrated that methane emissions from indian dams previously postulated to be the highest in the world are much smallernaqvi provided a nucleus for the formation of a biogeochemistry group in nio that over the years has developed to be among the best in the world in this process he also set up numerous stateoftheart analytical facilities and developed expertise many of which are not available anywhere in the country he guided and trained a large number of youngsters who are occupying high positions
