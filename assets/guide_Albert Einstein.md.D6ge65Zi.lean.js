A novice thinks he has thought of several steps, but an experienced player thinks they are just ordinary. A novice racks his brains, while an experienced player is flexible and free. This is true for playing chess and scientific research. If you want to know the reason, it is because the experienced players have a higher level of ability. Scientific insight is manifested in the ability to quickly grasp the essence through phenomena and quickly find the common causes or connections between seemingly different things. This is inseparable from the accumulation of knowledge and practice, and requires a higher level of observation, comprehensiveness and judgment. Without gradual change, there will be no qualitative change; without quantity, there will be no quality. Only by learning, accumulating and practicing more in daily life can we make high-level discoveries.</p><p>---189---</p><p>To punish me for my contempt for authority, fate turned me into an authority.</p><p>---190---</p><p>Although I have not been able to become a strict vegetarian due to external circumstances, I have always adhered to this principle.
