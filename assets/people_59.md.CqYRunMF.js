a primarily italian left communist organisation under the influence of amadeo bordiga which denounced the ussr as capitalist and aimed to rebuild a true leninism following the theses of the early italian communist party under bordigas leadership it refused all participation in the electoral system and generally considered democracy a perversion of class struggle and a means of oppression camatte left the icp in 1966 to protest against its activist turn and to defend the purity of revolutionary theory in his journal invarianceafter collecting and publishing a great amount of historical documents from left communist currents and analysing the most recently discovered writings of marx in the early 70s camatte abandoned the marxist perspective he decided instead that capitalism had succeeded in shaping humanity to its profit and that every kind of revolution was thus impossible that the working class was nothing more than an aspect of capital unable to supersede its situation that any future revolutionary movement would basically consist of a struggle between humanity and capital itself rather than between classes and that capital has become totalitarian in structure leaving nowhere and noone outside its domesticating influence this pessimism about revolutionary perspective is accompanied by the idea that we can leave the world and live closer to nature and stop harming children and distorting their naturally sane spiritthese views came to influence the anarchoprimitivists who developed aspects of camattes line of argument in the journal fifth estate in the late 1970s and early 1980s"},{"author":"Barry Hawkins","quote":"barry hawkins born 23 april 1979 is an english professional snooker player from ditton in kent he turned professional in 1996 but only

author best known for three books on time management a business coach until he retired on 24 november 2008 in the past he has also worked for the british army ministry of defence and the church of englandhis biggest selling book to date is do it tomorrow and other secrets of time management which challenges some traditional practices in time management with four simple tasks and seven principlesthe four tasks of his quick start guide are to assemble all delayed work into backlog folders where it cannot be seen collect all new work into related batches for the following day write down all things too urgent to wait until tomorrow before doing them and then start each day catching up on backlogged workthe seven principles are to have a clear vision do one thing at a time do small amounts of work often define realistic limits using closed lists of finite tasks that are not added to reduction of interruptions and clarifying solid commitments as opposed to vague interests together these form the foundation for what is the do it tomorrow dit time management systemforster compares time management choices to those made when ordering from a menu in a restaurant there is only a finite amount of food one can eat and a finite amount of time in a day so each choice has a logical opportunity cost the amount of work accomplished is a combination of creativity and efficiency and can only be increased by a improving efficiency b reducing the total number of tasks or c increasing available time prioritized task lists only postpone problems of efficiency which forster asserts are the major factor in time management by reducing busy work more time is made available for real work but many workers have an unrealistic sense of how much is possible improved efficiency alone cannot solve fundamental problems of worklife balance forster asserts that goals are as much about what we are not going to do as they are about what we are going to do proper attention to minor tasks prevents emergencies sameday or nextday responses are perfectly adequate in many cases and judicious use of closed lists increases efficiency regardless of the order in which finite tasks are completed strategic use of delay and closed lists is what forster calls the maana principle incoming tasks are thus scheduled forwardimportant nonroutine projects are identified as the current initiative for some action each and every day backlogs may be a current initiative until completed but the goal is to take breaks and complete a full days tasks each day with efficient focussince late 2008 mark has developed several variations of a new time management system called autofocus the system instructs the individual to simply write tasks sequentially in a notebook and then follow mechanical rules to go through the list choosing tasks to work on the process is designed to promote intuitive decision making and evaluation of what tasks to work

upon the comprehensive clinical expertise of childrens medical center of dallas and the internationally recognized scientific environment of ut southwestern medical centersince its founding cri researchers have developed an approach for mapping the environments within the bloodforming system that nurture the process of bloodcell formation in the process identifying a microenvironment in the bone marrow where bloodforming stem cells are maintained and another that fosters the specialized cells that produce infectionfighting t cells and b cells in the long run the research could increase the safety and effectiveness of bloodforming stem cell transplants such as those performed after healthy marrow is destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation treatments for childhood leukemia the findings also could have implications for treating illnesses associated with a loss of infectionfighting cells such as hiv and severe combined immunodeficiency better known as bubble boy disease cri also has developed an innovative model for predicting the progression of skin cancer in patients which may lead to new prognostic markers that can identify patients at the highest risk of disease progression as well as new therapiesin addition to the findings at cri morrisons laboratory has discovered a number of critical mechanisms that distinguish stem cell selfrenewal from the proliferation of restricted progenitors they have shown that stem cell selfrenewal is regulated by networks of protooncogenes and tumor suppressors and that the balance between protooncogenic and tumor suppressor signals changes with age this likely explains why the mutation spectrum changes with age in cancer patients as different mechanisms become competent to hyperactivate selfrenewal pathways in patients at different ages his laboratory has further shown that in some cancers many tumor cells are capable of driving disease growth and progression while other cancers are driven by minority subpopulations of cancer cells that adopt stem cell characteristics these insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of selfrenewal have suggested new approaches for promoting normal tissue regeneration and

school and played college football at palomar college unlike the soccer style approach which was becoming more and more widely used during his career dempseys kicking style was the standard of the day straighttoe styledempsey is most widely known for kicking a 63yard field goal as time expired to give the saints a 1917 win over the detroit lions on november 8 1970 at tulane stadium in new orleans prior to 1974 the goal posts in the nfl were on the goal lines instead of the end lines with time running out in the game the saints attempted a field goal with holder joe scarpati spotting at the saints own 37yard line the snap from jackie burkett was good and dempsey nailed the field goal with a couple of feet to spare the win was one of only two for the saints in that dismal seasonwith the kick dempsey broke bert rechichars nfl record for longest field goal by seven yards that record was equaled by jason elam in 1998 sebastian janikowski in 2011 and david akers in 2012 on december 8 2013 matt prater topped dempseys mark by hitting a 64yard field goal dempsey was born without toes on his right foot and no fingers on his right hand he wore a modified shoe with a flattened and enlarged toe surface this generated controversy about whether such a shoe gave a player an unfair advantage when reporters would ask him if he thought it was unfair he said unfair eh how bout you try kickin a 63 yard field goal to win it with 2 seconds left an yer wearin a square shoe oh yeah and no toes eitheradditionally when an analysis of his kick was carried out by espn sport science it was found that his modified shoe offered him no advantage the smaller contact area could in fact have increased the margin of errorin 1977 the nfl added a rule informally known as the tom dempsey rule that any shoe that is worn by a player with an artificial limb on his kicking leg must have a kicking surface that conforms to that of a normal kicking shoein 1983 dempsey was inducted into the
