competition ran by pttk and won every one of the available prizes some sort of a water canteen and a back pack that raised my spirits i realised that this made sensepreviously i would take part in kayaking and had my friend take photos not having a camera i observed and helped him at night in a makeshift darkroom in a bathroom and there we developed tiny copies when i saw them i thought to myself god these pictures are horrendous why did he take them in such a way thats when the image of what we had gone through together combined with the confrontation of the photographic effect embedded itself into my memory this is also why during the next kayaking trip i went down with a leica to face the challenge of this new and unknown issue i made it happen this was the trigger in my

singularities moved to the three given points differential equations with four or more singular points only infrequently have a solution which can be given explicitly as a series whose coefficients are known or have an explicit integral representation this partly explains why the classical hypergeometric function arises in many settings that seem to have nothing to do with each other the

laboratory in 1952 where he joined the project whirlwind staff there he was involved in the development of the memory test computer mtc a testbed for ferrite core memory that was to be used in

available for general use the only surviving computing system paradigm seen by mit students and faculty was that of a very large international business machine in a tightly sealed computation center
