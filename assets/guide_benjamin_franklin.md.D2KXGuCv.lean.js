The more of it one has the more one wants.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Anger is never without a reason, but seldom with a good one.&quot;</p><p>It is the working man who is the happy man. It is the idle man who is the miserable man.</p><p>&quot;By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion about the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it.&quot;</p><p>The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.</p><p>Wine is constant proof that God loves us and loves to see us happy.</p><p>Life&#39;s tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late.</p><p>Well done is better than well said.</p><p>Beware of little expenses. A small leak will sink a great ship.</p><p>&quot;In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.&quot;</p><p>Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.</p><p>&quot;Write injuries in dust, benefits in marble.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You may delay, but time will not.&quot;</p><p>Energy and persistence conquer all things.</p><p>&quot;Gain may be temporary and uncertain; but ever while you live, expense is constant and certain: and it is easier to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel.&quot;</p><p>Do not fear mistakes. You will know failure. Continue to reach out.</p><p>A life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things. There will be sleeping enough in the grave.</p><p>Time is money.</p><p>&quot;We are more thoroughly an enlightened people, with respect to our political interests, than perhaps any other under heaven. Every man among us reads, and is so easy in his circumstances as to have leisure for conversations of improvement and for acquiring information.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one&#39;s self.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If passion drives you, let reason hold the reins.&quot;</p><p>Never confuse motion with action.</p><p>Mine is better than ours.</p><p>Beauty and folly are old companions.</p><p>Content makes poor men rich; discontent makes rich men poor.</p><p>&quot;If all printers were determined not to print anything till they were sure it would offend nobody, there would be very little printed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When in doubt, don&#39;t.&quot;</p><p>He that would live in peace and at ease must not speak all he knows or all he sees.</p><p>Whatever is begun in anger ends in shame.</p><p>God helps those who help themselves.</p><p>Work as if you were to live a hundred years.

Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of.&quot;</p><p>One today is worth two tomorrows.</p><p>There never was a truly great man that was not at the same time truly virtuous.</p><p>Fatigue is the best pillow.</p><p>&quot;Laws too gentle are seldom obeyed; too severe, seldom executed.&quot;</p><p>Leisure is the time for doing something useful. This leisure the diligent person will obtain the lazy one never.</p><p>Savages we call them because their manners differ from ours.</p><p>&quot;I should have no objection to go over the same life from its beginning to the end: requesting only the advantage authors have, of correcting in a second edition the faults of the first.&quot;</p><p>It is easier to prevent bad habits than to break them.</p><p>&quot;When you&#39;re finished changing, you&#39;re finished.&quot;</p><p>Who is rich? He that rejoices in his portion.</p><p>&quot;He that raises a large family does, indeed, while he lives to observe them, stand a broader mark for sorrow; but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too.&quot;</p><p>Diligence is the mother of good luck.</p><p>&quot;Each year one vicious habit discarded, in time might make the worst of us good.&quot;</p><p>He that is of the opinion money will do everything may well be suspected of doing everything for money.</p><p>The doorstep to the temple of wisdom is a knowledge of our own ignorance.</p><p>&quot;To succeed, jump as quickly at opportunities as you do at conclusions.&quot;</p><p>There are two ways of being happy: We must either diminish our wants or augment our means - either may do - the result is the same and it is for each man to decide for himself and to do that which happens to be easier.</p><p>&quot;Being ignorant is not so much a shame, as being unwilling to learn.&quot;</p><p>Even peace may be purchased at too high a price.</p><p>He that can have patience can have what he will.</p><p>Hide not your talents. They for use were made. What&#39;s a sundial in the shade?</p><p>Honesty is the best policy.</p><p>&quot;If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be the greatest prodigality.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead, either write something worth reading or do things worth writing.&quot;</p><p>Rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God.</p><p>Some people die at 25 and aren&#39;t buried until 75.</p><p>Take time for all things: great haste makes great waste.</p><p>Wise men don&#39;t need advice. Fools won&#39;t take it.</p><p>&quot;In my youth, I traveled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer.&quot;</p><p>A good conscience is a continual Christmas.</p><p>&quot;Speak ill of no man, but speak all the good you know of everybody.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tomorrow, every Fault is to be amended; but that Tomorrow never comes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the &#39;Pilgrim&#39;s Progress,&#39; my first collection was of John Bunyan&#39;s works in separate little volumes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forced by the occasion.&quot;</p><p>A house is not a home unless it contains food and fire for the mind as well as the body.</p><p>&quot;As we must account for every idle word, so must we account for every idle silence.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Be slow in choosing a friend, slower in changing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.&quot;</p><p>To Follow by faith alone is to follow blindly.</p><p>&quot;Write your injuries in dust, your benefits in marble.&quot;</p><p>An egg today is better than a hen to-morrow.</p><p>&quot;Blessed is he that expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools, that don&#39;t have brains enough to be honest.&quot;</p><p>A penny saved is a penny earned.</p><p>&quot;Most people return small favors, acknowledge medium ones and repay greater ones - with ingratitude.&quot;</p><p>Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today.</p><p>&quot;There are three faithful friends - an old wife, an old dog, and ready money.&quot;</p><p>Rather go to bed with out dinner than to rise in debt.</p><p>&quot;The absent are never without fault, nor the present without excuse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If a man could have half of his wishes, he would double his troubles.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When men and woman die, as poets sung, his heart&#39;s the last part moves, her last, the tongue.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wars are not paid for in wartime, the bill comes later.&quot;</p><p>All who think cannot but see there is a sanction like that of religion which binds us in partnership in the serious work of the world.</p><p>&quot;So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for every thing one has a mind to do.&quot;</p><p>The doors of wisdom are never shut.</p><p>When will mankind be convinced and agree to settle their difficulties by arbitration?</p><p>&quot;Do good to your friends to keep them, to your enemies to win them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t fail the test, I just found 100 ways to do it wrong.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A great empire, like a great cake, is most easily diminished at the edges.&quot;</p><p>It is a grand mistake to think of being great without goodness and I pronounce it as certain that there was never a truly great man that was not at the same time truly virtuous.</p><p>&quot;Eat to please thyself, but dress to please others.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you desire many things, many things will seem few.&quot;</p><p>A countryman between two lawyers is like a fish between two cats.</p><p>A man wrapped up in himself makes a very small bundle.</p><p>&quot;All mankind is divided into three classes: those that are immovable, those that are movable, and those that move.&quot;</p><p>Half a truth is often a great lie.</p><p>&quot;I have no private interest in the reception of my inventions by the world, having never made, nor proposed to make, the least profit by any of them.&quot;</p><p>He that displays too often his wife and his wallet is in danger of having both of them borrowed.</p><p>&quot;It is the eye of other people that ruin us. If I were blind I would want, neither fine clothes, fine houses or fine furniture.&quot;</p><p>The strictest law sometimes becomes the severest injustice.</p><p>&quot;At twenty years of age the will reigns; at thirty, the wit; and at forty, the judgment.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Having been poor is no shame, but being ashamed of it, is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you would have a faithful servant, and one that you like, serve yourself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wealth is not his that has it, but his that enjoys it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where there&#39;s marriage without love, there will be love without marriage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Observe all men, thyself most.&quot;</p><p>He that has not got a wife is not yet a complete man.</p><p>Words may show a man&#39;s wit but actions his meaning.</p><p>&quot;Marriage is the most natural state of man, and... the state in which you will find solid happiness.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A place for everything, everything in its place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Be at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let every new year find you a better man.&quot;</p><p>Don&#39;t throw stones at your neighbors if your own windows are glass.</p><p>&quot;I wake up every morning at nine and grab for the morning paper. Then I look at the obituary page. If my name is not on it, I get up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Without freedom of thought, there can be no such thing as wisdom - and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech.&quot;</p><p>&quot;God grant that not only the love of liberty but a thorough knowledge of the rights of man may pervade all the nations of the earth, so that a philosopher may set his foot anywhere on its surface and say: &#39;This is my country.&#39;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Guests, like fish, begin to smell after three days.&quot;</p><p>A learned blockhead is a greater blockhead than an ignorant one.</p><p>He that lives upon hope will die fasting.</p><p>&quot;If a man empties his purse into his head, no one can take it from him.&quot;</p><p>It is much easier to suppress a first desire than to satisfy those that follow.</p><p>&quot;God works wonders now and then; Behold a lawyer, an honest man.&quot;</p><p>Distrust and caution are the parents of security.</p><p>&quot;You can bear your own faults, and why not a fault in your wife?&quot;</p><p>I conceive that the great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by false estimates they have made of the value of things.</p><p>&quot;Since thou are not sure of a minute, throw not away an hour.&quot;</p><p>He who falls in love with himself will have no rivals.</p><p>The first mistake in public business is the going into it.</p><p>Who is rich? He that is content. Who is that? Nobody.</p><p>&quot;For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged, by better information or fuller consideration, to change opinions, even on important subjects, which I once thought right but found to be otherwise.&quot;</p><p>Games lubricate the body and the mind.</p><p>Hunger is the best pickle.</p><p>It is only when the rich are sick that they fully feel the impotence of wealth.</p><p>The use of money is all the advantage there is in having it.</p><p>There is no kind of dishonesty into which otherwise good people more easily and frequently fall than that of defrauding the government.</p><p>Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.</p><p>The discontented man finds no easy chair.</p><p>&quot;I saw few die of hunger; of eating, a hundred thousand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In general, mankind, since the improvement of cookery, eats twice as much as nature requires.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Many a man thinks he is buying pleasure, when he is really selling himself to it.&quot;</p><p>She laughs at everything you say. Why? Because she has fine teeth.</p><p>The way to see by Faith is to shut the Eye of Reason.</p><p>&quot;He that speaks much, is much mistaken.&quot;</p><p>The eye of the master will do more work than both his hands.</p><p>&quot;And whether you&#39;re an honest man, or whether you&#39;re a thief, depends on whose solicitor has given me my brief.&quot;</p><p>Applause waits on success.</p><p>He does not possess wealth; it possesses him.</p><p>He that rises late must trot all day.</p><p>He that&#39;s secure is not safe.</p><p>&quot;Hear reason, or she&#39;ll make you feel her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow some.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In the affairs of this world, men are saved not by faith, but by the want of it.&quot;</p><p>Many foxes grow gray but few grow good.</p><p>Never take a wife till thou hast a house (and a fire) to put her in.</p><p>Nine men in ten are would be suicides.</p><p>Remember that credit is money.</p><p>The art of acting consists in keeping people from coughing.</p><p>Those have a short Lent who owe money to be paid at Easter.</p><p>Those that won&#39;t be counseled can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>&quot;Where sense is wanting, everything is wanting.&quot;</p><p>Who is wise?
