Although there is little hope in this situation, it will always exist as a symbol of human nature.</p><p>---003---</p><p>How we develop in the end does not depend on which of the four paths we choose to take, but on our inner heart.</p><p>---004---</p><p>One busy hour in a brilliant life is worth four decades of silent time.</p><p>---005---</p><p>Life is made up of sobs, sniffles and whimpers, of which sobs account for the vast majority.</p><p>---006---</p><p>When you are sad, everyone is sad with you; when you cry, no one will cry alone.</p><p>---007---</p><p>But this city is like a large piece of quicksand flowing under you, and a grain of sand is like a grain of wind that keeps sinking and floating. Today you can float on the surface, and tomorrow you will sink into the mud and filth.</p><p>---008---</p><p>At this time, a kind of spiritual emotion is like this, because life is composed of sobs, sobs and groans, and sobs account for the vast majority of them.</p><p>---009---</p><p>I thought that the dogwood was blooming in the cold winter, as if it were in full bloom.</p><p>---010---</p><p>When you love your art, there is nothing you cannot sacrifice.</p><p>---011---</p><p>The awakening is composed of sobs, sobs and other expressions, and sobs account for most of them.</p><p>---012---</p><p>life is made up of sobs,sniffles,and smiles,with sniffles predominating.</p><p>---013---</p><p>Restless, coming and going in a hurry, as unpredictable as time.</p><p>---014---</p><p>The child thought that the sound came from the larynx, and the larynx seemed to be covered with tongue coating.</p><p>---015---</p><p>The ocean is vast, and no matter how you expand it is like the sky. In the end, it will still be in vain in such a small place.</p><p>---016---</p><p>&quot;Be good to me, it&#39;s for your sake. My hair may be a little shaved,&quot; she went on, &quot;but no one can fail to know how much I love you.&quot; These wonderful combs, made of pure tortoiseshell, were naturally studded with precious jewels - the color just matched her beautiful hair.</p><p>---017---</p><p>When you are happy, people rejoice with you; when you cry, people will not care about you or cry with you.</p><p>---018---</p><p>But this city is like a huge quicksand flowing through the ground, with its grains of sand constantly moving. The grains of sand that are now on the surface will soon sink into the clay and mud.</p><p>---019---</p><p>How we develop as people has nothing to do with the path we take; the key lies in our nature.</p><p>---020---</p><p>The so-called awakening among humans is composed of four elements: crying, sobbing and tears, among which sobbing accounts for the vast majority.</p><p>---021---</p><p>We missed each other at the beginning, when someday our long life came to an end, maybe he was there, recalling my own romance with a little kid, the pale picture of a runaway marriage, the satin badge of my dream hidden in the safe drawer, an argument with a steam radiator, a quarrel for a lifetime.</p><p>---022---</p><p>I just started crying for a while, and gradually I realized in the crying that happiness and sadness, smile and crying are not born out of you, and these account for less of you. What&#39;s more, you pretend to be strong and can&#39;t bear it.</p><p>---023---</p><p>In the past, there might have been flowers and plants here. But if it hadn&#39;t been for this open world, those flowers and plants would have withered and died in the filthy and rotten air.</p><p>---024---</p><p>In this heart, I have already introduced you to the apartment suite. It is not surprising that the foolish man will be indifferent to the benefits. It is very unwise for you to sacrifice your most precious thing for the sake of underestimating the young. However, we have to say the most important thing to the wise people today. Of all those who give gifts, the one who runs away is the wisest. Of all those who receive gifts, the one who develops like you is also the wisest. After all, when you talk about the young people in your time, you are the wisest.</p><p>---025---</p><p>Following the bell, the door of the second house opened and I came to the door of the girl&#39;s room. I thought she was a nasty, oversatiated worm that had eaten all the meat and was left with only an empty shell, now looking for a new tenant to fill the space.</p><p>---026---</p><p>Others see the flowery image as something talented, but they underestimate you when you see the green door.</p><p>---027---</p><p>As we wandered about Duhu Lake, we gradually acquired the ability to get around without any difficulty. We should not underestimate the greatness of the world, but when we were trapped in that little house in the snow, we felt for the first time that if we had studied Dutch works, Greek, the division of labor and culture, and the deeper understanding of the world, we might have been able to get around easily after some meditation.</p><p>---028---</p><p>A poor couple, the husband has an old watch, but the husband also has a watch chain. The wife has beautiful hair, but the husband also has a comb. On Christmas Eve, the husband sold his old watch and bought a comb for his beloved wife. But the wife had already sold her beautiful hair, so she bought four watch chains for her husband. For love, each of them gave up the most precious thing - but the husband also found that it was worthless!</p><p>---029---</p><p>The wind was howling outside, the snow was trying to get through the cracks in the sky, and the cold was besieging the backs of the six victims.</p><p>---030---</p><p>When I love you, I am willing to make the greatest sacrifice.</p><p>---031---</p><p>Now the rug has been completely developed by that time, so much so that even the looms that originally made it are no longer available.</p><p>---032---</p><p>The city is like a huge quicksand beach, with the sand constantly moving. After four tunnels, you can see the sand on the top layer today, but tomorrow it will be buried in the bottom layer in the next few years.</p><p>---033---</p><p>Since the beginning of time, a woman&#39;s feelings towards another woman have never been so secretive and mysterious. A woman is like a wind, as fast as lightning, piercing the heart of another woman, sifting out the most cunning disguises in the sister&#39;s foreign language, seeing through the deepest hidden desires, plucking out the sophistry in the cunning talk of the sister like combing out the hair, and so I twisted the other person with thumb and index finger, and he was the master of the house, and his deep-rooted suspicion was blown away by the wind.</p><p>---034---</p><p>I just want to buy some pancakes that are fried in oil and sprinkled with some of the new honey that is now on the market in a big tin bucket. I will trade my baby and my saddle for a stack of these pancakes.</p><p>---035---</p><p>It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do.</p><p>---036---</p><p>No matter it is day or night, we are inseparable like the wind. What will happen if he is enlightened and sent under the moonlight?</p><p>---037---</p><p>A soul that is ready to die at any time is the loneliest and saddest in the world.</p><p>---038---</p><p>I’m tired of waiting.</p><p>I’m tired of thinking.</p><p>I want to turn loose my hold on everything, and go sailing down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.</p><p>---039---</p><p>No one sang &quot;Sweet Home&quot; in a fast tempo; no one put the door in a hatbox and took it with him when he went away; no one&#39;s grape vines were twined around the hat as decoration; no one knew that the fruit tree was just a rubber bonsai.</p><p>---040---</p><p>There may be statues of saints here, but it is not difficult to imagine that after years of walking on the ground, demons and monsters have already taken us down in the darkness and dragged us to the bottom of a certain cellar for a few months. We can no longer stay in this evil abyss.</p><p>---041---</p><p>&quot;I just can&#39;t understand why some men can eat breakfast like the wind and tame a wild horse, and can shave a young man like the wind in the dark, but when they see a girl in a flowery dress, they shrink their hands and feet, sweat all over their backs, and can&#39;t even speak for a moment.&quot;</p><p>---042---</p><p>When you are obsessed with your art, no sacrifice is too great to bear.</p><p>---043---</p><p>The amount of love you have is beyond measure.</p><p>---044---</p><p>This man, who was a genius in the windmill business, was so overwhelmed at this moment that it seemed as if the wind from outer space was blowing all the way down below him, and it seemed as if he had his own windmill that was spinning non-stop.</p><p>---045---</p><p>My fingers began to fly across the computer, and something began to jump around, like insects hovering over a summer stream.</p><p>---046---</p><p>Since then, her beautiful hair has been scattered on her body, a small waterfall of brown, undulating and shining. Her hair fell below her knees as if she had spread it out like a piece of clothing.</p><p>---047---</p><p>I was born with all the instinctive senses of a primitive man, but as I grew older, I used the little things in society to smooth out the edges of my personality and emotions.</p><p>---048---</p><p>I go to seek on many roads</p><p>What is to be</p><p>True heart and strong, with love to light</p><p>Will they not bear me in the fight If the wind is not enough to teach me, I will win this battle of life</p><p>To order, shun or wield or mould</p><p>My Destiny? My destiny?</p><p>---049---</p><p>If a person wants to take care of the funeral home business for the rest of his life, then all the treatment is meaningless to you.</p><p>---050---</p><p>Life is almost made up of crying, sobbing and whimpering, among which sobbing accounts for an absolute majority.</p><p>---051---</p><p>The truth is that the child has arrived, a cold, overgrown stranger (the doctors can&#39;t help him with pneumonia) wandering around in this special place, touching it with his cold fingers, and thinking of that country when he was a child.</p><p>---052---</p><p>Before the trial, I saw that this lawsuit, which was not serious at all, made me collapse. I was so scared that I thought I would be a jerk for many years. I felt that I would be embarrassed in the future and be trapped in prison. I ran to Hong Rushifeng and stopped him.</p><p>---053---</p><p>You said money can&#39;t buy time? Yes, in this place, you can also learn &quot;eternity&quot; and send it to your home. But I have seen the power of time on people. When I was young, I used her to bump into the ore and got scars all over.</p><p>---054---</p><p>When the truth came, the child knew the truth, a cruel one knew the truth, the child could not see the flesh, the doctor could not take care of the uninvited and &quot;pneumonia&quot; guest, who wanted to lurk around in the art district, touch this heart with his cold fingers and touch that heart with his hands.</p><p>---055---</p><p>People don&#39;t want to sleep, but would rather take care of the funeral home business. This state of mind makes the medical field helpless.</p><p>---056---</p><p>The rug on the stairs was so worn and threadbare that even the loom that had made it must have disliked it.</p><p>---057---</p><p>Although &quot;police&quot; and &quot;hymn&quot; are formally arranged in the title, they are not equal as the elements that control human survival choices. In the binary opposition between police and hymns, the state power represented by &quot;police&quot; always dominates and controls all things, and the spirit represented by &quot;hymns&quot; is unequal.</p><p>---058---</p><p>No one came to the wind and there was also the snake&#39;s look in the hall. No one&#39;s Eve was young, of course, and she didn&#39;t want to be part of this runaway, not to be tempted by the young woman around her, and it was more tempting to look down on you.</p><p>---059---</p><p>When you are unwilling to obey the big things in this situation, you are looked down upon, and you are not very determined to resist. For you, it is because you want to give up the ability to look down upon and your own instinct to fight against it. For people who are simple-minded, this instinct is not strong. At the same time, you need to rely on your own strong will to protect yourself at this time. People like you who are weak in character and tired of being alone just happen to have a weak will.</p><p>---060---</p><p>People who are happy tend to feel that time passes quickly.</p><p>---061---</p><p>Happiness comes from awareness, and most of it is based on economics.</p><p>---062---</p><p>When a person loves someone else, what can&#39;t he devote to his future?</p><p>---063---</p><p>If a person really loves art, he can devote everything to it.</p><p>---064---</p><p>Even ten dollars can&#39;t buy one minute of time. If you can get rich in the sky, you can live a hundred months.</p><p>---065---</p><p>It&#39;s like even four millionaires combined can&#39;t change the rules of society in the slightest.</p><p>---066---</p><p>The boy&#39;s eyes were like pale gooseberries, firmly set in a bloated, greasy, dull, gray face. He was panting, with a circle of fat around his neck that some senators had, and his turned-up collar could not be fashioned into a fashionable hairstyle.</p><p>---067---</p><p>When one loves one&#39;s Art no service seems too hard.</p><p>---068---</p><p>Xiaokan&#39;s eyes were filled with dreamy longings, as if she had never seen a bright child; her cheeks were like peach blossoms just blooming, and in her happy mood, there was a special sweet aftertaste.</p><p>---069---</p><p>The sumptuous meal that had just been eaten had generated too much heat. The meal had oysters as the starter, plum pudding as the dessert, and included roast turkey, roast potatoes, chicken salad, pumpkin pie and ice cream. At this point, the person, who was already too full to move, just stared at everything in front of him with a kind of disdainful laziness.</p>",144)]))}const m=t(i,[["render",s]]);export{w as __pageData,m as default};
