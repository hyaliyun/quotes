professor of english 197589raffel worked with yale press and harold bloom on a series of 14 annotated shakespeare plays in 2008 the modern library published his new translation of geoffrey chaucers the canterbury talesraffels main contribution to translation theory was the principle of syntactic tracking which he championed in a monograph published in 1994 according to this theory a good translation of a prose literary text should track the syntax of the original elementbyelement never joining sentences where the original separated them never splitting a long sentence never rearranging the order of ideas the accuracy of tracking is measured syntactically by counting punctuation marks the best translation will be the one which comes closest to the original in a statistical analysis of commas colons and full stops raffel claims that those translators who heed the syntax also make the best lexical choices so that tracking becomes a measure not only syntactic accuracy but of translating skills per se this principle has since been applied in scholarly studies of translations of classical and modern works"},{"author":"Theo Zurenuoc","quote":"theodore zibang

written in 1857 1860s 3rd edition of leaves of grass contained 136 poems the poet also began the program of grouping poems in thematic clusters he numbered stanzas to give them the appearance of biblical verse but later dropped the conceit he made no further reference to the project of coupling his poems to the 365 days of the year as if an american book of common prayer it was thought to be an early organizational plan that was subsequently abandoned in his development of the clusters that grouped his poems in the various succeeding editions of leaves of grassgardner noted that there were two types of poems in whitmans collection the solo poems and those grouped in clusters these solo poems gardner called canticles after a 1889 reference by the poet in the essay a backward glance oer traveld roads these were major poems that could stand alone song of myself the sleepers etc the poems of the clusters and annexes were thematically related the only odd group in the whitman canon were the poems that were added to editions after the poets death by executor horace traubel old age echoes gardner simply ran the numbers he discovered that when the 25 canticles and the posthumous 13 old age echoes were subtracted from the canonical count of 402 the remainder was the suggestive total of 364 in the deathbed edition of 9192 whitman returned an earlier epigraph come said my soul to the title page with a facsimile his signature the poet concluded his life and work by signing off on the completion of an early design of a new biblethe main life workthe three hundred and sixtyfive

supplementary avowed as such leaving the book complete as i left it consecutive to the point i left off making always an unmistakable deep down unobliterable division line gardners compendium is minimally invasive to the poets overall scheme he added no additional poems to whitmans deathbed collection the order of the clusters and the poems within the clusters constitute over 93 of whitmans poems these remain exactly as the poet had decreed and are the basis of book ii the 25 solo poems are collected into a cluster of their ownbook i of whitmans code a new bible gardner compendium is predicated on the poets preoccupation with time i accept time absolutely the 52 cantos of song of myself and the 365 clustered poems mirror each otherthe singular walt whitman reflected in the multiples of the poets year the remaining 24 canticles suggest whitmans day i see something of god each hour of the 24 and duly the 24 hours appear in public each day each hour reflective of god and appearing in public each day as a final proof of the importance the 365 to the poets final tally of poems gardner discovered that his count of 365 was also replicated by whitman in his own presentation of his deathbed edition order if one simply considered the first cluster or inscriptions to be a preface each of the twentyfour inscriptions suggest the poets major themes and the concluding poem is addressed to the reader and concludes therefore to thee the following chants then the 365 count precisely follows without interruption from the first day of starting from paumanok
