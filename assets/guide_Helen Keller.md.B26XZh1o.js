I can remember the furry chicks, the blooming wildflowers, the kapok trees, the purple orchids in the river, the soft fibers and the plush cotton seeds, the rustling of the breeze through the cornfields, the rustling of the corn leaves colliding with each other, the sound of the flute we caught on the grass, its angry whine and the smell of green grass from its mouth, all of which are deeply imprinted in my mind.</p><p>---181---</p><p>In the pursuit of knowledge, one can only think more: &quot;I am working hard to acquire knowledge, and I hope that I can use it more and make a contribution to human society.

At that time, he tried his best to contact this university in the best way possible, but he was isolated in this university and could not come to the world at that time. Take me as an example.

I use my whole heart to experience everything in the university, and I can&#39;t stay idle for a moment. My life is full of the wind, like those small insects that live and die in a day, and I feel that they can squeeze their lives into one.</p><p>---204---</p><p>Many persons have the wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness.

Therefore, we can never think about the future, and waste most of our lives in regrets and waiting, and various desires can also take advantage of it. What worries me more is that only the deaf people should cherish hearing, and only the blind people should cherish hearing, and they can feel our value and happiness. For those who have lived a healthy life, they don&#39;t understand these things at all, and health becomes a negative factor. When you have something, you don&#39;t know how to cherish it. When it is gone, your family will regret it. This has been the case since ancient times.</p><p>---212---</p><p>And in this holy world, this different voice came out from the back of the child: &quot;Knowledge makes people love, knowledge makes people light, and wisdom makes people wisdom.&quot;</p><p>---213---</p><p>Of course, children in the classroom can make sounds when they are talking about things, but not all children after they grow up can make sounds when they are talking about things.

The university is beautiful, even the dark and silent. No matter what environment I am in, I keep working hard, and I feel that I can be satisfied with the university. Sometimes, when I sit alone and meditate, waiting for the door of life to close, a feeling of being isolated from the university is like a cold fog that surrounds me. There is light, music and friendship outside, but I can&#39;t go there. Fate and love have blocked the door. I want to protest this solemnly, but my heart is still full of enthusiasm. The sadness and growing pains of the past few years can only flow from my lips, but I can&#39;t say anything. It&#39;s like tears flowing down my stomach, and silence permeates my soul. He said to me, &quot;I hope I can come back to this day, and I will whisper to him, &quot;Forgetting myself is happiness.&quot; In fact, I have always regarded the light seen in your eyes as my sun, the music heard in your ears as my music, and the smile on your lips as my happiness.</p><p>---218---</p><p>I do not know how many readers of this text have seen and really appreciated the various kinds of animals in the zoo described by the author in this fascinating museum.
