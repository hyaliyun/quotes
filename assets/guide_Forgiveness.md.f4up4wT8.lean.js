The maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story who resolved not to go into the water till he had learned to swim.</p><p>Here&#39;s a nation, one of the founding pillars was freedom of speech and freedom of expression. And yet, we have imposed upon people restrictions on what they can say, on what they can think. And the media is the largest proponent of this, crucifying people who say things really quite innocently.</p><p>You can&#39;t separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.</p><p>The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom.</p><p>Freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be.</p><p>Freedom is fragile and must be protected.

This is the most radical detachment of all. But what is the self? The self is the principle of reason and responsibility in us. It is the root of freedom, it is what makes us men.</p><p>What is the essence of America? Finding and maintaining that perfect, delicate balance between freedom &#39;to&#39; and freedom &#39;from.&#39;</p><p>The precondition to freedom is security.</p><p>The best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.</p><p>I&#39;ve used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the United States as effectively as possible.

Today, I&#39;m so experienced in training - I&#39;m actually listening to my body now. My body needs freedom. When I train I create serenity and I produce oxygen in my blood. It helps me to think better and relax. By training, you accentuate the problem.</p><p>We don&#39;t appreciate what we have until it&#39;s gone. Freedom is like that. It&#39;s like air. When you have it, you don&#39;t notice it.</p><p>There should be a sympathy with freedom, a desire to give it scope, founded not upon visionary ideas, but upon the long experience of many generations within the shores of this happy isle, that in freedom you lay the firmest foundations both of loyalty and order.</p><p>A mere forty years ago, beach volleyball was just beginning.

Across the centuries, Passover has never lost its power to inspire the imagination of successive generations of Jews with its annually re-enacted drama of slavery and liberation.</p><p>Don&#39;t ever dare to take your college as a matter of course - because, like democracy and freedom, many people you&#39;ll never know have broken their hearts to get it for you.</p><p>The freedom to be an individual is the essence of America.</p><p>As a consequence of the victories we have registered during our first ten years of freedom, we have laid a firm foundation for the new advances we must and will make during the next decade.</p><p>I&#39;ve returned to being an amateur without any ties or strings attached, which gives me a freedom I never had before.</p><p>In many respects, the United States is a great country.

I really like the behind the scenes role, because all my freedom is there.</p><p>The general interest of the masses might take the place of the insight of genius if it were allowed freedom of action.</p><p>When we talk of freedom and opportunity for all nations, the mocking paradoxes in our own society become so clear they can no longer be ignored.</p><p>For you who no longer posses it, freedom is everything, for us who do, it is merely an illusion.</p><p>Negation is the mind&#39;s first freedom, yet a negative habit is fruitful only so long as we exert ourselves to overcome it, adapt it to our needs once acquired it can imprison us.</p><p>We chose more freedom instead of more government. We chose the principles of our founding to solve the challenges of our time. We chose a special man to lead us in a special time. We chose Mitt Romney to lead our nation.</p><p>I think there&#39;s some connection between absolute discipline and absolute freedom.</p><p>In 1960, when I came out of prison as an ex-convict, I had more freedom under parolee supervision than there&#39;s available... in America right now.</p><p>It is very easy to make clear what you want a film to say, but I did not wish to engage in overt propaganda, even for the right cause.

It is then we&#39;ll see the rising of the moon.</p><p>Not to sound overly cheesy but I really appreciate the freedom we have in America - especially as a female.</p><p>The political core of any movement for freedom in the society has to have the political imperative to protect free speech.</p><p>Among the best traitors Ireland has ever had, Mother Church ranks at the very top, a massive obstacle in the path to equality and freedom. She has been a force for conservatism... to ward off threats to her own security and influence.</p><p>It requires greater courage to preserve inner freedom, to move on in one&#39;s inward journey into new realms, than to stand defiantly for outer freedom. It is often easier to play the martyr, as it is to be rash in battle.</p><p>No people in history have ever survived who thought they could protect their freedom by making themselves inoffensive to their enemies.</p><p>We are living in the excesses of freedom. Just take a look at 42nd Street and Broadway.</p><p>Civilization is the order and freedom is promoting cultural activity.</p><p>Every therapeutic cure, and still more, any awkward attempt to show the patient the truth, tears him from the cradle of his freedom from responsibility and must therefore reckon with the most vehement resistance.</p><p>In health there is freedom. Health is the first of all liberties.</p><p>Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe, old age flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death.</p><p>Once I know people know who I am, it gives me a lot of licence and freedom to behave in ways I wouldn&#39;t normally.</p><p>But it wasn&#39;t until I graduated from Texas A &amp;amp M University and joined the United States Air Force, flying C-130&#39;s all around the globe, that I truly appreciated the blessings of freedom.</p><p>I&#39;m not a drug addict. My wild period wasn&#39;t about drugs it was about sexual freedom.</p><p>The State is the altar of political freedom and, like the religious altar, it is maintained for the purpose of human sacrifice.</p><p>As long as there is rape... there is not going to be any peace or justice or equality or freedom. You are not going to become what you want to become or who you want to become. You are not going to live in the world you want to live in.</p><p>There&#39;s a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling: you&#39;re self-propelled and decide exactly where to go. If you see something that catches your eye to the left, you can veer off there, which isn&#39;t so easy in a car, and you can&#39;t cover as much ground walking.</p><p>The magic of America is that we&#39;re a free and open society with a mixed population. Part of our security is our freedom.</p><p>The idea that men are created free and equal is both true and misleading: men are created different they lose their social freedom and their individual autonomy in seeking to become like each other.</p><p>It was so much fun to have the freedom to wander America, with no assignments. For 25 or 30 years I never had an assignment. These were all stories I wanted to do myself.</p><p>Freedom cannot be given... It can only be taken away.</p><p>I had spent many years pursuing excellence, because that is what classical music is all about... Now it was dedicated to freedom, and that was far more important.</p><p>There are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about God and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That&#39;s why the founding fathers built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves.</p><p>True freedom requires the rule of law and justice, and a judicial system in which the rights of some are not secured by the denial of rights to others.</p><p>But if people want to swim in the Thames, if they want to take their lives into their own hands, then they should be able to do so with all the freedom and exhilaration of our woad-painted ancestors.</p><p>We in the United States should be all the more thankful for the freedom and religious tolerance we enjoy. And we should always remember the lessons learned from the Holocaust, in hopes we stay vigilant against such inhumanity now and in the future.</p><p>A nice, easy place for freedom of speech to be eroded is comics, because comics are a natural target whenever an election comes up.</p><p>The current total of countries in the world with First Amendments is one. You have guaranteed freedom of speech. Other countries don&#39;t have that.</p><p>We know there is no such thing as freedom without the risk of failure.</p><p>Fortunately, somewhere between chance and mystery lies imagination, the only thing that protects our freedom, despite the fact that people keep trying to reduce it or kill it off altogether.</p><p>We need the children of Indonesia and the Philippines to manufacture our freedom of choice.</p><p>And we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves... when we have a government that honors our Constitution and stands up for the values that have made America, America: economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.</p><p>Hamas is a terrorist organization dedicated to annihilating the Jewish state.

We give a false portrayal of freedom. We&#39;re not free - if we were, we&#39;d allow people their freedom.</p><p>The clash of ideas is the sound of freedom.</p><p>A lot of people out there pay good lip service to the idea of personal freedom... right up to the point that someone tries to do something that they don&#39;t personally approve of.</p><p>The Ego is partly free. partly determined, and reaches fuller freedom by approaching the Individual who is most free: God.</p><p>Man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity, because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity.</p><p>True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power.</p><p>Hero-worship is strongest where there is least regard for human freedom.</p><p>America is just the country that how all the written guarantees in the world for freedom are no protection against tyranny and oppression of the worst kind. There the politician has come to be looked upon as the very scum of society.</p><p>What we have at present is a system of loss socialism. Whatever goes wrong is shouldered by the general public and anything that works is privatised. Worshippers of market freedom have suspended the most important economic principle: Risk and liability go hand in hand.</p><p>In the literal sense, there has been no relevant evolution since the trek from Africa. But there has been substantial progress towards higher standards of rights, justice and freedom - along with all too many illustrations of how remote is the goal of a decent society.</p><p>Political Freedom without economic equality is a pretense, a fraud, a lie and the workers want no lying.</p><p>What Churchill described as the twin marauders of war and tyranny have been almost entirely banished from our continent. Today, hundreds of millions dwell in freedom, from the Baltic to the Adriatic, from the Western Approaches to the Aegean.</p><p>Today, hundreds of millions dwell in freedom, from the Baltic to the Adriatic, from the Western Approaches to the Aegean.

It&#39;s freedom.</p><p>So sometimes the facts are good and sometimes the facts are bad, the important thing from the point of view of a principle as broad and important as freedom of speech is that the courts articulate and set forth in a very protective way what those principles are.</p><p>I love to deer hunt and fish and drive down the back roads in my truck. All those things basically equal freedom to me - and not having to return that message or call from my record company or management. At some point, I need to recharge.</p><p>Institutions - government, churches, industries, and the like - have properly no other function than to contribute to human freedom and in so far as they fail, on the whole, to perform this function, they are wrong and need reconstruction.</p><p>Freedom is such a gift.</p><p>It is not the simple statement of facts that ushers in freedom it is the constant repetition of them that has this liberating effect. Tolerance is the result not of enlightenment, but of boredom.</p><p>The American dream is about freedom.</p><p>Freedom is secured every day by our men and women in uniform. We must build a future worthy of their sacrifice.</p><p>The greatest enemy of individual freedom is the individual himself.</p><p>I try to give the media as many confusing images as I can to retain my freedom. What&#39;s real is for my children and the people I live with.</p><p>One of the rewards of success is freedom, the ability to do whatever you like.</p><p>Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons.</p><p>Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.</p><p>Freedom is the emancipation from the arbitrary rule of other men.</p><p>The freedom to criticize judges and other public officials is necessary to a vibrant democracy. The problem comes when healthy criticism is replaced with more destructive intimidation and sanctions.</p><p>I love the freedom of movement that my phone gives me.

I had a job when I was 10. I started living on my own when I was 17 or 18. I&#39;ve earned my own money I&#39;ve traveled the world. What would I rebel against?</p><p>I&#39;m a multidimensional person and that&#39;s the freedom of fashion: that you&#39;re able to reinvent yourself through how you dress and how you cut your hair or whatever.</p><p>No one who has lived even for a fleeting moment for something other than life in its conventional sense and has experienced the exaltation that this feeling produces can then renounce his new freedom so easily.</p><p>Remove advertising, disable a person or firm from proclaiming its wares and their merits, and the whole of society and of the economy is transformed. The enemies of advertising are the enemies of freedom.</p><p>Most men, after a little freedom, have preferred authority with the consoling assurances and the economy of effort it brings.</p><p>So the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund is out there preserving and fighting for, and sometimes winning and sometimes losing, the fight for First Amendment rights in comics and, more generally, for freedom of speech.</p><p>There&#39;s a glorious sense of freedom in comedy, just allowing myself to tell jokes, allowing myself to interrupt myself and tell old African folk stories that I made up - or didn&#39;t - and Jamaican stories.</p><p>The worst enemy of truth and freedom in our society is the compact majority.</p><p>The pillars of truth and the pillars of freedom - they are the pillars of society.</p><p>Our forefathers got it they got it, man. They took godly principles and they put them into action, and they developed our Constitution - the land of freedom where each man is accountable and responsible for his actions.</p><p>The First Amendment freedom of religion is as important today as when the Bill of Rights was first written.</p><p>One certain effect of war is to diminish freedom of expression.</p><p>Certain things happened in the early church. Women who had never had any freedom suddenly have the ability to stand up and speak and be treated as equals within the life of the church.</p><p>Their poverty secured their freedom, since our desires and our possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism.</p><p>The only thing money gives you is the freedom of not worrying about money.</p><p>When a truth is not given complete freedom, freedom is not complete.</p><p>Human beings want to be free and however long they may agree to stay locked up, to stay oppressed, there will come a time when they say &#39;That&#39;s it.&#39; Suddenly they find themselves doing something that they never would have thought they would be doing, simply because of the human instinct that makes them turn their face towards freedom.</p><p>We hold our heads high, despite the price we have paid, because freedom is priceless.</p><p>Freedom begins as we become conscious of it.</p><p>The problem of the world today is the people talk on and on about democracy, freedom, justice.

And if you&#39;re not willing to put your time where your mouth is, then I don&#39;t know quite what you mean by commitment in your life.</p><p>The United States and Israel have a unique relationship based on our mutual commitment to democracy, freedom, and peace. Therefore, just as our commitment to these principles must be steadfast, so must our support for Israel.</p><p>Bush is morally a universalist. For instance, he says the freedom is good, the same thing is good, all over the world. So in that sense he&#39;s a universalist.</p><p>Bush sees the evil as out there in the wider world, residing in people who &#39;hate freedom&#39;. Look at his immediate response to the pictures of prisoner abuse this is not what Americans do, these are not our values.</p><p>Freedom of conscience entails more dangers than authority and despotism.</p><p>I really feel that the talent I have is acting. Freedom and the possibility of play-that is what I like to have.</p><p>In the beginning, I loved being famous, but now I am tired of it and I would like to go back to my freedom.</p><p>The Bill of Rights was intended to secure freedom of speech - the freedom of speech of members of parliament to speak freely rather than be at threat of... the threat of an over powerful monarch at the time.</p><p>I will never understand people who think that the way to show their righteous opposition to sexual freedom is to write letters full of filthy words.</p><p>Well, the first thing is that truth and power for me form an antithesis, an antagonism, which will hardly ever be resolved.

That is a freedom.</p><p>For the past several years, I have remained what others would consider underground. I did this in order to build a community of people, like-minded in their desire for freedom and the right to pursue their goals and lives without being manipulated and controlled by a media protected military industrial complex with a completely different agenda.</p><p>As crucial as religion has been and is to the life of the nation, America&#39;s unifying force has never been a specific faith, but a commitment to freedom - not least freedom of conscience.</p><p>The spread of freedom is the best security for the free.</p><p>But there is a corollary to freedom and that&#39;s personal responsibility, and the real challenge is how you generate that personal responsibility without imposing it.</p><p>It is a strange fact that freedom and equality, the two basic ideas of democracy, are to some extent contradictory.

We thank Britain for introducing freedom and respect of human rights both in normal and demanding circumstances.</p><p>When the United States was founded, the very idea of a nation premised on democratic principles of freedom and tolerance was viewed by the vast majority of the world as an experiment doomed to fail. Dictatorships, monarchies, and theocracies had for many centuries ruled the world.</p><p>If you don&#39;t mind haunting the margins, I think there is more freedom there.</p><p>We know from our own history that democratic institutions take decades to mature, and we know from past conflicts that freedom is not free.</p><p>If it&#39;s total freedom, I guess the ultimate thing you can go into is total silence between the audience and performer, with the performer projecting something he doesn&#39;t even have to play.</p><p>We know the road to freedom has always been stalked by death.</p><p>Freedom from care and anxiety of mind is a blessing, which I apprehend such people enjoy in higher perfection than most others, and is of the utmost consequence.</p><p>We all have the right of freedom of speech under the First Amendment.

The freedom. You know, in my eyes this is the greatest country in the world.</p><p>We don&#39;t have an Official Secrets Act in the United States, as other countries do. Under the First Amendment, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of association are more important than protecting secrets.</p><p>Those who write the editorials and those who write the columns, they simply are unaccountable. They&#39;re free to impose their cultural politics in the name of freedom of the press.</p><p>I believe firmly that in making ethical decisions, man has the prerogative of true freedom of choice.</p><p>True freedom is the capacity for acting according to one&#39;s true character, to be altogether one&#39;s self, to be self-determined and not subject to outside coercion.</p><p>Now, do I think there has to be shared sacrifice among other nations in the world who want a stable and secure world? Absolutely, there has to be. But I don&#39;t think that America can ever abdicate its leadership role in the world because of who we are and where we&#39;ve come from. We are the symbol for the world for freedom and liberty.</p><p>It is true you cannot eat freedom and you cannot power machinery with democracy. But then neither can political prisoners turn on the light in the cells of a dictatorship.</p><p>One man&#39;s blasphemy doesn&#39;t override other people&#39;s free-speech rights, their freedom to publish, freedom of thought.</p><p>We must plan for freedom, and not only for security, if for no other reason than that only freedom can make security secure.</p><p>Because if you lived, as I did, several years under Nazi totalitarianism, and then 20 years in communist totalitarianism, you would certainly realize how precious freedom is, and how easy it is to lose your freedom.</p><p>If this liberal potential is properly channeled, we may expect the area of freedom of the United States to increase. The problem is to spend up our rate of social invention in the service of the welfare of all the people.</p><p>He who believes in freedom of the will has never loved and never hated.</p><p>Anything outside marriage seems like freedom and excitement.</p><p>There are forces all around you who wish to exploit division, rob you of your freedom, and tell you what to think. But young folks can rekindle the weary spirit of a slumbering nation.</p><p>I tasted freedom and I really liked it.</p><p>In the end, nature is inexorable: it has no reason to hurry and, sooner or later, it takes what belongs to it. Unconsciously and inflexibly obedient to its own laws, it doesn&#39;t know art, just as it doesn&#39;t know freedom, just as it doesn&#39;t know goodness.</p><p>Freedom is not won by merely overthrowing a tyrannical ruler or an oppressive regime. That is usually only the prelude to a new tyranny, a new oppression.</p><p>Freedom begins with what we teach our children. That is why Jews became a people whose passion is education, whose heroes are teachers and whose citadels are schools.</p><p>The message of Passover remains as powerful as ever. Freedom is won not on the battlefield but in the classroom and the home. Teach your children the history of freedom if you want them never to lose it.</p><p>What creates freedom? A revolution in the streets? Mass protest? Civil war? A change of government? The ousting of the old guard and its replacement by the new? History, more often than not, shows that hopes raised by such events are often dashed, sooner rather than later.</p><p>The financial reward is great and I love the life I have, but all money makes possible is for you to stop worrying about money. Then you have freedom to live your life.</p><p>When I was teaching in the 1960s in Boston, there was a great deal of hope in the air. Martin Luther King Jr. was alive, Malcolm X was alive great, great leaders were emerging from the southern freedom movement.</p><p>The American experience influenced my understanding of individuality, basic human rights, freedom of expression and the rights and responsibilities of citizens.</p><p>Take young researchers, put them together in virtual seclusion, give them an unprecedented degree of freedom and turn up the pressure by fostering competitiveness.</p><p>I learned what I really love is making films, not the film business. I want to be on the set, meeting with writers, I want that freedom. I love it now.</p><p>Never wear your best trousers when you go out to fight for freedom and truth.</p><p>You know, if you are kind of rich, the best thing is that you don&#39;t have to think about money. The best thing you can buy with money is freedom, time. I don&#39;t know how much I earn a year. I have no idea. I don&#39;t know how much I pay in taxes.</p><p>I think we recognize as Americans there are certain things that are just primary to the freedoms and liberties that we enjoy here and religious freedom is one of the most important things we as Americans cherish.</p><p>To us Americans much has been given of us much is required. With all our faults and mistakes, it is our strength in support of the freedom our forefathers loved which has saved mankind from subjection to totalitarian power.</p><p>All Americans value the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, and I believe this is essential for our continued way of life. But with this freedom comes responsibility. That responsibility has been abdicated here by some in the media and some in the government.</p><p>I&#39;ve never understood why people consider youth a time of freedom and joy. It&#39;s probably because they have forgotten their own.</p><p>I like the freedom of podcasting. With podcasting you can really mess around with the form and the format. You can do as much time as you like without having to pause for commercials.</p><p>I wanted to try to push some freedom into the men&#39;s clothes.</p><p>Religious tolerance is something we should all practice however, there have been more persecution and atrocities committed in the name of religion and religious freedom than anything else.</p><p>A free and truly independent press - fiercely independent when necessary - is the red beating heart of freedom and democracy.</p><p>After the tragedy, New Yorkers are more united than ever in their vision, as well as in appreciation what living in freedom means - and that if we stand together, we can accomplish anything.</p><p>Roosevelt talked not only about Freedom from Fear, but also Freedom from Want.</p><p>The greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom. But in the last analysis, our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m a libertarian conservative, so I believe in limited government/maximum individual freedom.</p><p>All the characters in my films are fighting these problems, needing freedom, trying to find a way to cut themselves loose, but failing to rid themselves of conscience, a sense of sin, the whole bag of tricks.</p><p>I don&#39;t think that artists of any kind would or could sacrifice their artistic freedom by being more responsible with their influence on people, especially young people.</p><p>If you can make people understand why freedom is so important through the arts, that would be a big help.</p><p>I remain optimistic. What we&#39;ve seen in Europe and the rest of the world is that freedom has a much stronger attraction than radical fundamentalism.</p><p>Criticism of government finds sanctuary in several portions of the 1st Amendment. It is part of the right of free speech. It embraces freedom of the press.</p><p>So far as discipline is concerned, freedom means not its absence but the use of higher and more rational forms as contrasted with those that are lower or less rational.</p><p>Every general increase of freedom is accompanied by some degeneracy, attributable to the same causes as the freedom.</p><p>Giving up even an ounce of precious freedom is a very serious thing to do.</p><p>But short films are not inferior, just different. I think the short gives a freedom to film-makers. What&#39;s appealing is that you don&#39;t have as much responsibility for storytelling and plot. They can be more like a portrait, or a poem.</p><p>They have the ability to take a person&#39;s freedom from them. On certain situations, they have the ability to take a person&#39;s reputation. And under certain circumstances, they have the authority to take a person&#39;s life.</p><p>When others stood idly by, you and your families gave your all, in defence of a risen people and in pursuit of Irish freedom and unity.</p><p>I feel like my honesty gives people the freedom to talk about things they wouldn&#39;t otherwise.</p><p>My view is that good community management is like having good municipal government: You should be able to have dissenting opinions and so on, freedom of speech, but your grandmother should also be able to walk down the street at night without having to worry about getting mugged.</p><p>I now bid farewell to the country of my birth - of my passions - of my death a country whose misfortunes have invoked my sympathies - whose factions I sought to quell - whose intelligence I prompted to a lofty aim - whose freedom has been my fatal dream.</p><p>Peace with the Palestinians will open ports of peace all around the Mediterranean. The duty of leaders is to pursue freedom ceaselessly, even in the face of hostility, in the face of doubt and disappointment. Just imagine what could be.</p><p>I call on the Iranian people: it is not too late to replace the corrupt regime and return to your glorious Persian heritage, a heritage of culture and values and not of bombs and missiles... How can a nation allow a regime to instill fear, take away the people&#39;s freedom and shock the young generation that seeks its way out of the dictatorial Iran.</p><p>The Middle East is ailing. The malady stems from pervasive violence, shortages of food, water and educational opportunities, discrimination against women and - the most virulent cause of all - the absence of freedom.</p><p>My heart goes out to the brave citizens of Syria, who each day risk and even sacrifice their lives to achieve freedom from a murderous regime. We in Israel welcome the historic struggle to forge democratic, peace-loving governments in our region.</p><p>Rosa Parks was the queen mother of a movement whose single act of heroism sparked the movement for freedom, justice and equality. Her greatest contribution is that she told us a regular person can make a difference.</p><p>We who officially value freedom of speech above life itself seem to have nothing to talk about but the weather.</p><p>Today is a celebration of hope for the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people can now take control of their government and their future by creating a society that protects the rights endowed to us by our creator - life, liberty and freedom.</p><p>Motorists who want to save money on gas will demand and buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. We should not limit their freedom with more government regulations.</p><p>More than anything else, let me be clear - we need to be willing to fight for freedom, and free markets, and traditional moral values. That&#39;s what the American people want to see this movement and this party return to.</p><p>I was intelligent enough to make up my own mind. I not only had freedom of choice, I had freedom of expression.</p><p>Personal technology has given us the freedom of being able to do whatever we want - and in the case of celebrities and athletes, whomever they want. But it can also serve as a humiliation jetpack.</p><p>The year most of my high school friends and I got our driver&#39;s permits, the coolest thing one could do was stand outside after school and twirl one&#39;s car keys like a lifeguard whistle. That jingling sound meant freedom and power.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe in firing professors. They have academic freedom.</p><p>We believe it wrong ever to take a dollar from a free citizen without a very necessary public purpose, because each such taking diminishes the freedom to spend that dollar as its owner would prefer.</p><p>I defend both the freedom of expression and society&#39;s right to counter it. I must pay the price for differing. It is the natural way of things.</p><p>Americans are free to choose everything from what they eat, drive and watch on TV to the President of the United States. Yet, when it comes to allowing Americans to choose the health insurance that works best for them and their family, the freedom to choose suddenly becomes un-American.</p><p>I think the American people have become more reliant upon government and less reliant upon themselves and that they now tend to put security ahead of freedom, but I think freedom is the most important aspect of our lives.</p><p>If they want to hang me, let them. And on the scaffold I will shout Freedom for the working class!</p><p>That&#39;s why I like fast film. It gives you more freedom to light more naturally.</p><p>Whatever the immediate gains and losses, the dangers to our safety arising from political suppression are always greater than the dangers to the safety resulting from political freedom. Suppression is always foolish. Freedom is always wise.</p><p>No, I don&#39;t believe in genius. I believe in freedom. I think anyone can do it. Anyone can be like Rembrandt.</p><p>Well, one thing, you got to stand in a courtroom and listen to a judge sentencing you to 25 years in prison before you realize that freedom of expression can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p>It would be too frightening for me to consider myself a role model. But I like the idea of not being afraid of letting your imagination rule you, to feel the freedom of expression, to let creativity be your overwhelming drive rather than other things.</p><p>I have the freedom to do what I want... bright people to talk to every day.</p><p>Even in the darkest regions, people have discovered their right of freedom.</p><p>The search for human freedom can never be complete without freedom for women.</p><p>If you scratch below the surface and ask what really makes me tick, it&#39;s the liberalism of trying to promote freedom and opportunity. Promoting social mobility is one of the keys to that.</p><p>I don&#39;t watch a huge amount of telly. I read a lot. I&#39;m reading at the moment &#39;Freedom,&#39; by Jonathan Franzen, a great big brick of a book, and I&#39;m loving it.</p><p>I am a passionate believer in freedom of speech. I would not support anything which would impinge on aggressive robust freedom of the British press, but when things go wrong and there has been outright illegality, there should be proper accountability.</p><p>I have more freedom when I write fiction, but my memoirs have had a much stronger impact on my readers. Somehow the &#39;message,&#39; even if I am not even aware that there is one, is conveyed better in this form.</p><p>As one gets older one sees many more paths that could be taken. Artists sense within their own work that kind of swelling of possibilities, which may seem a freedom or a confusion.</p><p>The arc of American history almost inevitably moves toward freedom. Whether it&#39;s Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation, the expansion of women&#39;s rights or, now, gay rights, I think there is an almost-inevitable march toward greater civil liberties.</p><p>I came out of the Soviet Union no longer a communist, because I believed in personal freedom.</p><p>As our federal government has grown too large and too powerful, the real loss has been the freedom of people to govern their own lives and participate fully in the American dream.</p><p>I loved the feeling of freedom in running, the fresh air, the feeling that the only person I&#39;m competing with is me.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t a woman who stayed tiny like I thought I would. I definitely gave myself the freedom to eat what I wanted.</p><p>I&#39;m privileged, because I have a lot of freedom. I want to use it to make as warm and normal a life as I can for our daughters.</p><p>I&#39;ve sold my soul for freedom. It&#39;s lonely but it&#39;s sweet.</p><p>So why am I facing a recall election? Simple: the big government union bosses from Washington want their money. They don&#39;t like the fact that I did something fundamentally pro-worker something that&#39;s truly about freedom.</p><p>They know the importance of their mission and of America&#39;s commitment to combating and defeating terrorism abroad, and they know that they are making a real difference in bringing freedom to a part of the world that has known only tyranny.</p><p>They have called Operation Iraqi Freedom a war of choice that isn&#39;t part of the real war on terror. Someone should tell that to al Qaeda.</p><p>The job of training an Iraqi police force is one of the most important tasks being undertaken in Operation Iraqi Freedom. It is also one of the most difficult.</p><p>I really care about this stuff, I care about movies, and you just have to be strong and don&#39;t be stupid freedom of choice is a big responsibility, and I&#39;m lucky enough not to have to just take any movie to pay the rent, so there&#39;s no need to be greedy.</p><p>As a 22-year Army Veteran who served in Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom, and as a Civilian Advisor to the Afghan Army in Operation Enduring Freedom, I understand both the gravity of giving the order, and the challenge of carrying it out.</p><p>I love the freedom that the narrative form provides.</p><p>Freedom is just Chaos, with better lighting.</p><p>Prosperity or egalitarianism - you have to choose. I favor freedom - you never achieve real equality anyway: you simply sacrifice prosperity for an illusion.</p><p>As a boy, I believed freedom for America meant freedom for me. There was a time I believed every word spoken.</p><p>Recruitment and retention are critical to sustain our Armed Forces with the best men and women willing to stand in the gap and make huge sacrifices to ensure our freedom.</p><p>I believe that being an actress or being involved in a movie has to be a life experience, otherwise why go for it? I have to change me, and I have to learn things, and I have to push me and my limits. By acting, I find a freedom inside of a prison in a way.</p><p>I believe in trying to get a balance between individual freedom on the one hand and social responsibility on the other.</p><p>Private property was the original source of freedom. It still is its main ballpark.</p><p>There&#39;s a freedom to being young that is harder to come by as time goes on.</p><p>I am known for a life spent in the struggle for freedom, and freedom includes the freedom of religion.</p><p>I suppose there&#39;s a melancholy tone at the back of the American mind, a sense of something lost. And it&#39;s the lost world of Thomas Jefferson. It is the lost sense of innocence that we could live with a very minimal state, with a vast sense of space in which to work out freedom.</p><p>I needed freedom to really express myself. That&#39;s really what Justified is about.</p><p>Not caring more about what other people think than what you think. That&#39;s freedom.</p><p>The freedom of all is essential to my freedom.</p><p>Freedom is not an ideal, it is not even a protection, if it means nothing more than freedom to stagnate, to live without dreams, to have no greater aim than a second car and another television set.</p><p>To realize that new world we must prefer the values of freedom and equality above all other values - above personal wealth, technical power and nationalism.</p><p>One of the things that bothers me most is the growing belief in the country that security is more important than freedom. It ain&#39;t.</p><p>I believe our flag is more than just cloth and ink. It is a universally recognized symbol that stands for liberty, and freedom. It is the history of our nation, and it&#39;s marked by the blood of those who died defending it.</p><p>A sense of freedom is something that, happily, comes with age and life experience.</p><p>In the last analysis, our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves.</p><p>You learn that you either are going to have a police state where you don&#39;t have any freedom left, or you&#39;re going to build a world that doesn&#39;t create terrorists - and that means a whole different way of &#39;getting along.&#39;</p><p>The people who are competing business-wise out there want what other successful labels and artists have. I don&#39;t want what they have I want my own path, my own sound, my own identity. Record labels care nothing about identity or artistic freedom, they want good business.</p><p>Just as the Security Council was largely irrelevant to the great struggle of the last half of the twentieth century - freedom against Communism - so too it is largely on the sidelines in our contemporary struggles against international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>I never abandoned either forms or freedom. I imagine that most of what could be called free verse is in my first book. I got through that fairly early.</p><p>The nice thing about the Bible is it doesn&#39;t give you too many facts. Two an a half lines and it tells you the whole story and that leaves you a great deal of freedom to elaborate on how it might have happened.</p><p>I feel like my work has been my path to freedom from having grown up in a segregated environment.</p><p>The American idea is as promising, imaginative, and full of the unexpected as the land itself. The land represents freedom - the frontier, the ability to make a new future with your own bare hands.</p><p>I loved climbing because of the freedom, and having time and space. I remember coming off Everest for the last time, thinking of Dad and wishing that he could have seen what I saw. He would have loved it.</p><p>You cannot mistake Bush&#39;s clarity of purpose. He believes in a story about freedom and opportunity that makes his followers feel like they aren&#39;t just ticking their days down but are part of something larger than themselves.</p><p>I don&#39;t look so closely at women&#39;s fashion, but from the 20th century on, people have had the freedom to express themselves and their individualities, and fashion is one of the most fundamental ways in which they do this, men and women are equally able to express themselves.</p><p>The people of the Middle East share the desire for freedom. We have an opportunity - and an obligation - to help them turn this desire into reality.</p><p>The U.S. has since the end of World War II had an answer - we stand for free peoples and free markets, we are willing to support and defend them - we will sustain a balance of power that favors freedom.</p><p>We are expected to believe that anyone who objects to the Department of Homeland Security or the USA Patriot Act is a terrorist, and that the only way to preserve our freedom is to hand it over to the government for safekeeping.</p><p>The freedom of each individual can only be the freedom of all.</p><p>Only the freedom of mind can prevent the state from becoming totalitarian and from issuing totalitarian demands.</p><p>It is for each of us freely to choose whom we shall serve, and find in that obedience our freedom.</p><p>Every dictator is an enemy of freedom, an opponent of law.</p><p>Thus, the struggle for peace includes the struggle for freedom and justice for the masses of all countries.</p><p>They call them terrorists, I call them freedom fighters.</p><p>What does it mean to be an American? While each of us may have our own specific answer to that question, we likely can agree on the basic principles of America: freedom, equal opportunity, and rights accompanied by responsibilities.</p><p>Wealth is a tool of freedom, but the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery.</p><p>Being big and famous doesn&#39;t get you more freedom, it gets you less.</p><p>Your determination, selflessness and courage have brought the freedom struggle towards its fulfilment.</p><p>So keep fightin&#39; for freedom and justice, beloveds, but don&#39;t you forget to have fun doin&#39; it. Lord, let your laughter ring forth. Be outrageous, ridicule the fraidy-cats, rejoice in all the oddities that freedom can produce.</p><p>Freedom of religion is a principle that is central to our Nation&#39;s Declaration of Independence. Congress has taken this positive step to protect our freedom to express allegiance to America&#39;s flag and the ideals it represents.</p><p>I wish we would all remember that being American is not just about the freedom we have it is about those who gave it to us.</p><p>If liberty has any meaning it means freedom to improve.</p><p>In America it&#39;s live by the sword of freedom of expression and be will to die by it as well.</p><p>That&#39;s free enterprise, friends: freedom to gamble, freedom to lose. And the great thing - the truly democratic thing about it - is that you don&#39;t even have to be a player to lose.</p><p>Native Americans are the original inhabitants of the land that now constitutes the United States. They have helped develop the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and separation of powers that form the foundation of the United States Government.</p><p>It is crucial that members of Congress cast votes that are supportive of the values upon which our nation was founded: equality, freedom, and opportunity for all people.</p><p>I&#39;ve never let producers tell me what to do. Even when I was making television, I always did what I wanted to do, and if I couldn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t do it. It was a freedom that, these days, young directors starting out don&#39;t have.</p><p>For us, holding on to religious rules, and following them, and refraining from what&#39;s forbidden, and being diligent with our duties, what do we call that? That&#39;s what we call freedom.</p><p>Private ownership of property is vital to both our freedom and our prosperity.</p><p>Liberty, freedom and democracy are very fuzzy words, but human rights is very specific.</p><p>Freedom and responsibility aren&#39;t interconnected things. They are the same thing.</p><p>The communitarians may say you&#39;ve been enjoying too much individual freedom, and that you must give up some of that for the benefit of the community. But they really mean that they want more power over your life - to force you to subsidize, obey and conform to their choices.</p><p>An open society is a society which allows its members the greatest possible degree of freedom in pursuing their interests compatible with the interests of others.</p><p>My philosophy is, don&#39;t take no for an answer and be willing to sacrifice your entire project for freedom.</p><p>Is Walt turning over in his grave? A man named Joe Roth runs Disney right now-he gave me the go-ahead and total freedom to do whatever I wanted to do.</p><p>None of us had any idea of how successful Downton was going to be. I thought I was signing up for another period drama that had a slightly modern feel. It had a freedom about it because it was coming out of the head of Julian Fellowes. Anything could happen and generally did.</p><p>Every American deserves to live in freedom, to have his or her privacy respected and a chance to go as far as their ability and effort will take them - regardless of race, gender, ethnicity or economic circumstances.</p><p>Responsibility and respect of others and their religious beliefs are also part of freedom.</p><p>If freedom&#39;s best friends cannot unify around a realistic, actionable program of fundamental change, one that attracts and persuades a broad majority of our fellow citizens, big change will not come.</p><p>The Vietnamese people deeply love independence, freedom and peace. But in the face of United States aggression they have risen up, united as one man.</p><p>Freedom&#39;s just another word for nothing left to lose.</p><p>Real freedom is creative, proactive, and will take me into new territories. I am not free if my freedom is predicated on reacting to my past.</p><p>There is only one cure for the evils which newly acquired freedom produces, and that cure is freedom.</p><p>I do believe that freedom isn&#39;t free - but today the corporate and political right wing is trying to cheapen this truly American value. They&#39;ve been cynically using the word &#39;freedom&#39; to rally the American public against its own best interests.</p><p>I say let&#39;s go back to a truer use of the word &#39;freedom.&#39; Let&#39;s start with President Franklin Roosevelt&#39;s Four Freedoms: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. I would add the freedom to bargain collectively. Those freedoms are under attack today.</p><p>People should have freedom in their pilgrimages and tours. They should come and visit historical monuments and sites - let&#39;s say the sites around Iran - where they can easily engage in wide- scale contacts with others.</p><p>When we are unwilling to draw clear moral lines between free societies and fear societies, when we are unwilling to call the former good and the latter evil, we will not be able to advance the cause of peace because peace cannot be disconnected from freedom.</p><p>That freedom that Picasso afforded himself, to be an artist in a huge number of ways, seems to be a huge psychological liberation.</p><p>Woman must have her freedom, the fundamental freedom of choosing whether or not she will be a mother and how many children she will have. Regardless of what man&#39;s attitude may be, that problem is hers - and before it can be his, it is hers alone.</p><p>The progress of freedom depends more upon the maintenance of peace, the spread of commerce, and the diffusion of education, than upon the labors of cabinets and foreign offices.</p><p>My parents came from Russia and suddenly they wound up in Boston, Massachusetts, Brookline, Massachusetts and they felt the sun rose and set on Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#39;s backside because he meant so much to them. This was freedom. This was something totally different from the Russia they had left.</p><p>Revolution! The people howls and cries, Freedom, that&#39;s what we&#39;re needing! We&#39;ve needed it for centuries, our arteries are bleeding. The stage is shaking, the audience rock. The whole thing is over by nine o&#39;clock.</p><p>Any existence deprived of freedom is a kind of death.</p><p>New ideas should confront old ideas. We must refer to the example of Europe. People have fought to make Europe what it is today. Freedom is not something that is served up on a plate.</p><p>The higher one climbs on the spiritual ladder, the more they will grant others their own freedom, and give less interference to another&#39;s state of consciousness.</p><p>Humanism: an exaltation of freedom, but one limited by our need to exercise it as an integral part of nature and society.</p><p>I definitely wanted to earn my freedom. But the primary motivation wasn&#39;t making money, but making an impact.</p><p>At 6 years old, the ice became a place for me to express myself. Because I was so shy off the ice, it became my safe haven, with music and freedom and self-expression. That was my emotional outlet.</p><p>The abortion license has not brought freedom and security to women. Rather, it has ushered in a new era of irresponsibility toward women and children, one that now begins before birth.</p><p>I suffered evils, but without allowing them to rob me of the freedom to expand.</p><p>But I do believe that a woman&#39;s truest place is in a home, with a husband and with children, and with large freedom, pecuniary freedom, personal freedom, and the right to vote.</p><p>Don&#39;t give me any money, don&#39;t give me any people, but give freedom, and I&#39;ll give you a movie that looks gigantic.</p><p>Widespread state control over art and culture has left no room for freedom of expression in the country. For more than 60 years, anyone with a dissenting opinion has been suppressed. Chinese art is merely a product: it avoids any meaningful engagement. There is no larger context. Its only purpose is to charm viewers with its ambiguity.</p><p>China has not established the rule of law and if there is a power above the law there is no social justice. Everybody can be subjected to harm. I&#39;m just a citizen: my life is equal in value to any other. But I&#39;m thankful that when I lost my freedom so many people shared feelings and put such touching effort into helping me.</p><p>The &#39;Bird&#39;s Nest&#39; National Stadium, which I helped to conceive, is designed to embody the Olympic spirit of &#39;fair competition.&#39; It tells people that freedom is possible but needs fairness, courage and strength.</p><p>Strong, generous, and confident, she has nobly served mankind. Beware how you trifle with your marvellous inheritance, this great land of ordered liberty, for if we stumble and fall freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin.</p><p>The freedom now desired by many is not freedom to do and dare but freedom from care and worry.</p><p>Patrick Henry did not say, &#39;Give me absolutely safety or give me death.&#39; America is supposed to be about freedom.</p><p>Now, then, in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom.</p><p>I spent a great deal of time with Che Guevara while I was in Havana.

Amazon takes away that freedom.</p><p>When I launched the development of the GNU system, I explicitly said the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers and have freedom, thus if you use some other free system instead but you have freedom, then it&#39;s a success.

Freedom can lead to instability, anarchy, and confusion. So there can be a moral counter-revolution.</p><p>With Napster and the sharing of music, of course, there are going to be people who exploit it. Greed has no end. But there&#39;s a lot of good that could happen. We shouldn&#39;t let the economic concerns of the major labels infringe on our freedom to share music.</p><p>I do have the freedom to choose what I want to do and I&#39;ll continue to do that.</p><p>Jazz is about freedom within discipline. Usually a dictatorship like in Russia and Germany will prevent jazz from being played because it just seemed to represent freedom, democracy and the United States.</p><p>Many people don&#39;t understand how disciplined you have to be to play jazz...

Those around the globe that value freedom must continue to persevere even in the darkest of times.</p><p>To her audience, Janis Joplin has remained a symbol, artifact and reminder of late Sixties youth culture. Her popularity never derived from her musical ability, but from her capacity to link her fantasies of freedom and immortality with ours.</p><p>The enemies of freedom will not prevail.</p><p>In short, is not liberty the freedom of every person to make full use of his faculties, so long as he does not harm other persons while doing so?</p><p>How can you be conservative and justify wiretapping people without a warrant? We&#39;re supposed to be the party of personal freedom and civil liberties.</p><p>Another hero was Tom Swift, in the books.

I hope that our cry for freedom may be heard.</p><p>In terms of filming, yes, it really does feel over now. There&#39;s a real sense of freedom now. It&#39;s a good time to finish, I think.

Stevenson;funny 26027;I wear black skinny-fit jeans - I can&#39;t get away from them. It&#39;s funny because I wore baggy jeans for ages, then one day my friend convinced me to try on a skinny pair and I thought they were great.;Shaun White;funny 26028;I never smoked. I never drank and I never took drugs. The funny thing is, nothing is more boring, people like this. For me, it&#39;s OK. But most of my friends, at least they smoke and drink.;Karl Lagerfeld;funny 26029;One time I went into a restroom and a girl followed me in. I signed an autograph for her in the sink. It was pretty funny because she was in a guy&#39;s restroom and she wasn&#39;t embarrassed at all.;Zac Efron;funny 26030;The follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family, their friends, people who should be supportive going, &#39;What are you talking about?&#39; Even just seemingly regular career paths, but if it&#39;s not what people expect for you they kind of react funny.;Joan Jett;funny 26031;A good artist is willing to die many times over.

The whole idea is to get people laughing and enjoying themselves, and I&#39;m a professional funny guy.;Chris Rock;funny 26034;It&#39;s funny. You succeed, but now where are you gonna go from there? I&#39;ve got to keep proving that I can laugh or cry more real each time.;Jeff Bridges;funny 26035;Do I have a long-term plan? Kind of. I have a general direction, I think. But it&#39;s funny what comes down the pike.;Jeff Bridges;funny 26036;The people I grew up around who I really liked were quick on the draw. It always just wowed me. And my mum would make weird funny comments. I can see in myself her self-deprecating, hippie humour. I can&#39;t take myself too seriously.;Drew Barrymore;funny 26037;If you tell the truth about how you&#39;re feeling, it becomes funny.;Larry David;funny 26038;I know what Germans are. They are a funny people. They are always choosing someone to lead them in a direction which they do not want to go.;Gertrude Stein;funny 26039;I was so afraid to even read a paper in front of my classmates.

In fact, the hallmark of life after junior high seemed to be the shedding of popularity as a central concern.;Susan Orlean;funny 26047;I mean I&#39;ve seen 3D films so far and I think it&#39;s a long way to go before they replace actors. It&#39;s a funny thing with 3D, I haven&#39;t quite got it yet. Yet.;Daniel Radcliffe;funny 26048;Funny things happen to you in movies for silly reasons.;Michael Caine;funny 26049;Chris Hemsworth is like Christopher Reeve in that he can do two things: he can wear a big red cape without a shred of self-consciousness. But he&#39;s also funny as hell, and he&#39;s so sweet. So with all the fish-out-of-water stuff, he&#39;s so funny. So he does almost two jobs in a way.;Tom Hiddleston;funny 26050;I like funny guys and those, for some reason, tend to be nerdy guys.;Megan Fox;funny 26051;The nightmare is you spend the rest of your life being funny at parties and then people say, &#39;Why didn&#39;t you do that when you were on television?</p><p>The funny thing about me that most people never really understand is that, at heart, I&#39;m really a jock.</p><p>I was a hop-around. I hung out with the rockabilly crew, the guys who were trying to be rappers, the funny kids.</p><p>I wanted to be that quirky girl who writes funny songs that still have meaning.</p><p>Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny. Maybe that&#39;s why I don&#39;t have a boyfriend.</p><p>I&#39;m a pretty funny guy, and I would love to do a comedy with a bunch of funny guys - movie-star guys, where they could help me through it.</p><p>You can&#39;t really be strong until you see a funny side to things.</p><p>It&#39;s only I have seen enough of it and the funny thing is now, I know that I&#39;m skinny, because I know there are even smaller clothes in the store. I think I&#39;m big, when I was big, I never thought about it.</p><p>I like reading Ball Tongue lyrics and all that stuff. And they published a book, and I wouldn&#39;t give my lyrics, and it&#39;s all wrong in the book, and I giggle. It&#39;s funny.</p><p>They say Yogi Berra is funny. Well, he has a lovely wife and family, a beautiful home, money in the bank, and he plays golf with millionaires. What&#39;s funny about that?</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m funny.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, but you get to a time in your life when you think you have all the friends you will ever have.</p><p>Books are funny little portable pieces of thought.</p><p>It&#39;s funny.

It&#39;s something you don&#39;t see dramatized, but almost every minority I know who&#39;s my age, they have these funny stories about their parents stereotyping other minorities.</p><p>Very often, I don&#39;t make it through moments of recording because it is genuinely funny and absolutely ridiculous that a 60-year-old grown man is making these noises.</p><p>I had the classic 40 meltdown. I did. It&#39;s embarrassing. It was pretty funny. But then I recovered. To me, it was like a second adolescence. Hormonally, my body was changing, my mind was changing, and so my relationship to myself and the world around me came to this assault of finiteness.</p><p>Life was a funny thing that happened to me on the way to the grave.</p><p>Don&#39;t remember me as too nice or beautiful or funny, because then you&#39;ll be disappointed.</p><p>I don&#39;t like comedy. I like funny things. I don&#39;t like comedy. Like, comedy movies are just, &#39;Oh Jesus.&#39;</p><p>The funny thing is I&#39;m not bothered or sad about being on my own - after all I&#39;ve never had a husband.</p><p>Light and funny has a more compelling quality when you&#39;re younger. But I haven&#39;t abandoned the genre: I love falling down I love Lucille Ball. It&#39;s just that a lot of those stories revolve around problems that I can&#39;t convincingly portray at this age.</p><p>I actually think of being funny as an odd turn of mind, like a mild disability, some weird way of looking at the world that you can&#39;t get rid of.</p><p>When I was a little kid, I wrote this play about all these characters living in a haunted house. There was a witch who lived there, and a mummy. When they were all hassling him, this guy who bought the house - I can&#39;t believe I remember this - he said to them, &#39;Who&#39;s paying the mortgage on this haunted house?&#39; I thought that was really funny.</p><p>Sometimes I think what I write is funny in its quiet way.</p><p>Actually I never did stand up. I&#39;m not that funny.</p><p>The funny thing is, the girls that I&#39;m always up against for roles are pretty nice and cool, like Emma Watson. She&#39;s awesome.</p><p>I love readings and my readers, but the din of voices of the audience gives me stage fright, and the din of voices inside whisper that I am a fraud, and that the jig is up. Surely someone will rise up from the audience and say out loud that not only am I not funny and helpful, but I&#39;m annoying, and a phony.</p><p>I&#39;ve thought for the last decade or so, the only actual place raw truth was seeping through in newspapers was on the Comics Pages. They were able to pull off intelligent social comment, pure truths not found elsewhere in the news pages, and had the ability to make it all funny, entertaining, and pertinent.</p><p>I have only been funny about seventy four per cent of the time. Yes I think that is right. Seventy-four per cent of the time.</p><p>No, no, I was only funny on stage, really. I, I, think I was funny as a person toward my classmates when I was very young. You know, when I was a child, up to about the age of 12.</p><p>Hemingway seems to be in a funny position. People nowadays can&#39;t identify with him closely as a member of their own generation, and he isn&#39;t yet historical.</p><p>I think the pattern of my essays is, A funny thing happened to me on my way through Finnegans Wake.</p><p>It&#39;s funny to be a critic.</p><p>I find it so funny that people find me so interesting.</p><p>Great, big, serious novels always get awards. If it&#39;s a battle between a great, big, serious novel and a funny novel, the funny novel is doomed.</p><p>We&#39;ve seen some insane signs: &#39;Is that a loaf of bread in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?&#39; Funny stuff along those lines. Very original. One just said, &#39;I will do unspeakable things.&#39; I thought that was very interesting - and mildly terrifying!</p><p>You know what&#39;s funny? I don&#39;t ever feel the need to escape. I have a strong marriage. I like my life. You hear about these guys having midlife crises - I don&#39;t see that happening to me.</p><p>I don&#39;t really get shaken very much. People could heckle me, a spotlight could go out, I could forget a lyric... I&#39;m not operating on somebody&#39;s brain, you know what I mean? So I just think it&#39;s all funny.</p><p>Without hurting anybody, we all tend to laugh at others&#39; discomfort. When someone slips on a banana skin and falls it&#39;s funny.</p><p>Always remember your kid&#39;s name. Always remember where you put your kid. Don&#39;t let your kid drive until their feet can reach the pedals. Use the right size diapers... for yourself. And, when in doubt, make funny faces.</p><p>I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn&#39;t want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn&#39;t have a choice. A talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work. It&#39;s funny because I&#39;d always known that I wanted a movie career. I just didn&#39;t think that I would be in the movies.</p><p>I&#39;m like, bursting. I should be working. I don&#39;t want to take a break. It&#39;s funny, on set, I don&#39;t have to go to the bathroom, I don&#39;t have anything wrong, I&#39;m perfectly fine, so through-and-through. I&#39;m not hungry. I&#39;m literally not even in my own body.</p><p>It&#39;s a funny thing: You want so badly for people to see what you do - you&#39;re proud of it - and I like the effect that movies have on people. But the attention can also make me uncomfortable.</p><p>And I like to keep whatever is mine remaining that way. It&#39;s a funny little game to play and it&#39;s a slippery slope. I always say to myself I&#39;m never going to give anything away because there&#39;s never any point or benefit for me.</p><p>It&#39;s not an accident that both my sister and I are writers. Our parents created an accidental Petri dish. My family has great storytellers, and I grew up in a very funny, conversational house and didn&#39;t have television. This small family farm was a bubble world that didn&#39;t have much to do with reality.</p><p>Come out&#39; is so funny to me because I&#39;ve never been in.;Adam Lambert;funny 26101;The word &#39;funny&#39; is a bit like the word &#39;love&#39; - we don&#39;t have enough words to describe the many varieties.;George Saunders;funny 26102;A romantic comedy has to be funny and make you think about life but the obstacle that has to be overcome is key.;Jennifer Lopez;funny 26103;There&#39;s something dangerous about what&#39;s funny. Jarring and disconcerting. There is a connection between funny and scary.;Christopher Walken;funny 26104;Some people can do things and get away with it. Comics are famously like that. Why is it that some guys can say the most horrible things and it&#39;s not offensive, it&#39;s funny?;Christopher Walken;funny 26105;I always like to watch comics and it&#39;s interesting that you can tell if someone&#39;s funny in 10 seconds.;Christopher Walken;funny 26106;I guess now that I think back, I used to play priest and be a funny priest. I don&#39;t know, I grew up in such a Catholic family that I kind of liked to test the boundaries a little bit and I think I had fun watching my mom laugh.;Jenny McCarthy;funny 26107;Comedy&#39;s so subjective, and if someone comes to watch, doesn&#39;t get it, doesn&#39;t find it funny, then fine.;Johnny Vegas;funny 26108;The funny thing is people won&#39;t let me pay for things. I&#39;ll be in a restaurant and the manager will say, &#39;Oh no, it&#39;s on the house.</p><p>The trick is always to write in pairs because if at least two people find it funny, you&#39;ve immediately halved the odds of it not being funny.</p><p>It&#39;s not common for a woman on television, especially if she&#39;s the mom of the family, to be funny. She&#39;s usually a straight man or foil.</p><p>I watch things that are fun, or funny, or interesting.</p><p>Funny enough, if you are looking at people these days who are putting Botox in their face and getting all sorts of plastic surgery, we look at them and go, I can tell you&#39;ve had Botox. I can tell you&#39;ve had plastic surgery. You look really strange to me. But no one&#39;s saying anything. We&#39;re just accepting the fact that they&#39;re strange-looking.</p><p>No one ever thought Clint Eastwood was funny, but he was.</p><p>I mean, I - it&#39;s so funny, I am, you know, I am, you know, a working woman out in the world, but I still live with my parents half the time. I&#39;ve been sort of taking this very long, stuttering period of moving out.</p><p>There&#39;s always an article coming out, saying, &#39;The new thing is funny women!&#39;</p><p>It&#39;s funny, I never considered that people are going to see me on the show and maybe stop me on the subway.</p><p>I never thought of myself as like, a funny person.</p><p>Literature has drawn a funny perimeter that other art forms haven&#39;t.</p><p>The kind of funny irony is that a lot of people talk about ethical meat eating as if it&#39;s a way to care about things, but also not to alienate yourself from the rest of the world. But it&#39;s so much more alienating than vegetarianism.</p><p>I&#39;m not funny. People assume that because my books are funny, I&#39;ll be funny in real life. It&#39;s the inevitable disappointment of meeting me.</p><p>You find out in life that people really like you funny. So what do you give &#39;em? Humor. And then if you show them the other side, they don&#39;t like you as much. I find, too, that I can hide behind the idiot&#39;s mask being funny, and you never see the sorrow or the pain.</p><p>At the end of the day it&#39;s got to be a good movie, it&#39;s got to be a funny movie, and it&#39;s got to make people think, &#39;Hey, I couldn&#39;t have spent my time any better.&#39;</p><p>When you&#39;re out of sight for as long as I was, there&#39;s a funny feeling of betrayal that comes over people when they see you again.</p><p>I&#39;d like to do a film which is funny.</p><p>Japanese people have a funny habit of abbreviating names.</p><p>I find it very easy playing Bond. I think he&#39;s hilarious. He gets himself into some extraordinarily funny situations.</p><p>At home in L.A., Sunday is lazy. It&#39;s the wife and me lying in bed with coffee, watching &#39;The Soup&#39; or something funny on TiVo. The kid will occasionally join us. Eventually, breakfast is at a place down the street called Paty&#39;s. And we always have some kind of great dinner - my wife makes a great roast beef.</p><p>What other people call dark and despairing, I call funny.</p><p>The funny thing is that I&#39;m the girl who no one sees at the beach. Ask anyone who&#39;s traveled with me. Normally, I&#39;m in so many layers, I look like Lawrence of Arabia!</p><p>Who do I like? I am a big fan of French and Saunders - not that that they are particularly stand-up I have to say, but I think they have been great for women and they are of themselves just incredibly funny whether they are male or female.</p><p>The thing I thought about doing it was it&#39;s Comic Relief and you&#39;ve got to be funny. So although I did try to sing properly it obviously has hilarious results when you can&#39;t sing.</p><p>I made a supreme effort not to do that thing that parents do, which is to bore people without children to death by going on and on about how funny their children are, so there&#39;s none of that hopefully.</p><p>I thought I was funny as a kid.</p><p>It used to be that you had to make female TV characters perfect so no one would be offended by your &#39;portrayal&#39; of women. Even when I started out on &#39;The Office&#39; eight years ago, we could write our male characters funny and flawed, but not the women. And now, thankfully, it&#39;s completely different.</p><p>People don&#39;t want to listen to a celebrity tweeting about their charities and shows. That&#39;s why comedy writers do well - we put out little funny ideas.</p><p>The reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks. If my daughter has a mediocre sense of humor, I&#39;m just gonna tell her, &#39;Be a staff writer for a sitcom. Because they&#39;ll have to hire you, they can&#39;t really fire you, and you don&#39;t have to produce that much. It&#39;ll be awesome.&#39;</p><p>I don&#39;t hate humanity and I&#39;m not interested in people who do. Although, it&#39;s funny, actually, some of my favorite writers really do. Like Martin Amis. My dirty secret. &#39;London Fields&#39; is one of my favorite books ever. And it&#39;s indefensible! But he&#39;s so funny... I forgive him everything.</p><p>I used to say, &#39;Man, I think I&#39;d be a really good dad. I&#39;ll be a great provider. I&#39;m funny I&#39;ll go on trips with them - I&#39;ll do all sorts of stuff.&#39; But the momming? I&#39;m not made for that. I have a really good mom I know what she put into it.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, I do try to maintain health. I started doing Bikram yoga which is that hothouse yoga, the 105 degrees yoga for 90 minutes. It&#39;s great, you purge out all the sweat and you&#39;re drinking water.</p><p>It&#39;s funny how many people will come to Vegas to see your show where they might not come out to see you unless you come to their hometown.</p><p>It&#39;s funny: I&#39;m a lifelong musician, but because I principally play the piano it&#39;s been a solitary thing.</p><p>Our records, if you have a dark sense of humor, were funny, but our records weren&#39;t about comedy. They were about protests, fantasy, confrontation and all that.</p><p>It&#39;s funny how people who ain&#39;t never been down there can think that America is so fair and that we should be alright. It&#39;s funny that the people who have their foot on our neck are telling us, &#39;Get up. What&#39;s wrong with you?&#39;</p><p>It&#39;s a funny show. The characters are surprisingly likable, given how ugly they are. We&#39;ve got this huge cast of characters that we can move around. And over the last few seasons, we&#39;ve explored some of the secondary characters&#39; personal lives a bit more.</p><p>Laurence Olivier said in an interview once that when he plays a tragedy he always aims for the funny parts, and the other way around. Because in a comedy you look for what&#39;s serious. I think that&#39;s true. Sometimes things are really funny if you&#39;re absolutely earnest. If you&#39;re really serious, it&#39;s hilarious.</p><p>I never know when I am being funny, and the other way too. I don&#39;t think you can think about that. I don&#39;t think you can try to be funny. Some people are just funny.</p><p>I tend to head for what&#39;s amusing because a lot of things aren&#39;t happy. But usually you can find a funny side to practically anything.</p><p>The funny thing is, Dennis Miller got me back into comedy.</p><p>I&#39;m half Jewish, I&#39;m half black, I look in-between. I dress funny. I play all these different styles of music on one record. It&#39;s like, What is he doing?</p><p>The fans of &#39;The Hunger Games,&#39; of the book, are very passionate. It&#39;s funny: Even at my concerts there are people holding up &#39;Cinna&#39; signs.</p><p>It&#39;s funny how the music industry is enraged about the Internet and the way things are copied without being paid for. But you know why people steal the music? Because they can&#39;t afford the music.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, I can sit through the worst horror film ever made but even a quite good romantic comedy can drive me nuts.</p><p>Life&#39;s pretty funny when you&#39;re objectively on the outside looking at it.</p><p>People used to be funny about approaching me, but now they seem to think I&#39;m as sane as anyone who&#39;s done what I&#39;ve done in movies can be.</p><p>You know, you can touch a stick of dynamite, but if you touch a venomous snake it&#39;ll turn around and bite you and kill you so fast it&#39;s not even funny.</p><p>I have this horrible sense of humor where I think discomfort is funny - partly because I experience discomfort a lot, and it&#39;s a way of laughing at it and getting a release.</p><p>I can never tell when something is funny. I just have to do it onstage and find out.</p><p>My parents are very funny when they have to deal with anything racy or off-color. They usually pretend they don&#39;t speak English.</p><p>Well, I mean, if a joke or humor is bawdy, it&#39;s got to be funny enough to warrant it. You can&#39;t just have it bawdy or dirty just for the sake of being that - it&#39;s got to be funny.</p><p>In this world, everyone wants to know everything about you, and I think that&#39;s funny.</p><p>I&#39;m just not one of those naturally funny, relaxed actors who enjoy the spotlight and are so good at it.</p><p>I turned down &#39;Some Like It Hot.&#39; See how smart I am? I felt I couldn&#39;t bring anything funny to it. The outfit was funny. I don&#39;t need to compete with the wardrobe.</p><p>I mean, sometimes... a comedian becomes an actor, and they just don&#39;t deliver, because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny, and the bottom line of acting is to be truthful, and they get that mixed up sometimes, or don&#39;t even notice that that&#39;s the thing.</p><p>I need to be cheered up a lot. I think funny people are people who need to be cheered up.</p><p>Boston is actually the capital of the world. You didn&#39;t know that? We breed smart-ass, quippy, funny people. Not that I&#39;m one of them. I just sorta sneaked in under the radar.</p><p>It&#39;s not so much what you learn about Mumbai, it&#39;s what you learn about yourself, really. It&#39;s a funny old hippie thing, but it&#39;s true as well. You find out a lot about yourself and your tolerance, and about your inclusiveness.</p><p>I was lucky. My family is wonderful. And it&#39;s funny, because most of my best friends come from very large families. So it always felt as if I had lots of siblings, though in the end I had to leave them and go home. I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.</p><p>I think there have always been funny women, from Carol Burnett to Joan Rivers. When the audience sees a woman, they innately know she&#39;s worked twice as hard to get there, she&#39;s had to prove that she can be the leader, first, and then be funny on top of it. She has to emit a confidence that she&#39;s in control.</p><p>Justin Timberlake is everything, and what more could you want in a person? He&#39;s funny. He&#39;s cute. He&#39;s great. He just understands. I get him and he gets me, and that&#39;s cool.</p><p>When humor can be made to alternate with melancholy, one has a success, but when the same things are funny and melancholic at the same time, it&#39;s just wonderful.</p><p>When human judgment and big data intersect there are some funny things that happen.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, when bands or younger musicians ask me: &#39;So, what does it take to make it?&#39; Well, first explain to me what you mean by &#39;making it&#39;: Do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood?</p><p>I mean it&#39;s funny, playing music, how of course you want it to do well, you want them to like it, but it&#39;s not competitive like an election, it&#39;s the Olympics, it&#39;s not a Formula 1 race. The Billboard charts are just to show you what people like.</p><p>It&#39;s funny how making odd noises can get you into strange situations sometimes.</p><p>I love things made out of animals. It&#39;s just so funny to think of someone saying, &#39;I need a letter opener. I guess I&#39;ll have to kill a deer.</p><p>It&#39;s funny - if you impersonate somebody, they have no idea it&#39;s them.</p><p>Being funny, it turns out, is like being a bank.

As long as everyone believes in you, you are fine.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, as you live through something you&#39;re not aware of it.</p><p>Maybe I&#39;m delusional but I&#39;m usually funny. It&#39;s not 100% but I have a pretty good batting average.</p><p>If Joy Behar or Sherri Shepherd was a dude, they&#39;d be off TV. They&#39;re not funny enough for dudes.

He was my inspiration.</p><p>As a writer, or as a filmmaker, you have to present yourself, and part of what yourself is is what you&#39;re interested in, or what you think is funny, or what you think is sad, or what you think is horrible.</p><p>People ask &#39;do you make a conscious effort not to swear?&#39; - if you&#39;re doing silly stuff you&#39;re not tempted to put swearing in. All the comics from my childhood, who were funny without swearing, were the people that influenced me. What I do is quite traditional anyway.</p><p>I always find it kind of embarrassing, kind of funny, and kind of exciting. In New York I&#39;m recognized a lot, although nobody says anything. You know, they stare at you just a second too long. But in Paris it&#39;s not as commonplace to be recognized.</p><p>I don&#39;t think, &#39;Gee, I&#39;d like to dress this person.&#39; There was a picture in Us magazine. It was a jersey dress, and Courtney Love was wearing it. I have this thing about Courtney Love, this funny worship.</p><p>I grew up in a funny way.</p><p>I got to dress up in funny clothes and run around New Zealand with a bow and arrow for 18 months, how bad could that be?</p><p>It was always a fantasy of mine growing up - my favorite program was always &#39;Little House on the Prairie&#39; - so I always wanted to wear those looks. When I was a child, I wouldn&#39;t let my mom put me in anything but calico dresses and now... whaddaya know, every day I&#39;m in a calico dress, basically, so it&#39;s kind of funny.</p><p>Something about New York, man: You can do more comedy there probably than you can anywhere in the world. If you&#39;re interested in being funny, New York is the place to go.</p><p>It&#39;s funny with fiction - once you cut something, it hasn&#39;t happened anymore.</p><p>I read the script for Wonder Boys, and I said that was almost perfect, it was so classy, cool and funny. It&#39;s a really specific thing. We stuck to it, it turned out good and a lot of people liked it.</p><p>It&#39;s funny that there was so much disturbance about having a Catholic in the White House with Kennedy, and when we finally get a religion in the White House that&#39;s causing a lot of conflicts, and concerns, and disturbances for a lot of people, it&#39;s in the Bush Administration.</p><p>If you use tact you can say anything, then make it funny.</p><p>I think Chris Rock at the Oscars was a great example. I thought that was intellectually hilarious. The Gap starts a war with Banana Republic... That to me was funny.</p><p>I&#39;d love to date somebody cool, fun, funny.</p><p>You know, I&#39;ve always thought that it would be really funny if somebody made a romantic comedy where absolutely everything went well from beginning to end.</p><p>I&#39;m very silly as a person, but quality silliness on-screen has more of an art to it. Harrison Ford, whom I was in &#39;Morning Glory&#39; with, has mastered that dry funny better than anyone.</p><p>This is going to sound really funny. I have a poster of Zac Efron on my wall! I think every girl has a poster of him in their room so, why not join the club!</p><p>I&#39;m an unorthodox type of guy, a funny guy - at least I think I&#39;m funny. And one of the things I like to do is come up with nicknames for myself.</p><p>Hurried and worried until we&#39;re buried, and there&#39;s no curtain call, Lifes a very funny proposition after all.</p><p>In a funny way, poems are suited to modern life. They&#39;re short, they&#39;re intense. Nobody has time to read a 700-page book. People read magazines, and a poem takes less time than an article.</p><p>I don&#39;t have a caustic sense of humor. What I find funny, that humor comes from a much gentler place.</p><p>On the stage you&#39;re there, it&#39;s live. There&#39;s a beginning, a middle, an end. When something is funny you hear it right away.</p><p>Some of the writers I admire who seem very, very funny and very emotional to me can develop a closeness with the reader without giving too much of themselves away. Lorrie Moore comes to mind, as does David Sedaris. When they write, the reader thinks that they&#39;re being trusted as a friend.</p><p>I think a lot of humor is about distracting yourself. Pretend you&#39;re not trying to make it funny. Because for some reason the effort to be funny smells like sulphur in our culture.</p><p>It&#39;s funny. People often compare me to other humor essayists. They&#39;re usually quite nice comparisons I will accept those gladly. But I am always sort of appalled at the idea of being lumped with other, more chick-y female writers. And the truth is probably that neither comparison is accurate.</p><p>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is a form of service journalism. To be successful, I think it has to be a combination of a good story, it has to be funny, and it also needs to be packed with useful information.</p><p>With improv, it&#39;s a combination of listening and not trying to be funny.</p><p>For a culture that has such a problem with death, we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot, killed and blown up, and we find it funny and sexy and all those things. But, the reality of it is that every day people die, and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.</p><p>Sometimes I feel like there are people just waiting for me to fall. The funny thing is, I can&#39;t give them anything. I have just never been a partier, even in school.</p><p>It&#39;s funny. When I saw the script in my inbox and it said &#39;Sparkle,&#39; I thought, &#39;For real? It&#39;s really called &#39;Sparkle?&#39;&#39; I was wondering, too, how does &#39;Jordin Sparks as Sparkle&#39; sound?</p><p>I&#39;m so single. It&#39;s funny. I&#39;m usually a relationship girl. I love being in love and having a partner in crime. But it&#39;s good to be your own partner in crime. God, that makes me sound like I have multiple-personality disorder.</p><p>I think things are funny when the character is taking it totally seriously.</p><p>The word &#39;Spanx&#39; was funny. It made people laugh. No one ever forgot it.</p><p>It&#39;s painful for me to watch someone who isn&#39;t funny. It&#39;s horrifying to sit in the back and watch some guy who just totally sucks.</p><p>If you are a great dramatic actor then you often don&#39;t know if people are enjoying your stuff at all because they are sitting there in silence. But with comedy it&#39;s a simple premise. If it&#39;s funny, people laugh. If it&#39;s not, they don&#39;t.</p><p>The surprising thing is that I was not funny in high school. I was always jealous of the funny kids because they always got the girls. I couldn&#39;t tell a joke to save my life.</p><p>I don&#39;t really necessarily think I&#39;m a funny guy, but I like the opportunity to take on something that I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m the best at doing.</p><p>I&#39;m never afraid to try something if I think it&#39;s funny. And I know I&#39;ll regret it if I don&#39;t.</p><p>Here is my prescription to heal all wounds. Watch the film &#39;Funny Girl&#39; at least five times, eat at least 45 chocolate bars, and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex. I truly believe that, through a combination of Nutella, old pals and Barbra Streisand, we can achieve happiness and, very probably, world peace.</p><p>My size has helped make me an amazing performer too. The cliche of the Funny Fat Friend: I absolutely was that character - I am that character... It&#39;s a complicated bag of tools I acquired, and I&#39;ve put them all to work onstage.</p><p>It sounds funny, but the 2008 Olympics were something that just kind of happened, and I was lucky they came at a point when I was uninjured and well prepared. As a gymnast, you can&#39;t ask for much more.</p><p>I think I have an inner confidence that my tastes are pretty simple, that what I find funny finds a wide audience. I&#39;m not particularly intellectual or clever or minority-focused in my creative instincts. And I&#39;m certainly not aware of suppressing more sophisticated ambitions.</p><p>Funny things tend not to happen to me. I am not a natural comic. I need to think about things a lot before I can be even remotely amusing.</p><p>This may sound funny, but as much as the &#39;Today&#39; show matured me, it also was something of a cocoon. I&#39;d been happy there. I never went into the boss&#39;s office and pounded my fist on the desk, saying, &#39;Give me more money! Give me a prime-time show!&#39;</p><p>I think I&#39;m funny because my family, my siblings were funny.</p><p>It&#39;s funny how the hippies and the punks tried to get rid of the conservatives, but they always seem to get the upper hand in the end.</p><p>I show them the funny part, the silly part, the laughing part, the crazy part and then the really deep, deep part where I&#39;m talking from my heart to these people. Because I&#39;ve been through everything they&#39;ve been through.</p><p>Especially with a comedy, you&#39;ve got the clear cut goal of trying to make a scene funny. It&#39;s not like drama where you&#39;re trying to achieve some kind of emotion or trying to further the story along. You&#39;re trying to figure out what&#39;s the funniest way to do something.</p><p>I&#39;ve started looking at my own father a bit funny. He assures me, though, that I really am the son of a Scottish postman.</p><p>I don&#39;t know now if I&#39;m funny. I just keep talking and hope that I hit something that&#39;s funny.</p><p>In terms of the creative side of it, it&#39;s really been a thing where you come up with the funny stuff is usually at a bar or out talking to people or whatever.</p><p>It&#39;s funny because I think a lot of it is simply... We&#39;ve never considered ourselves satirists, but because we&#39;re on Comedy Central and because we&#39;re South Park on Comedy Central, we can do any topic we want.</p><p>No, writing musicals is the hardest thing in the world. And it was really funny, because I remember when the South Park movie came out, there were some critics that said, &#39;Well it&#39;s obvious that in order to get it to be 90 minutes they filled some time with music.&#39;</p><p>Nothing&#39;s funny about someone who&#39;s successful.</p><p>TV is easier: it&#39;s all planned out for you and the audience is there to see a show and they are all pumped up but when you are in a comedy club, you have to be really funny to win them over.</p><p>It&#39;s funny because I&#39;m a sucker for glitz and glitter when it comes to clothes and nail polish, but with my makeup, I&#39;m more comfortable with a natural look. It feels more like me.</p><p>It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s funny.</p><p>I&#39;m on so late I&#39;m definitely the last seconds of anyone&#39;s attention. So I just want to give them something dumb to laugh at, so they go, &#39;That&#39;s funny,&#39; then fall asleep.</p><p>I recently spent quite a bit of time in Sheffield, England, which is where I&#39;m from. I wouldn&#39;t move back there, but it&#39;s funny when you spend a bit of time in the place where you were brought up. You kind of realize how that place has had quite a big effect on you or made you a certain way.</p><p>I listen like mad to any conversation taking place next to me just trying to hear why this is funny. Women&#39;s restrooms are especially great. I wash my hands twice waiting for people to come in and start talking.</p><p>I don&#39;t just try to be funny.</p><p>It&#39;s harder to be funny if you&#39;re handsome than if you&#39;re very normal-looking. It&#39;s just more relatable. You&#39;re the underdog. I mean it&#39;s funny to see people struggle, and you don&#39;t buy that Brad Pitt is struggling, you know that guy could be the most skill-less guy in the world, but if you look like that you will be fine for the rest of your life.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, because I never think of myself as Little Miss All-Together.</p><p>When I was a kid I didn&#39;t feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably shouldn&#39;t say it, but, I didn&#39;t think anything was funny. So I used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my step-dad at the time and I didn&#39;t think anything was funny. I couldn&#39;t laugh.</p><p>I realized my family was funny, because nobody ever wanted to leave our house.</p><p>You know what? I never really factor Hollywood into anything. I&#39;m a black actor, so I can&#39;t really control what Hollywood thinks. I gotta go do my thing, and my jokes have got to be funny. Whatever I do has got to be great.</p><p>I really wanted to just be a musician. I didn&#39;t want to be anything else, but I was funny and all that.</p><p>For years I used to bore my wife over lunch with stories about funny incidents.</p><p>Movies these days have made killers into funny people. What&#39;s that all about? I&#39;ve got kids and family and friends, and I don&#39;t like bad things. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re funny, and it&#39;s irresponsible to make movies that don&#39;t show you how that&#39;s not good.</p><p>I tell you, it&#39;s funny because the only time I think about HIV is when I have to take my medicine twice a day.</p><p>A comedian&#39;s body is funny as well as his mind being funny, his whole personage is funny.</p><p>I want to be in &#39;Funny Girl.&#39; And I want Ryan Murphy to direct it.</p><p>It would be pretty funny to see a Beverly Hills white girl with mad rap skills.</p><p>Being a funny person does an awful lot of things to you. You feel that you mustn&#39;t get serious with people. They don&#39;t expect it from you, and they don&#39;t want to see it. You&#39;re not entitled to be serious, you&#39;re a clown.</p><p>Comedy is not funny. Comedy is hard work and timing and lots and lots of rehearsals.</p><p>That&#39;s why I like to get out there, and get people to see the other side of Mitt, and know us in a different reflection when you see the family and how funny he is with the boys and with the grandkids. And you know, just what a super guy he is. That&#39;s part of what I am doing, is letting people see the other side of Mitt.</p><p>Funny is funny.</p><p>Memories are doing funny things to us.</p><p>My dad loved to laugh. He was very funny and very silly.</p><p>Europe is scooters. Europe is five young people on one bench sharing a chocolate bar. Their idea of entertainment and fun is so much different than ours, which is exactly why a movie about them would be funny.</p><p>So that&#39;s why one of my rules of parody writing is that it&#39;s gotta be funny regardless of whether you know the source material. It has to work on its own merit.</p><p>People never ask people doing serious music, &#39;Do you ever think about doing funny music?&#39;</p><p>I&#39;ve never really understood that. It&#39;s a funny thing people sometimes accuse us of condescending to our characters somehow-that to me is kind of inexplicable.</p><p>Ninety-eight per cent of laughter is nothing to do with jokes, which do not deserve to bear the weight of all the funny stuff in the world.</p><p>The history of the relationship between comedy and swimming is short indeed. Of course it is always funny when someone falls into water, but that&#39;s about it.</p><p>Married with Children&#39; was racy. It was sexist. It was a lot of things, but mostly it was funny.;Katey Sagal;funny 26270;My mother was a terrific force in my life. Wartime-generation woman, hadn&#39;t gone to university but should have done. Was very funny, very verbal, very clever, very witty.;Ian Hislop;funny 26271;I was doing sketches that were funny but socially irresponsible. I felt I was deliberately being encouraged and I was overwhelmed.;Dave Chappelle;funny 26272;It&#39;s funny recently I&#39;ve started to notice people&#39;s impersonations of me, and it&#39;s basically like a hyperactive child.;Dave Grohl;funny 26273;It&#39;s funny I actually made poorer decisions when I sobered up then when I was screwed up.;Corey Feldman;funny 26274;It&#39;s funny, having the same name as someone. Me, Emma Watson and Emma Stone, the amount of times I&#39;ve been called Emma Watson or Emma Stone is so funny. It&#39;s just &#39;cause we&#39;re all named Emma. None of us look alike.;Emma Roberts;funny 26275;I don&#39;t really have a type of guy I like. It&#39;s just like nice guys, cute boys I mean, ones that are funny.;Emma Roberts;funny 26276;But I think Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang really got that thing where, if a movie reads really funny and then has some dramatic or violent or sinister stuff in it, you can&#39;t forget that primarily it has to be even funnier than you read it or that other stuff doesn&#39;t work.;Robert Downey, Jr.;funny 26277;I wish I could be as thin as Jessica Simpson. I think she looks gorgeous! I have had Jessica on my show several times, and I can tell you that girl is genuine and funny with a great self-deprecating sense of humor.;Rachael Ray;funny 26278;And at the time, it is funny how you can look at something and say, for example with my shoulder injury, when it first happened I said this is the worst thing that could happen to me. Why me, why now? Now I look back and say it was probably the best thing that happened to me.;Drew Brees;funny 26279;I think we&#39;re the only jokeless show on television. I mean really, we have no setups and no punch lines. It&#39;s not a joke show. There are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human.;Rainn Wilson;funny 26280;We&#39;ve got a bunch of new writers now who tell me they grew up watching The Simpsons. It&#39;s bizarre, and they&#39;re writing some very funny stuff.;Matt Groening;funny 26281;Sometimes people get mad at The Simpsons&#39; subversive story telling, but there&#39;s another message in there, which is a celebration of making wild, funny stories.;Matt Groening;funny 26282;I can always get better. A lot of my ex-girlfriends don&#39;t think I&#39;m funny.;Dane Cook;funny 26283;I didn&#39;t plan to be the rude middle-class comedian. You write a certain type of joke that you find funny, and mine happen to be often rude. Yes, it&#39;s juvenile, but that&#39;s me.;Jimmy Carr;funny 26284;Only bad golfers are lucky. They&#39;re the ones bouncing balls off trees, curbs, turtles and cars. Good golfers have bad luck. When you hit the ball straight, a funny bounce is bound to be unlucky.;Lee Trevino;funny 26285;Music is more difficult - try naming a political band. The Dead Kennedys. The Dead Kennedys are political, but they are more funny than they are political.;Thom Yorke;funny 26286;We sit in a room for months trying to think of funny things.;David Walliams;funny 26287;I love a smart, well-written show, and &#39;30 Rock,&#39; well, you can&#39;t get any better than that. Tina Fey poos funny. There&#39;s nothing that she does that isn&#39;t funny. That show is an example of how brilliant she is. It&#39;s so smart. They&#39;ve done some brilliant commentary about the &#39;Housewives&#39; with &#39;Queen of Jordan,&#39; their show-within-the-show.;Andy Cohen;funny 26288;I am accusing him of stealing my best material, he was a very funny man.;Frank Carson;funny 26289;It&#39;s unbearable when someone changes around you. Just imagine that your life partner changes, then it is difficult to cope with. Or your mother. Or your father. They were strong and now they&#39;re like a baby - it&#39;s not so funny.;Michael Haneke;funny 26290;&#39;Funny Games&#39; was conceived as a provocation. My other films are different. If people feel my other films are, or respond to them as provocation, then that&#39;s quite different. &#39;Funny Games&#39; is the only one of mine where my intention was to provoke the audience.;Michael Haneke;funny 26291;When I first envisioned &#39;Funny Games&#39; in the mid-1990s, it was my intention to have an American audience watch the movie. It is a reaction to a certain American cinema, its violence, its naivety, the way American cinema toys with human beings. In many American films, violence is made consumable.;Michael Haneke;funny 26292;I have an inability to enjoy things, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re in comedy. If we were happy, we wouldn&#39;t be funny, I guess.;Paul Feig;funny 26293;For years, it&#39;s driven me crazy that women don&#39;t have better roles, especially in comedies. I know so many funny women but I always felt... misogynist streak is too strong a term - but a dismissiveness.;Paul Feig;funny 26294;I love funny people, and when I&#39;m with funny people, or people who are amusing in their weirdness, I love it. Because that to me is funny, as opposed to someone who stops and says, &#39;Hey let me tell you a joke.</p><p>What&#39;s so great about working with really funny women is that vanity comes second. Whatever makes it real and funny, they&#39;re going to go for, and it&#39;s just great.</p><p>What I don&#39;t like is when I see stuff that I know has had a lot of improv done or is playing around where there&#39;s no purpose to the scene other than to just be funny. What you don&#39;t want is funny scene, funny scene, funny scene, and now here&#39;s the epiphany scene and then the movie&#39;s over.</p><p>Women&#39;s humor seems to be a little more supportive. It&#39;s just kind of trying to make the other one laugh through funny voices and kind of talking about other people. I respond to that. I feel less like I&#39;m going to get beat up in a room full of women than I do in a room full of guys.</p><p>It&#39;s funny when people say you have sex appeal or call you the next Brad Pitt. I just laugh. I&#39;m not that. I don&#39;t want to be that.</p><p>By no means do I want to be a piece of meat for the rest of my career. It&#39;s funny when you get asked to do a talk show, and then they follow it up with requesting you take your shirt off.</p><p>See, I don&#39;t really go after girls. Most of the girlfriends I&#39;ve had have come after me. So it&#39;s really funny when girls get offended because I don&#39;t hit on them.</p><p>It&#39;s interesting that whenever I meet some of the other Bond girls, I always have something in common, and it is an interesting sorority. We all share about our Bonds. &#39;Did your Bond do that?&#39; &#39;Yes mine did!&#39; So it is quite funny conversations. We may as well be in high school.</p><p>You know, Stephen says, in the movies no one ever goes to the bathroom. They shave, they brush their teeth. He goes right at this sort of funny taboo we have about the bathroom, and he turned it into this nightmare, you know, your worst fear of what&#39;s in there.</p><p>Funny is an attitude.</p><p>My main point is to be funny if I can slip a message in there, fine.</p><p>Things can be funny only when we are in fun. When we&#39;re &#39;dead earnest,&#39; humor is the only thing that is dead.</p><p>Funny is not a color. Being black is only good from the time you get from the curtain to the microphone.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe that anybody has come to a conclusion on why something is funny. It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s ridiculous and it&#39;s ridiculous for different reasons at different times.</p><p>There are so many funny women in the world, and there has been for so many years, so I&#39;ll be happy when people can just move on from that, and things can just be &#39;comedies&#39; and not &#39;female&#39; or &#39;male,&#39; and everyone gets an equal opportunity.</p><p>But if something funny happens, I can&#39;t resist. I have to tell the people.</p><p>I would like to do something modern and possibly funny.</p><p>I&#39;ve always enjoyed making people laugh. But in order for me to be funny, I have to get ticked off about something.</p><p>Everyone comes up to me saying, &#39;Cooee, Julie! Hello!&#39; as if I know them. Of course I don&#39;t bloody know them. Am I flummoxed by it? Sometimes. I think, &#39;Ooh, love, go easy.&#39; For a time, I did feel this pressure that I had to be funny, but it passes.</p><p>Oh all the time when Victoria Wood and I did our series. There were people asking &#39;Can women be funny?&#39; People still ask that. It&#39;s like asking: &#39;Can women breathe in and out?&#39;</p><p>I was the little, funny one. I felt I was the child among grown women.</p><p>It&#39;s a real primal thing, watching someone get hurt. It&#39;s funny and accessible.</p><p>It&#39;s a funny thing - when I&#39;m crazed with work, spending time with my children relaxes me. Yet, at the end of a long weekend with them, the very thing I need to relax is a little work and time away from them!</p><p>It&#39;s really funny because the same people who loved me as Stringer Bell were the same people that were watching &#39;Daddy&#39;s Little Girls&#39; literally in tears.</p><p>I had seen movies before that that had made me laugh, but I had never seen anything even remotely close to as funny as Richard Pryor was, just standing there talking.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t totally rule out doing Letterman or the Tonight Show if I had a set that I just happened to write that I thought was funny but was still appropriate for network censors. But I&#39;m not going to go out of my way.</p><p>The audience changes every night. You&#39;re the same person. You have to speak your mind and do the stuff that you think is funny and makes you laugh.</p><p>The misconception is that standup comics are always on. I don&#39;t know any really funny comics that are annoying and constantly trying to be funny all the time.</p><p>I used to say I wanted somebody funny and intelligent, but kindness is the most important quality in a man.</p><p>The great thing is that the funny side of getting old is fuel for my comedy.</p><p>I think it&#39;s always funny when you see kids do Shakespeare.</p><p>But with comedy it&#39;s a simple premise. If it&#39;s funny, people laugh. If it&#39;s not, they don&#39;t.</p><p>Hitchcock had a charm about him. He was very funny at times. He was incredibly brilliant in his field of suspense.</p><p>One lion thinks it&#39;s just hilarious to tackle us. He&#39;s very funny about it... and we always know when it will happen.</p><p>Working with Chaplin was very amusing and strange. His films are so funny, but working with him, I found him to be a very serious man.

Even though it&#39;s a comedy and there are serious moments, I really felt like Leo felt like a real person. It didn&#39;t feel like I was playing myself.

If someone gets hit in the face with a bat, falls down, and gets back up, it&#39;s funny. If they stay down and their jaw is wired shut in the next scene, it&#39;s really tragic and weird. You have to pretend it doesn&#39;t hurt.</p><p>It&#39;s a funny relationship that makeup artists have. I always feel kind of like a dentist. People look at me and think of pain.</p><p>I love Charlie, Billy Burke&#39;s character. Writing for him is so spectacular, he&#39;s so funny and wry and every scene he&#39;s in he just takes.

I use it for social issues and I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s for. I do a few things - I mess around with music a lot because that&#39;s a passion of mine. If something strikes me and I want to share it, I do.</p><p>He is very dry but also very funny... I think people tend to feel odd when I do my act.

You gotta just do what you think is funny. Just be obstreperous to everybody.</p><p>You know how it is with writing. You just write what you want to write.

It&#39;s impossible to predict anything.</p><p>I&#39;ve dated some women who have turned me on to some funny things that are strange for men to actually do, but these things have become part of my process.

Who knows?</p><p>I&#39;m one of those hovering mothers and I know it&#39;s really important to have an independent child, so I&#39;m trying to back off, but it&#39;s hard.

For a horror film, it was intelligent, it was funny, it took a laugh at itself.</p><p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be serious, like Daniel Day-Lewis. No one really dreams of being a comic actor, do they? Now I realise how stupid that is - and it&#39;s because comic acting isn&#39;t taken seriously enough. It&#39;s a discipline. You know instantly - either you&#39;re funny and getting the laughs, or you&#39;re not.</p><p>I think there&#39;s something in the fact that it&#39;s hard to be good looking and funny. You have to have an oddball quality people have to sympathise with you to find you funny.</p><p>One of the things I like about acting is that, in a funny way, I come back to myself.</p><p>For a Catholic kid in parochial school, the only way to survive the beatings - by classmates, not the nuns - was to be the funny guy.</p><p>It&#39;s sort of an action flick.

It connects all the way through. I don&#39;t distance myself from any of it.</p><p>Even as a kid I was never the generator of humor, but I always knew who was funny, who to hang out with.</p><p>In Italy, I had an Afro, and a lot of the kids came up and felt my hair. It really was funny. I wish I had understood Italian.</p><p>I think a lot comes from having the experience of doing stand-up comedy. It allows you to figure out the psychology of an audience what things are funny and not.</p><p>Life is funny and it is interesting how we make it as serious as possible.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, though, speaking of fathers and sons, because me and John Goodman played father and son, like, five or six years ago in the film &#39;Death Sentence,&#39; and I got back with him again in &#39;Inside Llewyn Davis.&#39;</p><p>It&#39;s funny that I got to do &#39;On the Road&#39; because the thing that had the biggest impact on me growing up was reading books. I was very inspired by the book and this spirit of Dean Moriarty and how envious we all are of somebody who can be that carefree.</p><p>It&#39;s funny - I read that women look to chiseled-faced guys for one-night stands, and to round-faced guys for marriage. When I&#39;m rounder in the face, I like to say, &#39;This is my long-term look.&#39; Or &#39;This is my wife-and-kids look right here.&#39;</p><p>This is the great thing about Northern Ireland.

So it&#39;s often funny and surprising how my ideas end up lost in translation.</p><p>The most important thing is to write material that YOU think is funny.

People dying is never funny. Protest puppets are always funny.</p><p>I think that Obama is very cool. And I think he&#39;s clever, and I think he can be witty. But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s funny in either the way that Reagan was funny - or John McCain and Dick Cheney are both funny in that ruthless, kind of mean way.</p><p>We want to be funny. We want to make people laugh... We&#39;ll do whatever it takes.</p><p>But, sooner or later I&#39;d love to do a comedy.

Comic-Con junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow. Isn&#39;t that funny? The tables have turned.</p><p>I think the Cold War works as a great analogy or simile for different kinds of conflict.

If there&#39;s ever any kind of tension, I&#39;ll always be the one to try and be funny to loosen things up.</p><p>It&#39;s funny - nowadays people that are famous get chased by paparazzi. They have this fame, but they don&#39;t have the money to hide from it.</p><p>Being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in.</p><p>You can&#39;t be funny for funny&#39;s sake.

Or funny.</p><p>Back in the &#39;70s, like one of my favorite movies ever was &#39;The Bad News Bears&#39;, and that was a kids&#39; movie, but I don&#39;t think of it that way. I think of it as just a great movie because Walter Matthau was so funny and so harsh with those kids.</p><p>I just couldn&#39;t go back to Suddenly Susan after David Strickland&#39;s suicide. I didn&#39;t see how we could make the show light and funny any more.</p><p>It&#39;s funny now how much we look at - whatever you want to call it: art, design, culture stuff, film - online, and how in the online world, you&#39;re instantly global.</p><p>One can always come up with funny lists and jokes. You know what? I take it back. Not everyone can always come up with funny lists and some jokes. I&#39;m very lucky to have a gift where I can do that pretty ably.</p><p>People forget how outcast &#39;They Might Be Giants&#39; can be.

I remember when I didn&#39;t have any money, and my only car was mom&#39;s Hyundai.</p><p>Mmmm... the comedy that matters is the comedy you pull out of thin air.

I&#39;m really kind of stupid at home and more serious in public.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, because I did all of these interviews as soon as I had the baby, and they were asking questions, and I really didn&#39;t have an idea of anything, because I was so blurry.</p><p>That&#39;s a funny thing, fame. People definitely do treat you differently.

It&#39;s funny to me that we&#39;re expected to keep quiet just because of who we are. Why do I lose my right to speak my mind because I&#39;m famous?</p><p>I&#39;m not a movie guy, I&#39;m not a TV sitcom guy, but whatever seems to fit and is funny is good for me.</p><p>You have to understand the tone of the movie, because if it&#39;s supposed to be funny, it can be funny violent like the Home Alone stuff, but you have to really understand the tone of what you&#39;re doing and make the action work for that and for the character.</p><p>I really love &#39;Soapdish.&#39; I wish &#39;Soapdish&#39; had more of a moment because I felt that that is a really strong, funny movie.

Then something is definitely beginning to go wrong.

I didn&#39;t plan out any huge career for myself.</p><p>I was going through a little bit of turbulence in my career. And so, it&#39;s funny how turbulence itself will make you hold onto something for security. And so the only thing I knew is trust in the Lord and lean not unto your own heart, in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path.</p><p>I actually feel like, for a lot of my career, I wasn&#39;t able to show my comedic range. I did a lot of dramas and dramedies. I was on &#39;E.R.&#39; That&#39;s not generally thought of as a funny show.</p><p>I have an older sister named Haley and she wanted to be an actress. So I wanted to be an actress. It&#39;s really funny the way that some people don&#39;t give kids enough credit for like really being driven, and really wanting to do things so badly.</p><p>If I&#39;m in something funny, I like to try and find some kind of serious line in it that people can relate to.</p><p>If you could cross a lion and a monkey, that&#39;s what I&#39;d be, because monkeys are funny and lions are strong.</p><p>I&#39;m good at coming up with wacky characters and funny dialogue.</p><p>Comedy clubs can be brutal. Those people are for real, and if you aren&#39;t funny, they aren&#39;t laughing. They don&#39;t care who you are.</p><p>Gotta stay in the gym, stay funny, stay sharp. I just love working.</p><p>I think it&#39;s actually a misperception that I am a comedic actress. I do more drama than comedy but very little of it has been seen. When you are in big funny movies and they do well and your little part in it kind of explodes people perceive you as a comedian.</p><p>I don&#39;t think of myself as a comedian, but as an artist, a scientist and chemist who just happens to be funny. I started doing stand-up to add another level to my game. I feel that I&#39;m a young rookie with a veteran&#39;s skill.</p><p>I feel cheesy when I see &#39;Silver Spoons.&#39; Some of it was funny, but some of it was just cheese!

I don&#39;t know if there needs to be another version of those shows.</p><p>I understand a woman who validates herself by getting attention from the opposite sex. I have a friend who is that to a T... Doesn&#39;t mean she isn&#39;t a good person. That&#39;s a funny character to play.</p><p>At school I was very shy. I wasn&#39;t funny really.</p><p>I love weird or funny or beautiful sentences Joy Williams could write a microwave-oven manual and I&#39;m sure I&#39;d love it, because the sentences would be tuned up like music.</p><p>I remember listening to the radio as a kid and finding that the songs always made me feel more peaceful. Funny, but the more hurtin&#39; the music was, the better it made me feel. I think of that now when I write my songs. I may not be feelin&#39; the blues myself, but I&#39;m writing them for other people who have a hard life.</p><p>What was funny if you were there is that we were all immensely sophisticated people who knew exactly what she was going to say and we&#39;re chatting away, nice to see you.</p><p>I&#39;m so unprofessional on set it&#39;s not even funny.</p><p>It&#39;s funny that it all becomes about clothes. It&#39;s bizarre. You work your butt off and then you win an award and it&#39;s all about your dress. You can&#39;t get away from it.</p><p>I follow the most random people on Twitter. I follow famous people like Khloe Kardashian, who surprisingly makes really funny tweets all the time.</p><p>I was not particularly bright, I wasn&#39;t very athletic, I was a little too tall, odd, funny looking, I was just really weird as a kid.</p><p>I think it&#39;s so funny when people think they can&#39;t control a movie star. They can. We&#39;re just women, you know.</p><p>I always approach comedy roles pretending they aren&#39;t funny.</p><p>I feel funny about owning art. I don&#39;t really want to say: &#39;Wow, come and see my Monet - it&#39;s in a dark room at the bottom of my cellar.&#39;</p><p>I love Mikhail Bulgakov. He is very original and takes the story to unexpected places. I didn&#39;t realise political writing could be so funny.</p><p>And there&#39;s a visceral fun in watching Team America and making it, like taking a puppet and throwing it against the wall. Because it&#39;s not CG, there&#39;s something funny about it.</p><p>So often, I read scripts and am like, &#39;This would never happen in real life. It&#39;s not trying to be funny. It&#39;s trying to be serious.&#39;</p><p>Acting is all about big hair and funny props... All the great actors knew it. Olivier knew it, Brando knew it.</p><p>Billy Crystal knows how to make people laugh. He&#39;s got 30 years on stage... there&#39;s no telling him what&#39;s funny.</p><p>I&#39;m not a believer in the pratfall. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s funny just to have someone fall down.</p><p>They did that little thing on South Park, and they mentioned my name and had a character of me judging a Halloween contest. It was really funny.That made me the coolest aunt on earth.</p><p>There&#39;s a constant flow of child actors. It&#39;s kind of funny to watch the new crew come through. I think, You poor little things. You&#39;re going to have to struggle for a long time.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, growing up there was never anybody around me with any kind of artistic bent.</p><p>When I was in college, I was in the theater department, which for anyone who has been involved in any kind of theater program, you know that it&#39;s really wacky and tight-knit, a real family. Me and my good friends from college would do random shows and plays that were sometimes serious, but most of the time really goofy and funny.</p><p>With Portlandia, I don&#39;t think our intention is always to find something funny. Sometimes the humor comes from taking something really seriously. We&#39;re okay with making somebody feel uncomfortable or uneasy.</p><p>I got to play with Nintendo&#39;s Wii, yes it&#39;s a funny name and not very revolutionary but it was fun whipping your arms around.</p><p>Jon Stewart hires people that he thinks are funny. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the only requirement.</p><p>It is possible in this world to be pretty and funny and successful all at the same time.</p><p>I think it&#39;s always funny when somebody thinks you&#39;re going to do something super sexy and then you don&#39;t.</p><p>Sometimes in the most tragic situation, something just profoundly funny happens.</p><p>And I think that being able to make people laugh and write a book that&#39;s funny makes the information go down a lot easier and it makes it a lot more fun to read, easier to understand, and often stronger. So there&#39;s all kinds of advantages to it.</p><p>It is funny what a year can do.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, in a way the actor is a writer. It&#39;s not like the two things are so separate as to be like apples and oranges. The writer and the actor are one.</p><p>Stealing, you&#39;ll go far in life. Actually, there is something funny about getting away with it.</p><p>Movies don&#39;t look hard, but figuring it out, getting the shape of it, getting everybody&#39;s character right and having it be funny, make sense and be romantic, it&#39;s creating a puzzle. Yes, having been a writer for so long, I have an awareness of when things are going awry, but it doesn&#39;t mean I know how to fix them.</p><p>I can do comedy, so people want me to do that, but the other side of comedy is depression. Deep, deep depression is the flip side of comedy. Casting agents don&#39;t realize it but in order to be funny you have to have that other side.</p><p>What&#39;s funny is my husband doesn&#39;t have any tattoos at all, so he must be the very conservative one.</p><p>I watched a lot of silent directors who were absolutely great like John Ford and Fritz Lang, Tod Browning, and also some very modern directors like The Coen Brothers. The directors take the freedom within their own movies to be melodramatic or funny when they chose to be. They do whatever they want and they don&#39;t care about the genre.</p><p>What I fell in love with as a child was &#39;My Fair Lady,&#39; &#39;Funny Face,&#39; &#39;American in Paris,&#39; and &#39;Singin&#39; in the Rain.&#39; Just perfect movies to me and I was dancing.

And I fell in love with those movies and fell in love with Audrey Hepburn and Leslie Caron.</p><p>My job is mostly to entertain and be funny.</p><p>Sometimes you have to take the focus off of you and put it on someone else and it&#39;s funny what you can accomplish and how much strength you really have.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I was funny until college. I lived with some Harvard MD/PhD students - they were so smart, and what I contributed to the house was, I was the funny one.</p><p>When I was younger I wanted to be a big movie star who&#39;d get to be funny on talk shows and then I wanted to retire and write science fiction.</p><p>When you are not treated seriously, you develop comically. Its sense of oneself is so fractured and fragile that it&#39;s like the picked-on kid who has to become funny.</p><p>I got pregnant at 40 by surprise. It&#39;s funny, because when we found out we were pregnant, I said, &#39;Okay, let&#39;s experience that.&#39; You just have to just go with it because it&#39;s rare.</p><p>Billy is a funny, cheeky, lovely boy and I love being with him. Parenthood is terrifying though. I can barely walk past a building without panicking that it&#39;s going to collapse on his head.</p><p>The funny thing is the songs that people think are about me probably aren&#39;t. And the songs that are probably are the ones they wouldn&#39;t think... so that&#39;s where it kind of is funny.</p><p>Funny, I don&#39;t feel any more powerful today than yesterday.</p><p>The Islam of the 18th, 19th and first half of the 20th century was a poor thing. Nobody bothered about it. Islam was that funny sort of pure system of beliefs that depressed people in the Middle East held as their religion.</p><p>Most of my ideas just come out funny.</p><p>Sometimes laughing isn&#39;t the best judge of what&#39;s funny, &#39;cause I think there&#39;s a lot of things that are really funny that don&#39;t make you laugh, that don&#39;t make you physically, audibly make a noise, but is something that is much more powerful than that.</p><p>There is nothing funny about a well-adjusted, intelligent person making the right choices.</p><p>I&#39;m always in situations where you can&#39;t be funny, and yet I want to do it anyway.</p><p>It&#39;s a funny thing about me. I don&#39;t have any interest in food most of the time now, although when I was a kid I was always hungry.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t even 20 at the time, but it taught me something about drugs. They can take a good man, a warm, funny, loving family man, and turn him into a loser and worse.</p><p>I believe, in a funny way, the job of the novelist is to be out there on the fringes and speaking for an experience that has not really been spoken for.</p><p>Funny, how moms can tell you what to do no matter how old or big you are.</p><p>I didn&#39;t grow up identifying with beauty. I grew up thinking I could be smart and funny - those are the things I got feedback on.</p><p>Inappropriateness is funny to me. Rudeness is hilarious.</p><p>I think if they put a laugh track on &#39;Intervention,&#39; it would be funny.</p><p>We all know how funny Morrissey is. Actually, you know what? I say that sarcastically. His songs are some of the funniest songs I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. I mean, really. I mean, not that the &#39;Girlfriend in a Coma&#39; is, like, really funny.</p><p>When I was in high school I used to sit by myself in the cafeteria - not necessarily by choice - but I thought it was funny to talk to people that weren&#39;t there.</p><p>Laughter is involuntary. If it&#39;s funny you laugh.</p><p>What&#39;s funny about that is when I was writing Twilight just for myself and not thinking of it as a book, I was not thinking about publishing, and yet at the same time I was casting it in my head. Because when I read books, I see them very visually.</p><p>I auditioned for a solo in church and got it. I was about seven and I sang a song called, &#39;Jesus, I Heard You Had a Big House&#39; and I remember people standing up at the end and me thinking, &#39;Oh, I think I&#39;m going to like this.&#39; That&#39;s how it all began. Sounds funny to say you got your start in church, but I did.</p><p>It&#39;s so different when you change your hair color, you&#39;re treated so differently. It&#39;s a very funny experience. It&#39;s fun - I love changing up my hair.</p><p>I&#39;m a big fan of certain new acts. I love any genre of music, and I think it&#39;s really great to see that there are new artists coming through. It&#39;s kinda funny to think that I&#39;m like the old man on campus now. But I&#39;m really happy for groups like One Direction. I think they&#39;re really good guys.</p><p>When I turned about 12 or 13, I realised that being funny wasn&#39;t about remembering jokes. It was about creating them.</p><p>They&#39;re great girls. They&#39;re very funny, they&#39;re very smart, they&#39;re fun to be with. They&#39;re very lively, as I think people can tell. And you know, they&#39;re very confident girls.</p><p>And regardless of the fact that in this country, certainly in the arts, we treat comedy as a second-class citizen, I&#39;ve never thought of it that way. I&#39;ve always thought it to be important. The last time I looked, the Greeks were holding up two masks. I&#39;ve always thought of it not only as having equal value, but as the craft of it, being funny.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, but we were living on this small island off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina when I was 9.</p><p>I have no agenda except to be funny. Neither I or the writers profess to offer any worldly wisdom.</p><p>In my experience, it&#39;s not just that serious books get a hearing on comedy shows. But serious books get a serious hearing, as well as a funny one, on comedy shows.</p><p>It&#39;s a bit like school camp, shooting a film. Everyone&#39;s on heat. It&#39;s a strange energy. It&#39;s full of adrenalin. I funnel my excess energy in funny little ways. I do a lot of dancing in my trailer. I love music.</p><p>Here&#39;s the funny thing about the response I&#39;ve been aware of to my dating famous people: It&#39;s been very negative. I&#39;m either not good-looking enough, not a good enough actor or not successful enough for these people.</p><p>I like the hot-cold, the sugar-salt, being able to play over-the-top and dramatic things - in the same film. Just as in my life, I can be very funny and at other times almost extinguished.</p><p>I&#39;m an off-road racecar driver. And I think every woman in my life has told me that&#39;s not a sensible hobby. But when I was growing, even more than I wanted to be funny, I wanted to be a racecar driver. That&#39;s all I thought about. I worked for a race team when I was 15 and I traveled with them.</p><p>Kyle Baker&#39;s work is really funny, but it&#39;s also got a very clear vision.</p><p>It&#39;s funny: I&#39;ve been very successful and done a lot of films, and I don&#39;t really have an agent - I don&#39;t really pursue jobs, I let people come to me.</p><p>If you look at the game and everything, it&#39;s not quite like looking at an animated film, because that&#39;s total character. This, this is really movement, but it&#39;s got funny little things if you look for the humor. They&#39;re actually getting to the character.</p><p>It&#39;s a funny thing because you look at the careers of other filmmakers, and you see them sort of slow down, and you realize, maybe this becomes harder to do as you get older. That&#39;s sort of a cautionary thing. I hope it doesn&#39;t happen to me.</p><p>There&#39;s a darkness under &#39;The Hangover&#39; because ultimately there&#39;s a missing person and it&#39;s not really that funny. There&#39;s a sort of darkness under it that I love, and still people are laughing as hard if not harder than they did in &#39;Old School.&#39;</p><p>I think people like comedies and I think concept driven comedies seem to be working when it&#39;s a clear concept and you deliver funny stuff.</p><p>Now that I&#39;m more mature, in a funny way, I can even appreciate that I&#39;ve bad to become more aware of my body. Since I&#39;ve chosen acting as my career, I have to keep my weight down anyway-I&#39;ve been used to it for years, so it&#39;s no problem. And there&#39;s nothing I can&#39;t do.</p><p>Comedy is so subjective. You could be in a room with 400 people laughing at a joke and you could just not think it&#39;s funny. You&#39;re just sitting there like, &#39;Am I in the twilight zone? Why is everyone laughing?&#39; It&#39;s such a personal thing. People have such a personal visceral response to comedy.</p><p>I would do it today because the thing that appealed to me was not necessarily the mechanics of the robot, but it was his personality and how funny and charming he was.</p><p>You know, if I started worrying about what the critics think, I&#39;d never make another comedy. You couldn&#39;t pick a less funny group than critics - you couldn&#39;t find a more bitter group of people!</p><p>When I was a kid I had this funny blonde hair and everyone called me &#39;Chick&#39; because I looked like Tweety Bird.</p><p>I think that &#39;Hangover II&#39; is as funny as &#39;The Hangover I,&#39; honest to God, but I think that it&#39;s a little bit darker, and the stakes are a little bit higher.</p><p>I don&#39;t think know if anything&#39;s going to translate anywhere. You&#39;re making a movie, you hope it&#39;s going to be funny, you can&#39;t think about how it&#39;s going to go over.</p><p>If you can find the line between sympathetic and creepy, you have reached a very funny area.</p><p>I don&#39;t think the public is dying to see me necessarily be funny all the time.</p><p>I love New York. I was sad, depressed and incredibly moved by our fellow countrymen and what they&#39;ve done. I wanted to give people a chance to see something funny, have a distraction.</p><p>Jim Carrey, a comic genius, has a harder time overcoming the public&#39;s desire for him to be funny simply because he&#39;s so good at it.</p><p>If you take a bunch of superstars and put them in a room where they don&#39;t have their assistants and entourage, it&#39;s funny to see what happens.</p><p>Because death and illness are the most horrible things in life, of course that&#39;s where the most absurdly funny things are going to happen.</p><p>I think one of the basic tasks in life - one of the nice things we can do for each other - is to take things that are horrible and scary and make them acceptable and less frightening and, if possible, funny. It feels great to succeed at that.</p><p>I appreciate humor so much, but I&#39;m actually not a funny girl.</p><p>During the Great Depression, when people laughed their worries disappeared. Audiences loved these funny men. I decided to become one.</p><p>I remember interviewing someone I actually felt bad for, and therefore didn&#39;t want to take an ironic stance against him. It actually turned out to be a really funny piece.</p><p>I don&#39;t think my judgment is that good. I don&#39;t know what is funny.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, the hardest thing to do is to make something look like it&#39;s fast, loose and improvised, and get somebody to laugh.</p><p>Sometimes we have to actually say, I think you&#39;re really funny, but none of your jokes are going to make it on the air. So just answer my questions. Seriously.</p><p>I&#39;m not a comedian. I&#39;m an actor who just happens to be funny on occasion.</p><p>The prospects for a coherent, hilarious and consistent American comedy seem to lessen every year, as the poor waterlogged, gassy corpse called &#39;Evan Almighty&#39; proved when it floated ashore recently. So there&#39;s a temptation to think too highly of Robin Williams&#39;s uneven but occasionally funny &#39;License to Wed.&#39;</p><p>Lucky&#39; is for laughs, and there&#39;s really nothing funny that I&#39;m doing on &#39;Dexter.&#39; I think more than anything, both comment on the fact that anybody is capable of anything. Just because they are the shy guy in the corner doesn&#39;t mean that they are a harmless little bunny.;Colin Hanks;funny 26607;There have been times when I felt suicidal and I would stop my head from going in that direction of negativity because I thought there&#39;d be something I&#39;d miss that was funny in the future.

She is everything - funny, attractive, hard-working, she has integrity, she loves me to bits.;Seal;funny 26613;A film that I love is &#39;Raising Arizona&#39; and that&#39;s funny but it&#39;s quite indie and weird and odd and quirky. I&#39;d love to do something like that. Who knows?;Stephen Moyer;funny 26614;And of course Marc Cherry heightens it and makes it hilarious. But there&#39;s so many universal themes in the show, and he made it so funny. We knew he was onto something if he could keep it up and, thankfully, he did.;James Denton;funny 26615;It&#39;s so funny when you&#39;re actually directing because things start popping that you don&#39;t expect to pop, and something that you think is going to pop, maybe doesn&#39;t quite have the impetus that you thought it might.;Stephen Moyer;funny 26616;Well, I&#39;m not afraid to say something if I think it&#39;s funny, even if it&#39;s harsh or racist.;Sarah Silverman;funny 26617;The promos with all of the beautiful women probably attracted some men, but the mystery story line is pretty cool. It&#39;s got that dark edge, and people will watch anything funny.;James Denton;funny 26618;But I think you can make fun of anything as long as it&#39;s funny enough.;Sarah Silverman;funny 26619;It&#39;s funny, because &#39;1600 Penn&#39; was the first time I really started to read the reviews, because I am an executive producer and I wanted to see what people were enjoying and not enjoying as a means to an end, right?;Josh Gad;funny 26620;I mean, I talk about being Jewish a lot. It&#39;s funny because I do think of myself as Jewish ethnically, but I&#39;m not religious at all. I have no religion.;Sarah Silverman;funny 26621;It&#39;s funny because &#39;The Book of Mormon&#39; is &#39;The Book of Mormon&#39; now. When I was doing it at the very beginning, and I was a part of it for four years and always believed in it, I never really knew if it was going to be more than a convention for &#39;South Park&#39; fans.;Josh Gad;funny 26622;I know people will think it&#39;s funny because I&#39;ve done glamour modelling in the past, but I felt embarrassed about my body and just wanted to cover it up.;Jennifer Ellison;funny 26623;I got the wake-up call that no one is policing our oceans. I wondered, how can I do anything? What really can I do to make things better? There are some perks to being a celebrity. My job is to be funny once in a while, but it&#39;s my responsibility to make good use of it.;Angela Kinsey;funny 26624;My parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles were all funny, and I felt that energy, that delivery, that timing, that sarcasm. All that stuff seeped into my brain.;Jeff Ross;funny 26625;Wikipedia is just an incredible thing.

If it doesn&#39;t offend somebody it&#39;s probably not a joke. It&#39;s probably an observation that&#39;s not funny.

He is smart, funny, and interesting.;Tucker Carlson;funny 26629;I&#39;ve actually tried to roast somebody that I don&#39;t like, and it doesn&#39;t go well.

I don&#39;t know where this loud, ballsy, hammy ridiculousness came from. I&#39;m just glad I followed my goals and my parents did too. It&#39;s not like we even had a plan when I dragged my mom to Los Angeles.;Emma Stone;funny 26631;It&#39;s funny, though, because when I first started going to races after we met, I was extremely nervous. It&#39;s like being backstage and hoping you don&#39;t trip over something or break an amp or accidentally speak into a live microphone, so I was really hesitant.;Ashley Judd;funny 26632;People are funny, and in the most tragic situations, when comedy erupts from nowhere, it can turn on its head within the space of a second or a minute.

In any hour you can choose to liberate the future.</p><p>Why not invest in the future of music, instead of building fortresses to preserve its past?</p><p>You have to like the present if not your life becomes secondhand, if you think it was better before. Or that it will be better in the future.</p><p>The future is built on brains, not prom court, as most people can tell you after attending their high school reunion. But you&#39;d never know it by talking to kids or listening to the messages they get from the culture and even from their schools.</p><p>My philosophy is to take one day at a time. I don&#39;t worry about the future. Tomorrow is even out of sight for me.</p><p>As more people use social media to tell the story of the future, the wants and needs of more people will be reflected.</p><p>In fact, I believe the first companies that make an effort to develop an authentic, transparent, and meaningful social contract with their fans and customers will turn out to be the ones that are the most successful in the future. While brands that refuse to make the effort will lose stature and customer loyalty.</p><p>The future is today.</p><p>I have never been able to grasp the meaning of time. I don&#39;t believe it exists. I&#39;ve felt this again and again, when alone and out in nature. On such occasions, time does not exist. Nor does the future exist.</p><p>The next few months are critical to Pakistan&#39;s future direction as a democratic state committed to promoting peace, fighting terrorism and working for social justice.</p><p>Our imagination is the only limit to what we can hope to have in the future.</p><p>We in the United States should be all the more thankful for the freedom and religious tolerance we enjoy. And we should always remember the lessons learned from the Holocaust, in hopes we stay vigilant against such inhumanity now and in the future.</p><p>If we can&#39;t begin to agree on fundamentals, such as the elimination of the most abusive forms of child labor, then we really are not ready to march forward into the future.</p><p>Our modern states are preparing for war without even knowing the future enemy.</p><p>I don&#39;t just want a better deal for Britain. I want a better deal for Europe too. So I speak as British prime minister with a positive vision for the future of the European Union. A future in which Britain wants, and should want, to play a committed and active part.</p><p>If Jesus Christ was who He claimed to be, and He did die on a cross at a point of time in history, then, for all history past and all history future it is relevant because that is the very focal point for forgiveness and redemption.</p><p>Our work is before us. It cannot be passed to future legislatures and must not be passed to future generations. May we boldly seize the moment with singular unity. And may we build a Texas of unlimited possibility.</p><p>The foundation for future prosperity is built on the bedrock of good jobs and great schools. We are building a strong foundation one job at a time and one educated Texan at a time.</p><p>I think life is far too short to concentrate on your past. I rather look into the future.</p><p>Run to meet the future or it&#39;s going to run you down.</p><p>The problem is that borrowing money to pay back more borrowed money that will oblige you in the future to borrow even more money doesn&#39;t sound kosher.
