logan was studying with me meaning he wanted to know certain things and i needed an alto player so he played all of my concerts and occasionally i would let him have some of his things played in the

ensemble like giuseppi he held his head back all the way explaining once this way my throat is completely open so he could have more air coming through his windpipe he used to pride himself on playing up to the fourth octave on alto the things that made him different as an improvisor were the way he placed his notes that sound he got and then what the others in his group played behind him his pieces were very attractive for those reasons giuseppi had his own points of view about music which is what this music is supposed to be about we got alongespdisks bernard stollman on logangiuseppi was doing an awful lot of drugshe burned out well actually he flipped out and never came back i think that helps explain what happened to giuseppi also he was mentally ill to some degree and he

absorbed we hadnt been paying attention i thought oh god this remarkable thing is lost it was interrupted in the middle and its gone richard alderson was the engineer and he got on the intercom and said giuseppi the tape ran out without a pause giuseppi said take it back to before where it stopped and well take it from there so he did he wound it back and played some bars of it and took down the

the new york art quartet he wanted to record me and in turn i told giuseppi that i have some time because im a young guy and instead of me taking this record date and being the leader i gave him the

new guinea studies by larrakin records pty ltd nsw australiablasius to una turtavu was born on february 2nd 1925 at paparatawa village in the kokopo subprovince of east new britain only two months after he was born his mother died and his father a catholic priest took him to vunapope convent so blasius was brought up by the sisters in 1933 they sent him to milmila catholic mission in the duke of york islands and he attended primary school there until 1938 then he returned to vunapope and lived with his father until 1941 he was in vunapope when the japanese army invaded new britain and in 1942 he was unwillingly recruited by the japanese as an interpreter during this time he had to teach japanese soldiers melanesian pidgin and kuanua the tolai language and he learned some japanese which he still recalls today towards the end of the war suspected of sympathy towards the allied american and australian armies he was jailed and condemned to death by the japanese but was eventually freed by an american pilot blasius was very happy when the war ended and after a few months as a patient because of an injured leg he started working at the nonga military hospital and became a doctors driver in 1947 since then he has always retained the same occupation and is today working with the department of transport in rabaulblasius to una first picked up a guitar in 1946 he borrowed it from a brother in law for 5 shillings at this time his salary was very low and he could not afford to buy his own instrument nevertheless later in the year he managed to buy himself a ukulele and started his musical career his first composition in 1949 was a series of four hymns one of which aura turangan i nodup is included in this record side one track five then he composed regularly not only hymns but also high masses ballads in his own kuanua tongue and humorous and satyrical songs in pidgin blasius to una is very popular in the gazelle peninsula and also all over papua new guinea particularly amongst pidgin speakers he has been a regular participant of the tolai warwagira festival held annually in rabaul and he took part in the port moresby arts festival in 1974 he has also performed at numerous social occasions in his home province although blasius is frequently heard on the radio it is the first time that an lp record of his work is being published blasius to una is a complete musician he composes both the music and lyrics of his songs he sings and he plays the guitaron this record he is backed by three of his sons hironimus antonius and ludovicus blasius to una finds his inspiration in a lot of different areas he can sing about the sun or the moon about his country and his people about love about death or about his favourite vegetable his music is popular and blasius is very concerned about the impact his poetry has on the public blasius imagination and ingenuity are fully recognised amongst the tolai people of east new britain and he is often commissioned to compose songs for a particular occasion or purpose his two latest songs were both commissioned a umana beo was written for the women of the kabaira vocational centre to perform at the 1976 warwagira festival in rabaul and blasius most recent composition iau lus man takodo side two track seven was written on june 15th 1977 for a leader of the village of nodup where blasius now lives although blasius to unas music obviously owes very little to the tolai musical traditions it is interesting to note that he has not found himself completely isolated from their traditional musical organisation individuals and community groups sometimes commission songs from him for quite traditional occasions some people now even prefer his style to more orthodox tolai music this record attempts to show the different faces of blasius to una turtavus creativity through the 28 years of his musicallife humorous and satyrical songs in pidgin like fopela lek side one track four or kunai dumdum side two track three ballads in his own kuanua tongue like iau abul ramalmal side two track four or amari na ra vian side one track two and in english like lonely evening side two track six blasius to una might make you feel sad but in the next song he will cheer you up and really make you laugh at fifty three blasius is still full of energy and very much in love with music maybe that is

classified information to israel while working as a civilian intelligence analyst he was sentenced to life in prison but because his offenses were committed prior to november 1987 he could become eligible for parole as early as november 2015pollard is the only american ever to receive a life sentence for passing classified information to an ally of the us israeli officials american and israeli activist groups and american politicians who see his punishment as unfair have lobbied continuously for reduction or commutation of his sentence the israeli government issued a formal apology to the us in 1987 for its role in pollards espionage since then it has made repeated attempts through both official and unofficial channels to negotiate his release israel granted pollard citizenship in 1995 but did not publicly admit buying classified information from him until 1998 pollards rabbi has written that pollard expressed regret for his actions and argues that he was never charged with treason which is only applicable technically in cases that involve an enemy statein contrast there is considerable ongoing resistance to any form of clemency from numerous officials familiar with the case including former cia director george tenet multiple former us secretaries of defense a bipartisan group of us congressional leaders and members of the american intelligence community opponents maintain that the damage to american national security as a result of pollards activities was far more severe and enduring than publicly acknowledged intelligence officials contend that at least some of the information purchased from pollard ended up in the soviet union his motives they argue were monetary not idealistic or patriotic he stole classified documents related to china that his wife used to advance her personal business interests he admitted shopping his services to countries other than israel there is evidence that he sold classified information to south africa and attempted to do so with pakistan he also attempted to broker arms deals with south africa argentina taiwan pakistan and iranpollards case was later compared to that of benami kadish another us citizen who pled guilty to charges of passing classified information to israel during the same period"},{"author":"Kousuke Akiyoshi","quote":"kousuke akiyoshi akiyoshi ksuke born january 12 1975 is a motorcycle road

student at the cristbal roja school of plastic arts in caracas from which he graduated in 1972in 1976 after a second solo exhibition at the contemporary art museum of caracas milton becerra made a series of interventions in the landscapemilton becerras first works appeared during the 1970s within this context these works are located in diverse suburban areas of caracas in the imprecise boundaries that separate the metropolis the forest or the pastures high up in the banks of streams or in the last streets and rows of houses of the city at colonia tovar or at la mariposa dam although it is strictly a matter of actions and interventions these pieces end up being a series of photographs which more than a document constitute an initial artistic and poetic approximation to that vision of nature and the territory as sacred spaces conducive to mystical experiences and intersected by a memory of cultures of peoples who have been silenced or have disappeared this starting point will later characterize very profoundly the body of his workthese first interventions act as experiments through which milton becerra attempts to establish a critical rereading of the ways in which the geometric and kinetic traditions predominant in venezuelan art during those years manifest themselves this occurs when the interventions incorporate gestures laden with subjectivity or with signs into nature that show an imperfect geometry that adapts to the forms of the stones or the terrain later on the artist will adopt in his interventions the graphic style of the original native cultures reintroducing or inventing forms creating a sign alphabet that evokes a memory and a history from a geometric vision where irregularity will turn into a form of expression that will allow new generations of forms to come into existence based on those already carried outin 1973 he executed numerous drawings and works on paper in which woven lines create graphic screens of very precise geometric shapes but where irregularities also produce movement and evolve towards other new structures these pieces combined together under the name hexagonometras form a body of ideas that although originating from the venezuelan normative and geometric pictorial tradition dissociate from it little by little and in a certain sense negate it in its principles to the extent in which order evolves into irregularity it is possible to discern in these early works the spirit of some subsequent trends in his body of work like nets and drawings made of vegetable fibers and cords which are connected metaphorically to the handicrafts of native peoples from the venezuelan provinces these works take on certain spiritual and cosmogonic connotations that relate to the principles work in spite of the distance as if the irregularities created a resistance to the normative traditionit must be pointed out that for artists of milton becerras generation the importance of the geometric and kinetic tradition in venezuelan art holds the significance of being a starting point with which one may argue but with which one shares a depiction of radicalism and modernitymilton becerras options with regards to materials anthropology and poetry do not renounce this geometric legacy but rather reinterprets it based on a memory of the ancestral in this artistic context it is a decision that emphasizes the perspective of identity with the objective of carrying out a contextual inclusionthe conceptual proposal milton becerra moving towards experimenting with new languages and was hailed during his participation at the xith international biennale of young artists at the museum of modern art in paris in 1980in 1992 milton becerra showed a new dichotomy between life and death when he participates in the arte amazonas project organized by the goethe institute of brazil on the occasion of the united nations conference on the environment and development eco92 his work focused on the

economy milton becerra explained as he talked about this exhibition a societys four structural powers are therein contained powers that restrain the maximum power the scepter represents military power and is one of the exhibitions major symbols money as the supreme symbol of power in western societies helped becerra to situate and enrich his proposition on aesthetic connotations the dollar or the bolivar seen as money in the form of coins or paper money served as a symbol of the loss of identity suffered by venezuelans allowing the artist to reach the transcendence of a work of art ie in relation to life and the problems of the environment becerras works using money as a focal theme started in the 70shis work is included in various international private collections"},{"author":"Anwar

master born in south korea he is a disciple of ku san sunim and entered songgwangsa buddhist monastery in 1966 from 19661969 he studied in the sutra hall of songgwangsa studying buddhist sutras and philosophy in 1970 he began his studies of zen philosophy and zen meditation after ten years of training in zen meditation halls he felt that the traditional zen hall training was not helping his practice he then lived for three years as a wandering beggar begging for his food and places to sleep this gave him the opportunity to let go of everything he was holding on to it was during this period that he finally realized what correct zen practice really is and felt that he was ready to study under a great master he then went to master jeon gang sunim in yonghwasa temple in incheon south korea and began studying under himat this point he began living in small remote mountain hermitages doing intensive zen practice during this time he heard about a taoist hermit who was teaching a qigong breathing practice called kuk sundo he began training under taoist master chung san in 1972 and in 1982 was sanctioned as a taoist master master sunim spent six years in rigorous practice alone in hermitages in remote mountain areas where he followed a raw food diet eating what the mountains made availablehowever from the time he lived and practice in zen meditation halls master sunim experienced health difficulties which no medical doctor or chinese herbalist was able to alleviate his lay supporters would bring him expensive ginseng to help give him more energy and strength but this just worsened his condition and over time he became continually weaker finally he met an acupuncturistherbalist who told him that he had a lesser yang constitution and gave him an herbal formula to take master sunim described the results of this formula as suddenly turning his health around 180 degrees he was astounded at how much better he felt and began to inquire about the system of medicine the herbalist was using he was told this was traditional korean sasang constitutional medicine master sunim immediately decided he was going to study this medical system he felt that it was important that he learn to take care of his own health since so many doctors had been unable to help him during his years of practicing in hermitages he also studied sasang constitutional medicine scm under two renowned acupuncturistherbalists one of them was so impressed with sunims diligence and special skills in quickly understanding the principles of scm that when he retired from his practice he gave all his journals and notes to sunim for his own referencein 1985 he was invited by hae heng a french monk who had studied in songgwangsa to become the spiritual director of the buddhayana vihara zen center in geneva switzerland master sunim held this position from 19851986 his experience in switzerland made him realize that given his limited english and french skills he needed a way to better understand his students and the personal problems about which they would seek his advice upon returning to south korea in early 1986 he began to study the system of five element natal charts under a famous practitioner in the city of gwangju cholla namdo these natal charts gave him some insight into the personality of the individual and deepened his understanding of five element principles which he had studied in scmin the early summer of 1986 master sunim accompanied by jaguang sunim a canadian buddhist nun who also trained in songgwangsa as his translator traveled to vancouver bc canada where he established a zen and sundo center here he continued his own zen practice as well as continuing his studies of scm herbology and five element natal charts one day while contemplating a natal chart it suddenly occurred to him that the five elements visible in an individuals natal chart could provide a map indicating their body constitution in the scm system the most difficult part the weakest link of the korean scm system was the actual determination of a persons body constitution traditionally they had used various markers such as the physical shape of the body pulse blood type personality emotions etc to try and determine the body constitution but these had always proved to be somewhat inaccurate sunim decided to test his theory that the five element natal charts could point to the individuals body constitution with much more accuracy in scm herbology there is a broad set of many different formulas for each constitution as long as the practitioner has correctly determined the constitution of the patient then the herbal formulas for that constitution will all fundamentally agree with them and cause no irreversible harm the healing energies of the herbs all fall into one of the five elements so if the herbal formula was a combination of five elements that was compatible with the five element makeup of the patients internal organsenergies then in theory they would experience a beneficial response to the herbal formula through this system of testing matching the five element natal chart with the five element energies of the herbal formulas master sunim discovered that the natal charts did indeed provide an extremely accurate picture of the internal energy condition of the patient and therefore showing the patients body constitution he continued to investigate and use these two systems over the next 20 yearsone early spring day while sitting in the zen hall suddenly all his doubts were resolved and he wrote the following song of enlightenment even existing dharmas must be discarded so how can we cling to dharmas which dont exist ah ha futilely the ancients busily pursued enlightenment then departed the countenance existing of its own accord i wonder who named it buddha or sentient being even one true dharma cannot survive outside the window the cherry tree is singing this news he is currently head abbot of temples on two
