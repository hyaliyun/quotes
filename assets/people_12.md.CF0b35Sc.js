islamic legal studies his work has been translated into several languages including arabic hebrew indonesian italian japanese korean persian and turkish in 2009 and despite his nonmuslim background hallaq was named among the 500 most influential muslims in the world his recent work explores the paradigmatic structures of islamic political and ethical thought which he uses as a foundation for a thorough critique of modern ethicopolitical paradigms that he argues are dominant since the enlightenment the impossible state islam politics and modernitys moral predicament columbia university press 2012hallaqs publications lectures and course offerings reveal several dominant areas of interest and expertise primary among these have been 1 a concern with the markedly problematic yet often overlooked epistemic institutional ruptures generated by the onset of modernity and the many sociopoliticohistorical forces subsumed by it including colonialism and its many projects especially in the overlapping areas of law and morality 2 a related concern with intellectual history and the development of orientalism and the many repercussions of orientalist paradigms in later scholarship and in islamic legal studies as a whole and 3 a thorough explication of the synchronic and diachronic development of islamic traditions of logic legal theory and substantive law along with an elucidation of the particulars of interdependent systems within these traditions hallaqs writings have laid bare the structural dynamics of legal change in premodern law and have more recently asserted the central role of moral theory for understanding the history of islamic law his most exhaustive work to date sharia theory practice transformations 2009 has been wellreceived and represents a pioneering attempt at introducing theory into the field of islamic legal studiessuch concerns are brought to the fore however in hallaqs most recent work the impossible state islam politics and modernitys moral predicament columbia university press 2012 which has been described by a publisher as followswael b hallaq boldly argues that the islamic state judged by anystandard definition of what the modern state represents is both animpossible and inherently selfcontradictory concept comparing the legalpolitical moral and constitutional histories of premodern islam andeuroamerica he finds the adoption and practice of the modern state to behighly problematic for modern muslims he then conducts a more expansivecritique of modernitys moral predicament which renders impossible anyproject resting solely on ethical foundationsthe modern state not onlysuffers from serious legal political and constitutional problems hallaqargues but it also by its very nature fashions a subject inconsistentwith what it means to be or to live as a muslim by islamic standards thestates technologies of the self are severely lacking in moral substanceand the muslim state as hallaq shows has done little to advance anacceptable form of genuine sharia governance hallaq turns to the richmoral resources of islamic history along the way showing that political andother crises of islam are not unique to the islamic world nor to themuslim religion these crises are integral to the modern condition of botheast and west and recognizing such parallels enables muslims to engage moreproductively with their western counterpartshallaqs interests and activities also extend into the world of art in the past two decades he has produced numerous paintings and drawings a selection of which may be viewed at pinterestcom all of these works appear to combine aesthetics with notions of moral and existential philosophies with regard to the former a strong interest in cubism and surrealism is evident most apparent in terms of philosophiesand perhaps at the very heart of hallaqs work artistic and academicis a penetrative exploration of the antinomy of the modern human condition with all the paradoxes

where she joined and eventually became president of both the local chapters of the league of women voters and the junior league then when their children were old enough to attend school she took a job at a downtown bank a position that expanded her contacts amongst the citys power brokersin 1985 chapin was selected by the orlando regional chamber of commerce to head their project 2000 an effort to set millennial goals for the city in the areas of economic development the arts and transportation as this project came to an end her districts incumbent county commissioner retired and she ran a successful campaign to win his open seatas a new county commissioner chapin is credited with pushing for modernization of the county charter this was done in 1988 and included the creation of a new position chairman of the orange county commission to be elected by a countywide vote rather than being selected from the commissioners representing single member districts two years later in 1990 she was elected the first person to fill that position buoyed in part by her leading role in getting the walt disney company to work with the countys housing finance authority to buy back bonds and provide mortgage assistance to lowermiddleincome familiesdisillusioned with the job by 1994 she announced her decision not to seek reelection and encouraged state senator toni jennings to run to succeed her but jennings chose to remain in tallahassee eventually becoming lieutenant governor under jeb bush this left two rival commissioners to compete for the job the conservative tom dorman and the liberal fran pignone so chapin relented and launched a reelection campaign to regain the support of the thenpolarized electorate she overwhelmingly won a runoff against pignone 61 to 39chapins time as orange county chairman coincided with the administration of glenda hood as mayor of orlando a time when feminine influence over local politics was at an alltime high the two women along with jennings and dianna fuller morgan walt disney worlds senior vice president for community and government relations were recognized as the leaders of the local old girl network they formed closed friendships despite surface political differences and even took annual christmas shopping trips to new york city togetheron june 25 1996 chapin led the orange county commission in approving a 53 million subsidy to build a fourth interchange for walt disney world on interstate 4 this spending would later spark a public outcry when it was revealed the construction project was not even in orange county but across the line in osceola county chapin justified the subsidy however by pointing out disneys billion dollar investment in constructing its animal kingdom theme park as well as the coronado springs and boardwalk resortsall of which would generate tax dollars for orange countyas her second term drew to a close in 1998 chapin again did not want to run for reelection instead she was succeeded by future hud secretary and us senator mel martinez and she was tapped by buddy mackay who was acting as governor of florida since the death of lawton chiles to complete the unexpired term of fran carlton who had recently resigned as orange county clerk of the courts chapin enjoyed the clerks job even less than the county chairmanship because it was more administrative and less policydrivenit came as no surprise in 2000 when local congressman bill mccollum announced his candidacy to succeed connie mack in the us senate that chapin jumped at the chance to claim his open seat in the house of representatives as a democrat candidate she quickly raised over 1 million in campaign contributions more than the combined funds raised by the three republicans who also announced their candidacies that year moderate state legislator bill sublette conservative attorney ric keller and military veteran bob heringchapin would go on to face keller in the general election that november the campaign gained considerable national attention as the more politically experienced chapin seemed capable of taking the seat away from the republican majority in congress but the 8th congressional district of florida is historically conservative and chapins long career in public service provided easy fodder for the keller campaign they successfully painted her as a liberal opponent of the right to bear arms but more famously cited her spending 18500 in county funds for a bronze sculpture of a frog to back up their claim of her fiscal irresponsibility these tactics allowed keller to eke out a 51 to 49 win over chapinsince leaving elective office chapin has continued to hold considerable influence over public policy in the orlando area as director of the metropolitan center for regional studies at the university of central florida most notably in 2007 she headed orange countys task force on ethics and campaign finance reform and recommended among

implementation has commenced in the us healthcare system community rating systems will be the basis for health care premiums in the future exchange system these ratings pool people in to demographic groups and charge all members a constant rate the goal of this system is to prevent medical underwriting and decrease the inequities that occur for clients with higher risks of increased medical utilization present in a risk adjusted system goldman et al conducted a study in california that trialed such clusters of insured clients by pooling at the state level regional level and metropolitan level results from californias experiment with such a system conclude that the larger the areas pooled the greater the transfer of costsanother challenge to community based rating systems is that

not be the only place where community rating systems are utilized centers for medicare and medicaid services cms cms plans to initiate a modified rating system starting in january 2014 this may lead other insurance companies following suitdue to the results of the california experiment and the widespread use of community based rating systems being initiated it is imperative that some kind of

was going to win and thats how i feel about this one i have been so excited for it so selfishly im upset that i cant fight this pregnancy definitely caught me by surprise and i thought i had passed

her epoca primitiva which roughly translates to primitive period which began after she participated in a clay modeling course sponsored by the french embassy in san salvador 19671968 where she made casts and polychrome pourings using many techniques including encaustics which she would later use in paintings combined with other contemporary techniques and materials it was during this time that ana maria inspired by mayan and colonial art began the search for a style of her own where she could begin to express her message of spiritual peace and the joy of living she focuses on regional
