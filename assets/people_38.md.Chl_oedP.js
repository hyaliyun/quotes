north jeolla is a politician and was the united new democratic party candidate for president of south korea in 2007from april 2004 until december 2005 chung was the south korean minister of unification before holding that post he served two terms in the national assembly with the national congress for new politics and the millennium democratic party respectively has twice been chairman of the uri party and was considered a strong contender to succeed roh moohyun as president like roh chung is also a roman catholiche has a bachelors degree in korean history from seoul national university 1979 and masters from the university of wales and before entering politics he was a journalist and anchor at the politics section of the munhwa broadcasting corporationduring his tenure as unification minister chung was a strong supporter of the sunshine policy one of his uncontroversial achievements is the foundation of kaesong industrial complex which is an exclusive industrial zone set up on the southernmost province of north korea keasong the establishment of the complex by allowing south korean small and middle sized companies hiring cheap labors from north korea brought synergetic effect on the south korean economy the complex is now reputed to have promoted peace on the korean peninsula and to have served as the bastion of peace whenever the north and south relationship is strained some people criticize that he has not taken a tougher stance on north korea and that he had rhetorical clashes with the united states that helped weaken relations between the two countries he was once accused of attempting to distract reporters from a meeting of activists for human rights in north korea however some of the criticisms are biased by the onesided political perspective from the people who support the hardline approach to north korea the contention that he had impeded on the relationship between south korea and the united states can be counter proven by the process he had made the keasong complex realized the keasong complex could not have made possible unless the then bush administer had authorized the approve of foreign materials flowing into north korea the realization of the complex in the middle of hawk driven period of axis of evil can only be correctly explained by the quick and wide approach by the then unification ministry and the minister chung to convince the us government and the korean counterpartin march 2007 while visiting the north korean town of kaesong where south korean companies are set up he proposed that an interkorean summit be organized there however since he had lost the presidential election that year under the lee myungbak government it never materializedon october 15 2007 the united new democratic party announced that chung won about 44 percent of the votes in the party primary beating two other candidates to become the partys candidate for the presidential elections that yearchung however lost the elections to the oppositions grand national party candidate lee myungbak by the widest margin since direct elections began in 1987 the loss was attributed primarily to the peoples disappointment of the economic situation and its dealings and continuous political strife under the roh muhyun government as well as the unsuccessful campaign strategies that overly relied on criticizing the other candidate lee myungbak the issue of the presidential election in 2007 was predominantly about determining truth of the implication of the presidential candidate lee myung bak in the allegation of the investment advisory firm bbk ltd which had then been accused of large scale stock price manipulation that hurt thousands of individual investors the primary issue was to prove that he was the real owner of the company lee strongly denied the claim even thought there have been plenty of evidence he was at least closely related to the heads of the company and even there was a video tape showing he claiming himself to be the owner of the company however any hearings or legal trials of the case had not realized during the presidential election period and obviously after lee become the president the case lost its force despite the wide public attention to it let alone the case lee myungbak was previously committed fourteen different cases of violations or crimes however the widespread perception of the people that the new president has to be the one who can efficiently control the economy has given him the strong edge over the opponent candidate evidently the legitimacy of the president was an issue from the perspective of chung and chungs party he stated that should the turnout for the presidential elections be under 50 that the legitimacy of the result may be an issue however the voter turnout was 629earlier chung also criticized opposition leader park geunhye of the grand national party that they exploited the event to make an image that she is a victim to emotionally move the voters by immediately campaigning during that partys primaries after her recovery from an attack by a man who slashed her face with a small knife later he attributed the downfall of his party in the poll to the attackpredictably the uri party suffered a major defeat in the elections in which the opposition grand national party took 13 of the 16 provinces and major

were farmers and peasant artisans his mother a weaver and his father a wood carver from an early age nedelchev was a compulsive drawerat fifteen after a quarrel with his father nedelchev ran away from home to the black sea coast taking various jobs to survive at eighteen he was conscripted into the army for three years of national service on completion he enrolled at the newly formed state art school in rousse where he met painter marko monev and shared a studioin 1963 nedelchev and monev journeyed widely through rural bulgaria sketching and painting and attempting to make contact with other artists as they travelled this period in bulgarian history was a time when the conditions of the peasantry were being vastly transformed by the collectivisation process nedelchev and monev observed the dying ways and traditions and this is reflected in their works in 1964 the two ended their travels back at the danube nedelchev was befriended by the artist trifon nikolov and for a time lived and painted in his studioby 1966 nedelchev was starting to have regular exhibitions and at one of these he met his future wife mariya in 1968 they married and moved to razgrad where nedelchev

of the event and the lack of support for it within the rest of the chilean military such a connection is considered unlikely however there is considerable published information about the chilean organisation patria y libertad that did promote the coup attempt and members of that group notoriously took refuge in the embassy of ecuador when the coups failure was made clear soupers cousin carlos

zhytomyr region in 1955 he entered the geologic department at the shevchenko kyiv state university however the extraordinary gift of samoilenko for mathematics determined his destiny in its own way and instead of a known geologist science got a prominent mathematician in 1960 samoilenko graduated from the department of mechanics and mathematics at the shevchenko kyiv state university with mathematics specialization at the same time his first scientific works were publishedin 1963 after the graduation from the postgraduate courses at the institute of mathematics of the academy of

and began his work at the institute of mathematics of the academy of sciences of the ukrainian ssr under the supervision of academician yu a mitropolskiy in few years of diligent research work samoilenko became one of the leading experts in the qualitative theory of differential equations in 1967 based on the results of his research in the theory of multifrequency oscillations he defended his doctoraldegree thesis some problems of the theory of periodic and quasiperiodic systems the official opponents of which were v i arnold and d v anosov in 19651974 samoilenko worked as a senior

my teachers in many fields of science they were trendsetters on the scale of the soviet union it is very important for a young scientist to belong to a serious scientific school probably only in this case he has a chance to obtain results at the world level the atmosphere of a good scientific school itself stimulates a young scientist to carry out his research work at the cutting edge of modern science and if he suddenly opens a new direction in science then his name immediately gains recognitionin 19741987 samoilenko headed the chair of integral and differential equations of the department of mechanics and mathematics at the shevchenko kyiv state university these years were marked by especially high scientific activity of the chair based on results of the research in the theory of differential equations with delay performed at that time the monograph of mitropolskiy samoilenko and d i martynyuk was published at the same time samoilenko together with his disciple m o perestyuk

is also well known three years later the monograph of samoilenko in coauthorship with mitropolskii and v l kulyk was published in this monograph in particular the method of lyapunov functions was used for the investigation of dichotomies in linear differential systems of the general form the results of manyyear investigations of constructive methods in the theory of boundaryvalued problems for ordinary differential equations carried out by samoilenko together with m ronto are presented in monographs constructive algorithms for finding solutions of boundaryvalue problems with different
