economist concerned mainly with industrial economics and comparative economic systems he made one of the most thorough descriptions of a future economy where allocation is done by democratic planning and social ownership without any social division of labour although with functional divisions of labour the model is notable for specifying an array of social ownership rights and an analytic distinction between market forces and market relations another key aspect of devines work has been a close reading of the economic calculation debate1 and later attempts to offer a serious response to the objections by the austrian school of economic theory similarly devines work on the subject of industrial planning has largely constituted an extended critique of the austrian theory of entrepreneurship in this vein devine has argued that a major weakness in the modern austrian schools emphasis on the need for tacit knowledge to be socially mobilised by entrepreneurs participating in the market process is that participation is restricted to those with access to capital thus ignoring the tacit knowledge of the majority of people pat devine is a joint author of the book an introduction to industrial economics and author of democracy and economic planning he and collaborators fikret adaman and begum ozkaynak are particularly notable for their elaboration of a visionary
