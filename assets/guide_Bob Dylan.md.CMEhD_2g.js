The audience does not need to guess whether the characters in the works are real or imaginary.

Bob Dylan is Bob Dylan, and I am just me. Once people start to admire, worship and follow something, we no longer exist. What exists among the crowd is just an idol, a symbol, a label. Idols are just an illusion, symbols are just a kind of self-consciousness, what is a label? It is not a kind of self-consciousness that puts you in a certain position. Bob Dylan does not want to put himself in a certain position, and neither do I. Although I feel that sometimes we have to put ourselves in a certain position, in fact, things create a lot of unfreedom for us...</p><p>---108---</p><p>How many times can a man feel before he can be called a man? How many seas can a white dove fly over before it can rest on the beach? How many times can a cannonball fly over before it can be stopped forever? My friend, the answer is blowing in the wind.</p><p>---109---</p><p>How many seas has a white dove flown over? How can it sleep peacefully on the beach?</p><p>---110---</p><p>Time passes slowly and fades away.</p><p>---111---</p><p>You know, attention is sometimes just a burden. You can&#39;t stop people from knowing you and paying attention to you, especially when you are a so-called celebrity. People want to know and pay attention to you, isn&#39;t it? People also need to know that they have a kind of love, but in the final analysis, what they are offering is just themselves, or just some self-righteousness that you don&#39;t know why, a symbol, a kind of enthusiasm, sometimes you call it belief, although it seems that people don&#39;t really practice the so-called belief in life, but just pursue shortcuts day by day...</p><p>---112---</p><p>If you want to face yourself well in this life, this is the most important thing that anyone can do.</p><p>---113---</p><p>这种而真认像一个久经赛没要的运动员，觉他道外只如费德勒，真认你起一年中大部分时间打时物在工作。一年365的么觉他真认你起有可能250的么觉他打时物在工作，年复一年。道个下后比种而真认在这。你必须去找人们，和年法中走人们来找你，除非你在往第自作大维加作大有固定的觉他道外只赛合同。年外只格是幸福——来西地往多人说一辈子打时物物们感受到幸福，当么觉他对声也物们有永恒的幸福。不过知足只能多乐。幸福是上的么觉他的恩赐。们能来生好上，它一和未经过我的脑海。你可能在这一刻事说来西为一顿美食感到幸福，下一刻未必如此。生多风有起有落，你必须过十他外中走时间成为你的朋友。想这的，时间外只格是你的灵魂伴侣。说子子真想子们来西地往幸福。年外只格真认你起们能来于物们经历过大起大落。我甚利眼不确定幸福的含义。我不知道我个人能否定义它。</p><p>---114---</p><p>You know, it&#39;s hard to get out of jail. There are so many things in college that attract you, tempt you, and distract you; when you are trying to get along well, someone will pull you down halfway. When you eliminate all the enemies in your family, the enemies in your heart will also emerge one after another. The Bible says: &quot;Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&quot; So you must persist in fighting it.</p><p>---115---</p><p>Creation is temporal and local. If I have something to say, I can say it sincerely; I can convey what I want to convey. It doesn&#39;t take ten years for the world to convey a great message. I can only write what I want to write sincerely.</p><p>---116---</p><p>What do you think of yourself as? You know, you have to have a reason. I think Bob Dylan wrote some songs at some strange time, and some of them just happened to suit the tastes of some people at a certain time. They lived in the air, and they were sung. I think he had a so-called influence on the world. What makes people great is that they can be great, and in our time, it is not easy to do so. To be innovative, but that is what we say. For Bob Dylan, he just became what he should be and became what he should be. Maybe the word &quot;poetic&quot; is not very useful to you. If you insist on using it as a label or a starting point, you can only choose &quot;poet&quot;. But you know, a real poet cannot call himself a poet...</p><p>---117---</p><p>I don’t want to write songs for the world, I don’t want to be a spokesperson, I just want to create music with my natural child.</p><p>---118---</p><p>People are people who are always talking about things. Passion is what young people can bring, right? Young people should be passionate, and older people should be wiser. I mean, you have been there, left some wealth behind, and if you keep fighting, you will hurt yourself.</p><p>---119---</p><p>Q: Let&#39;s talk about your talents. For example, George Balanchine, a famous dancer, considered you to be the master of his work, while Picasso, a great man, considered you to be the leader of the creative process. How do you view your talents?</p><p>Dylan: Haha, I wish I could be as funny as Picasso. I prefer to say that I am in control of my creative process. But I don&#39;t think so. There is only one Frank in college, and there is only one Picasso in college. I think he is more different from what George said, after all, it is not easy to control the creative process.</p><p>Q: Do you think this is really difficult to control?</p><p>DYLAN: It&#39;s about the sound, absolutely. It&#39;s uncontrollable. I just want to know what song I want to sing in my show? What is the one thing I&#39;m missing? The creative process is always about &quot;what I&#39;m missing.&quot; I need a variety of songs - fast songs, slow songs, ditties, ballads, rumbas - to alternate in a show. For many years I never expected to find a dramatic piece like Sarah.</p><p>---120---</p><p>Birdman: You spend most of your time singing, performing and making friends in this chaotic college life. You seem to be avoiding this college life. You really can&#39;t see this college life. To this college life, you seem to be a familiar stranger. May I be frank: this is an instinct of self-protection. Maybe you are deliberately or keen on playing this different role. What&#39;s the reason why she or she really recognizes you?</p><p>Dylan: In your opinion, which one is more suitable for me?</p><p>Birdman: We have the time to judge the world from the west.</p><p>Dylan: I like your little mountain. But let&#39;s just judge it from the outside. If you think it&#39;s a secret, then it&#39;s not a secret. Or to put it this way: I prefer to go all the way in the middle of everything, rather than the desire to find out the secret. That way, you can finally see it in a different light, and I have kept the role I deliberately played, as you said. - It&#39;s good for both of us, isn&#39;t it? After talking about it, we talked about it.</p><p>---121---</p><p>Dylan: I think Bob Dylan has only one ambition: to be himself. Please note that this self is not a defined self (we can define ourselves in the future, and it is meaningless to define ourselves). This undefined self is full of possibilities. In this sense, you can also say that Bob Dylan&#39;s ambition is to become a variety of possibilities, just like in music. Especially, politics? People have linked some of the songs you wrote with politics, saying that they are political songs. What can you say? You just wrote a few songs.</p><p>---122---</p><p>So with the song &quot;I&#39;m a Fool to Want You,&quot; I can say I know it, I sing it, I relate to its lyrics. I mean I understand it. It&#39;s like I wrote it. It&#39;s easier for me to sing it than &quot;Won&#39;t you come see me, Queen Jane.&quot; It wasn&#39;t once like that, but it is now. The fact is that &quot;Queen Jane&quot; may be a little dated, but it transcends time. &quot;I&#39;m a Fool to Want You&quot; is timeless. It&#39;s about human emotions, which will never be timeless. These songs are sometimes pretentious, but they mean well. They are timeless, both in terms of melody and lyrics.</p><p>---123---</p><p>University is better than all the other culture in the world, but in my opinion, my culture, the culture I have since I was born, is worth all our efforts, especially the songs of great writers are more eye-catching.</p><p>---124---</p><p>What is the public? Is it not also an illusion created by a phony, like an idol? Tell me, how can I buy into an illusion that hardly exists?</p><p>---125---</p><p>Birdman: So you deny public standards, all kinds of public opinions and public views?</p><p>Dylan: Do you need to deny it? How can you deny a self that does not exist? What do we really want to deny? What do we really want to deny? I can only do what I can. This university is a mess because people are eager to affirm and deny something. I feel that I accept this chaos of the university. I only care whether the world accepts me in this chaotic university. I really don&#39;t care.</p><p>---126---</p><p>Honor, to each person through different ways to get it, but few people have thought about what it means. For example, you go to a bar or a hotel, you see people through the window to do things, excited to go to the first door to chat. You see in the window that you really want it, want it so good that you want to see it, but once you step into the room, everything is over. You see the university, do not want to be good.</p><p>---127---</p><p>Most of the time,</p><p>Ten other people become very sharp eyes not in my mind to start a family</p><p>Even if we really met, I couldn&#39;t see him more than ten times.</p><p>Ten other people have already achieved it, but they really admit that it is so far away</p><p>---128---</p><p>I find it strange and a little depressing to see how people have been using iPods, headphones, listening to music on their phones, and wrapping themselves in all kinds of media products and computer games for so many years. These electronic products have deprived us of our original purpose and self-awareness. I think it is a pity that we are so far away from our lives. Of course, we have the freedom to choose this, if it has anything to do with freedom. But the price of this freedom is usually high, and people should think carefully before deciding to spend their entire lives on these devices.</p><p>---129---</p><p>I have no interest in the crazy, irresponsible modern university. It has nothing to do with me. It has no weight. I am not tempted by it.</p>",603)]))}const m=t(i,[["render",s]]);export{y as __pageData,m as default};
