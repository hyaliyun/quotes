In my profession, I&#39;ve just moved along with my age. By thinking in decades, rather than whether someone&#39;s 42 or 47, you can give yourself a whole 10 years to turn yourself around in.</p><p>We all know now that people can look good for their age. It isn&#39;t so extraordinary, I don&#39;t know why people go on about it so much.</p><p>A lot of music you might listen to is pretty vapid, it doesn&#39;t always deal with our deeper issues. These are the things I&#39;m interested in now, particularly at my age.</p><p>Life expectancy in many parts of Africa can be something around the age of thirty five to thirty eight.

It&#39;s just that a lot of those stories revolve around problems that I can&#39;t convincingly portray at this age.</p><p>I had the good fortune to be able to right an injustice that I thought was being heaped on young people by lowering the voting age, where you had young people that were old enough to die in Vietnam but not old enough to vote for their members of Congress that sent them there.</p><p>The value of old age depends upon the person who reaches it.

To others, who are late to develop, it just enables them to finish the job.</p><p>I&#39;ve gotten crankier in my old age.</p><p>I&#39;ve been very competitive by nature from a young age, whether it was eating a bowl of pasta faster than somebody else, or always wanting to be the first one in line.</p><p>Death comes not to the living soul, nor age to the loving heart.</p><p>I&#39;m not busy... a woman with three children under the age of 10 wouldn&#39;t think my schedule looked so busy.</p><p>High expectations weren&#39;t nurtured in my neck of nowhere back then - children weren&#39;t fawned over from an early age as &#39;gifted&#39; and groomed for a prizewinning future self-esteem was considered something you had to pick from the garden yourself.</p><p>Not by age but by capacity is wisdom acquired.</p><p>Whoever marries the spirit of this age will find himself a widower in the next.</p><p>Of middle age the best that can be said is that a middle-aged person has likely learned how to have a little fun in spite of his troubles.</p><p>Old age is always wakeful as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with aught that looks like death.</p><p>What I think is amazing is not that 85% of people who get married under the age of 25 get divorced, it&#39;s that 15% of them stay together. How did they manage to pull that off? You almost can&#39;t wait too long.

My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie. The networks just wouldn&#39;t spend the money today.</p><p>I was taught from a young age that many people would treat me as a second-class citizen because I was African-American and because I was female.</p><p>Even from a very early age, I knew I didn&#39;t want to miss out on anything life had to offer just because it might be considered dangerous.</p><p>We live in an age where anonymity is growing in magnitude like a bomb going off.</p><p>I was a mixture of being incredibly old for my age and incredibly backwards.

This is the only country on Earth in the 21st century that has renewed imperialistic ambitions. They really want to become the hegemon of the Middle East in an age that gave up imperialism.</p><p>I think it&#39;s quite extraordinary that people cast me as if I&#39;m Warren Beatty: until I met my present wife, at the age of 35, you could name two girlfriends.</p><p>Craziest thing I&#39;ve done for love is getting married. I think it&#39;s crazy. I think it&#39;s crazy, crazy, crazy. I&#39;m never going to say I wouldn&#39;t do it again but I have to make sure it&#39;s love and not settling for the &#39;I have to do this by a certain age,&#39; which is kind of what I did.</p><p>You never choose the way that you&#39;re raised, it&#39;s just the way that you were raised, but you do get to a certain age where you&#39;re in a position to question the expectations of you and the way that you&#39;ve been formed by your surroundings.</p><p>We tried not to age, but time had its rage.</p><p>I want to age with some dignity.</p><p>This is my 20th year in the sport. I&#39;ve known swimming and that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t want to swim past age 30 if I continue after this Olympics, and come back in 2016, I&#39;ll be 31. I&#39;m looking forward to being able to see the other side of the fence.</p><p>Young man, the secret of my success is that an early age I discovered that I was not God.</p><p>I&#39;d like to talk about free markets. Information in the computer age is the last genuine free market left on earth except those free markets where indigenous people are still surviving. And that&#39;s basically becoming limited.</p><p>I would often find myself, at the age of 21, at midnight, running down a dark street on my own with 10 men chasing me. And the fact they had cameras in their hands made that legal.</p><p>Bring a wife home to your house when you are of the right age, not far short of 30 years, nor much above this is the right time for marriage.</p><p>There are only two things a child will share willingly communicable diseases and its mother&#39;s age.</p><p>Although it is generally known, I think it&#39;s about time to announce that I was born at a very early age.</p><p>I think it&#39;s your mental attitude. So many of us start dreading age in high school and that&#39;s a waste of a lovely life. &#39;Oh... I&#39;m 30, oh, I&#39;m 40, oh, 50.&#39; Make the most of it.</p><p>No, no, I was only funny on stage, really. I, I, think I was funny as a person toward my classmates when I was very young. You know, when I was a child, up to about the age of 12.</p><p>What goes on in Europe concerns us greatly because, if Europe comes apart, the E.U. comes apart, then you&#39;re going to have enormous impact on America, that&#39;s a very big trading partner of ours, and people own securities around the world in this day and age.</p><p>Your body actually reminds you about your age and your injuries - the body has a stronger memory than your mind.</p><p>People dance at any age.</p><p>I never had little brothers, so I was totally not used to hearing a lot of cussing at a young age! I learned what &#39;pull my finger&#39; meant the hard way.</p><p>My sister and I shared a bedroom our entire lives and I believe she discovered the Beatles when she was about 11 and I&#39;m four years younger. So from the age of 7 until 17 we had nothing but Beatles paraphernalia in our room, even those little stuffed Beatles that went on stands that are dressed as the Sgt. Pepper band.</p><p>But look, I was born in 1956, the peak year for births in US history. I think I&#39;m very representative of many of the thought processes my generation have been through and, by and large, people of my age have had their imprint planted on the consciousness of western society for a long time.</p><p>I basically get stereotyped a lot in terms of being a girl and writing &#39;chick&#39; music for teenage girls or something. I think, if anything, the press kind of, because of my gender and my age, tends to kind of relegate my work to this sort of special-interest group. It&#39;s part of the cultural dynamic, I guess.</p><p>What is amazing for a woman of my age is that I change as the world is changing-and changing very, very fast. I don&#39;t think my mother had that opportunity to change.</p><p>I&#39;ve never worried about age.</p><p>To me age is a number, just a number. Who cares?</p><p>If you&#39;re extremely, painfully frightened of age, it shows.</p><p>For a man who has compared himself to Theodore Roosevelt and the nation&#39;s challenges to those of the Gilded Age, Obama put forward a tepid agenda.</p><p>I wrote a screenplay for a &#39;Sweet Valley High&#39; adaptation, and it&#39;s really amazing to me how many women who are my age have responded to the idea and are excited about the movie.</p><p>Let age, not envy, draw wrinkles on thy cheeks.</p><p>Here&#39;s my Golden Rule for a tarnished age: Be fair with others, but keep after them until they&#39;re fair with you.</p><p>Children under five are the poorest age group in America, and one in four infants, toddlers and preschoolers are poor during the years of greatest brain development.</p><p>Everyone talks about age, but it&#39;s not about age. It&#39;s about work ethic. Winning never gets old.</p><p>Age is a terrible avenger. The lessons of life give you so much to work with, but by the time you&#39;ve got all this great wisdom, you don&#39;t get to be young anymore.</p><p>Science cannot tell theology how to construct a doctrine of creation, but you can&#39;t construct a doctrine of creation without taking account of the age of the universe and the evolutionary character of cosmic history.</p><p>I came of age believing that, no matter what happened, I would always be able to support myself.</p><p>Dallas&#39; hit a chord back in the late Seventies and Eighties because it was the age of greed: here you have this unapologetic character who is mean and nasty and ruthless and does it all with an evil grin. I think people related to JR back then because we all have someone we know exactly like him. Everyone in the world knows a JR.;Larry Hagman;age 586;I&#39;ve never been more in love with anyone nearly half my age than I am today.

So I&#39;m a godmom now, which is crazy.;Kristen Stewart;age 590;I think I&#39;m a bit less inhibited, and not thinking too much before speaking.

You get Sean Connery, who gets older and older, still playing opposite young ladies, but it doesn&#39;t work the other way around.</p><p>Old age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance.</p><p>My wife and I, unlike many intellectuals, spent five years working on assembly lines. We came to fully understand the criticisms of the industrial age, in which you are an appendage of a machine that sets the pace.</p><p>Even one voice can be heard loudly all over the world in this day and age.</p><p>At this age, I should be leading a quiet life.</p><p>Any new financial order for the world must tackle the three chief challenges of our age.</p><p>There are signs that the age of petroleum has passed its zenith. Adjusted for inflation, a barrel of crude oil now sells for three times its long-run average. The large western oil companies, which cartellised the industry for much of the 20th century, are now selling more oil than they find, and are thus in the throes of liquidation.</p><p>With the song &#39;This Christmas&#39; I wanted to do something that was kind of different. I mean, Donny Hathaway is an amazing artist. So I wanted to bring my flavor to the song so when people over the age of 45 or 50 hear it they&#39;ll be like &#39;OK, he did his thing with that record.&#39; It&#39;s like I can appeal to everybody and not just a younger demographic.</p><p>In an age when the fashion is to be in love with yourself, confessing to be in love with somebody else is an admission of unfaithfulness to one&#39;s beloved.</p><p>Rereading A.J. Liebling carries me happily back to an age when all good journalists knew they had plenty to be modest about, and were.</p><p>Reason is a crutch for age, but youth is strong enough to walk alone.</p><p>What&#39;s a man&#39;s age? He must hurry more, that&#39;s all Cram in a day, what his youth took a year to hold.</p><p>What Youth deemed crystal, Age finds out was dew.</p><p>A face to lose youth for, to occupy age With the dream of, meet death with.</p><p>I believe the true function of age is memory. I&#39;m recording as fast as I can.</p><p>So Harry Potter came in and it is nice that I have kids of the right age. I took them to London and they walked around the set and met Harry Potter and that is thrilling.</p><p>All we can do when we think of kids today is think of more hours of school, earlier age at the computer, and curfews. Who would want to grow up in that world?</p><p>The reason for the sadness of this modern age and the men who live in it is that it looks for the truth in everything and finds it.</p><p>No, but way before that, I&#39;ve been doing little dances in movies for years. Yeah, that was an amazing chance. You know, at my age to be able to do a music dance video, very unusual.</p><p>There probably aren&#39;t a lot of actors my age who tap dance.</p><p>I started auditioning when I was about 10 and I didn&#39;t get my first job until I was 12, and two years at that age is really hard.</p><p>I remember being in Hollywood at the age of 16 and marveling at the stars. The idea of being part of it never entered my mind. It was too far-fetched.</p><p>The older generation had greater respect for land than science. But we live in an age when science, more than soil, has become the provider of growth and abundance. Living just on the land creates loneliness in an age of globality.</p><p>One of my grandfathers, actually, having gone out there as a minister, decided he would better serve the people as a doctor. So at a very late age - at the age of 38 in fact - he changed course and decided to become a doctor.</p><p>I&#39;m totally into new age and self-help books. I used to work in a bookstore and that&#39;s the section they gave me, and I got way into it. I just loved the power of positive thinking, letting yourself go.</p><p>It&#39;s the kind of clothes that mothers and daughters can wear, in terms of concept... It&#39;s not about age. It&#39;s about taste, and it&#39;s about lifestyle. I believe women of all ages can wear anything.</p><p>The reason for the slow progress of the world seems to lie in a single fact. Every man is born under the yoke, and grows up beneath the oppressions of his age.</p><p>A newspaper is lumber made malleable. It is ink made into words and pictures. It is conceived, born, grows up and dies of old age in a day.</p><p>Just as we reject racism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism, we reject speciesism. The species of a sentient being is no more reason to deny the protection of this basic right than race, sex, age, or sexual orientation is a reason to deny membership in the human moral community to other humans.</p><p>I am a grandmother now, and that means age is creeping on, creeping on.</p><p>I love things that age well - things that don&#39;t date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best.</p><p>Many women my age have known the experience of giving up crucial parts of themselves to please the man they love.</p><p>American Idol transcends age, gender, ethnicity, everything.</p><p>You get to a certain age and you can&#39;t judge yourself on your dad or your parents.</p><p>I&#39;d like to look like Madonna when I&#39;m her age. I also look at athletes and love their bodies. I&#39;ve always wanted to be muscly, not skinny. A lot of women yo-yo around, but I&#39;m always aware if I&#39;m getting a bit out of shape. I never look at the scales but I can just tell. It goes on my tum and bum.</p><p>I could always sing, from a really young age, but my voice was really weird. I used to make my mum turn up the radio every day in our house. She was well into music so I got that from her.</p><p>I think women get caught up too much in having a plan - &#39;I&#39;m going to get married at this age I&#39;m going to have a kid at this age&#39; - and then they just try to find a guy who will fit into that picture. I don&#39;t want my life to be based on that.</p><p>I was always concerned with writing to my age at a particular moment. That was the way I would keep faith with the audience that supported me as I went along.</p><p>Experts tell us that 90% of all brain development occurs by the age of five. If we don&#39;t begin thinking about education in the early years, our children are at risk of falling behind by the time they start Kindergarten.</p><p>When I was seventeen, I worked as a counsellor at a co-ed sleep-away camp for eight weeks. I loved it but it could be harrowing - it was far too much responsibility for someone my age.</p><p>Music has always been my protection against the world, from a very young age. I feel safe inside of a jam.</p><p>We are the children of a technological age. We have found streamlined ways of doing much of our routine work. Printing is no longer the only way of reproducing books. Reading them, however, has not changed.</p><p>Religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age. The idea that society can do without it flies in the face of history and, now, evolutionary biology.</p><p>Religiosity turns out to be the best indicator of civic involvement: it&#39;s more accurate than education, age, income, gender or race.</p><p>The year I was born, 1956, was the peak year for babies being born, and there are more people essentially our age than anybody else. We could crush these new generations if we decided too.</p><p>Adulthood is the ever-shrinking period between childhood and old age. It is the apparent aim of modern industrial societies to reduce this period to a minimum.</p><p>I was born at the age of twelve on a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot.</p><p>We live in an age of instant knowledge. And there&#39;s almost a sense of entitlement to that.</p><p>It&#39;s the golden age of French cinema again but it&#39;s because Sarkozy had the guts to push through copyright law.</p><p>I started in the restaurant business at the age of 19 as a waitress. I loved the atmosphere and the camaraderie of the restaurant business. I loved not having to go to an office. I loved making people happy.</p><p>My view is pensioners don&#39;t have the one option that people of working age have. They can&#39;t really increase their income, because they are no longer able to work.</p><p>Work is transformative. It gives you a greater chance of a greater income. You can affect your life while you&#39;re of working age, so you have scope and opportunity. Pensioners do not.</p><p>I think you can&#39;t really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child, whether it&#39;s New Age or Judaism or Buddhism or whatever it is. You can&#39;t escape it, even if you completely disagree with it, you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of.</p><p>At my age the only problem is with remembering names. When I call everyone darling, it has damn all to do with passionately adoring them, but I know I&#39;m safe calling them that. Although, of course, I adore them too.</p><p>What I really tried to do with Helen was make her show this sad side of her. She was married off at 16, was so young and living in this castle that can&#39;t leave because of how she looks, and married to a man she hates and three times her age.</p><p>I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland. And when we moved to America, it was just the typical thing except I was really good at it so was my brother.</p><p>I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland.</p><p>When I write about a 15-year old, I jump, I return to the days when I was that age. It&#39;s like a time machine. I can remember everything. I can feel the wind. I can smell the air. Very actually. Very vividly.</p><p>We live in an age, in an era where there is so much negativity, there is so much violence in the world, there is so much unrest and people are at war, that I wanted to promote the word love and red signifies love.</p><p>I&#39;m 20 years old. I like to party as much as anyone my age. Going clubbing is my way of relaxing or releasing a lot of stress. I don&#39;t feel that I should have to justify that part of my life. I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m necessarily an addict.</p><p>I am happy being able to play roles with people my age because once you do something really mature there is no turning back.</p><p>Compared to a lot of actresses my age, I&#39;m actually overweight.</p><p>This is what I asked for, and in this day and age that&#39;s what actually goes on. But what hurts me the most is that I work just as hard as any other actress around my age, like Scarlett Johansson, but I just don&#39;t get the opportunities that they get because people are so distracted by the mess that I created in my life.</p><p>At a young age, I was interested in comic books, which was really how I learnt to read. The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man.</p><p>There is a certain age at which a child looks at you in all earnestness and delivers a long, pleased speech in all the true inflections of spoken English, but with not one recognizable syllable.</p><p>I can&#39;t wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach, all my own age. We&#39;d be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs. Driving golf carts around. I can&#39;t wait.</p><p>I would love a family. I&#39;m at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger. But who knows.</p><p>I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts. When I was growing up, I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher. So I&#39;m naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself.</p><p>Love, with very young people, is a heartless business. We drink at that age from thirst, or to get drunk it is only later in life that we occupy ourselves with the individuality of our wine.</p><p>Age for me is just a number.</p><p>You hit a certain age and - especially because of TV - the young cooks coming up say, &#39;You&#39;re a sellout, because you&#39;re doing something other than what you should be doing.&#39; &#39;Top Chef&#39; is a double-edged sword for me: There&#39;s a whole group of people who will not come to the restaurants because they assume I&#39;m not in them anymore, all I do is TV.</p><p>Some of your teachers are actually closer in age to you than you think.</p><p>From an early age I didn&#39;t buy into the value systems of working hard in a nine-to-five job. I thought creativity, friendship and loyalty and pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable was much more interesting.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have any success in show business until I was 30 to 31 years of age.</p><p>I hate the idea that you shouldn&#39;t wear something just because you&#39;re a certain age.</p><p>I am firmly of the opinion that women who make a lot of effort to hang onto their looks in middle age (unless they are beauties, entertainers or prostitutes) are rather sad, as one should surely have something more substantial to recommend one by this time, such as kindness or cleverness.</p><p>As a precocious teen I dreamed of being Graham Greene. Well, as it turned out, I never wrote a great novel, sadly, and I never converted to Catholicism, happily, but I did do one thing he did. That is, in middle age I moved to a seaside town and got into a right barney with the local powers-that-be.</p><p>Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character.</p><p>Age is only a number, a cipher for the records. A man can&#39;t retire his experience. He must use it. Experience achieves more with less energy and time.</p><p>To me, old age is always fifteen years older than I am.</p><p>I wear clothes that most people in the Midwest would probably deem inappropriate at my age. And I rock a bikini all summer long. I know that it&#39;s not normal, but I just don&#39;t care. I live once.</p><p>I&#39;ve lost touch with a lot of that boutique-type music just because of my age, and raising my son and the multiple jobs I have at this point.</p><p>There&#39;s no way to approach anything in an objective way. We&#39;re completely subjective our view of the world is completely controlled by who we are as human beings, as men or women, by our age, our history, our profession, by the state of the world.</p><p>Age is not measured by years. Nature does not equally distribute energy. Some people are born old and tired while others are going strong at seventy.</p><p>Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose.</p><p>When I was younger, my whole sense of self-worth was based on whether or not I was working, which was awful. And I had a baby at 20 years old, so it wasn&#39;t just about me. At around the age of 30 there was a stretch where I wasn&#39;t working - certainly not on anything I liked, anyway - and I started to do other things.</p><p>I grew up on the golden age of children&#39;s TV.</p><p>I do wish I could tell you my age but it&#39;s impossible. It keeps changing all the time.</p><p>Pretend to be dumb, that&#39;s the only way to reach old age.</p><p>The excitement of learning separates youth from old age. As long as you&#39;re learning you&#39;re not old.</p><p>The history of my life must begin by the earliest circumstance which my memory can evoke it will therefore commence when I had attained the age of eight years and four months.</p><p>We are in an electronic technology age now and it&#39;s about time we put away the old stuff.</p><p>At the age of 20 I bought a used Fiat 127. This was the only one I could afford!</p><p>At my age, I don&#39;t think anyone is untouched by cancer.</p><p>We try, we fail, we posture, we aspire, we pontificate - and then we age, shrink, die, and vanish.</p><p>My habit would have been to veer towards the dark - to prove I was something edgy, or maybe to prove that I was cognisant of the dark side. Now, with age and confidence, I can say, yeah, that&#39;s true, but I am cognisant of the fact that people can do things well. And can be more loving than you expect.</p><p>It is not possible to live in this age if you don&#39;t have a sense of many contradictory forces.</p><p>I&#39;m very accepting with my age. It&#39;s like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you&#39;ve become comfortable in your skin.</p><p>You need some insecurity if you&#39;re an actor. It keeps the pot boiling. I haven&#39;t yet started to think about retiring. I was shocked when I heard about Paul Newman retiring at age 82. Most actors just fade away like old soldiers.</p><p>It&#39;s hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I&#39;m not discouraged.</p><p>We&#39;re still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That&#39;s the old metaphor: You&#39;re born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude.</p><p>We can no longer waste time and money. Every day, more than 2,000 girls in America, age 15-19, give birth - in the wealthiest, most educated nation in the world! Neither you nor I should accept this statistic.</p><p>The reality is sobering: in the United States one in three girls will become pregnant before age 20, totaling more than 750,000 girls per year.</p><p>I am hoping for peaceful transition into a new age. Obama has already played a great role in initiating us into that vision. If he were to be harmed in any way, it would spawn the birth of a million Obamas.</p><p>I definitely don&#39;t look my age. So I actively look for roles that will help people change their perception of me.</p><p>The age thing really bugs me. Do people have more of a right to not like what I say because I&#39;m 19?</p><p>There are a lot of downsides to being male. We age faster and die younger. But give us this: we&#39;re lifetime baby-making machines. Women&#39;s reproductive abilities start to wane when they&#39;re as young as 35. Men? We&#39;re good to go pretty much till we&#39;re dead.</p><p>Older fatherhood isn&#39;t all bad: testosterone rates drop about 1% per year as men age, making them less reactive and more patient, and a professionally established middle-aged man is likely to have more time and money to devote to his kids than a twenty-something who&#39;s just getting started.</p><p>Credit or debit cards, for starters, are nothing short of shoppers&#39; Novocain. Even in the age of digital purchases and virtual money, we still attach a special value to dirty paper with pictures of presidents on it. Handing some of that to a cashier simply hurts more than handing over a little sliver of plastic.</p><p>When it comes to raising civilized kids there are no hard rules, but there are two things on which most parents agree: Boys are generally wilder than girls, and adolescents are wilder than kids of any other age. If you&#39;ve got an adolescent boy, you&#39;re in the sweet spot for trouble.</p><p>It seems to me there is a change in what audiences want to see. I can only hope that&#39;s correct, because there&#39;s an awful lot of people of my age around now and we outnumber the others.</p><p>A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity and once more in old age, as a fine building should be seen by morning light, at noon and by moonlight.</p><p>In Hollywood, you play a mom, and the next thing you know, you&#39;re on &#39;The Golden Girls.&#39; They age you so fast.</p><p>A great age of literature is perhaps always a great age of translations.</p><p>I can&#39;t get my knickers in a twist about my age and ageing in an industry that caters to the ids of 14-year-olds.</p><p>I was living on the wrong side of the tracks in Evanston, Illinois, in a home for boys. We had these Jackson 5 records. I really related to their voices - they were about my age, but they were doing it.</p><p>By age seven, I used to comb my hair for performances, just pull my hair up into a bun. Granted, it wasn&#39;t a very intricate hairstyle. Still, to be that responsible and disciplined at age seven is unusual.</p><p>It begins and ends with money. It&#39;s absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It&#39;s obscene.</p><p>I am at that age when you panic at the slightest thing.</p><p>Being gay and being a woman has one big thing in common, which is that we both become invisible after the age of 42. Who wants a gay 50-year-old? No one, let me tell you.</p><p>I began to speak well at a very advanced age - 15, 16, 17 years old. It was psychological: the trauma of war, my family and growing up on my own. I was more or less a street kid.</p><p>We Jews have a special attachment to the Book. The study of page after page in tomes yellowing with age was obligatory.</p><p>Having come to live in this age is as though one were to have entered another country. Learn its language or risk being left out.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to look at other people my age in leather. Why would I put it on?</p><p>I believe that the fight against crime starts in the home. Parents must take responsibility for their children and show them love and guidance from an early age so they learn to respect the rights of others.</p><p>At an early age, I started my own paper route. Once I saw how you could service people and do a good job and get paid for it, I just wanted to be the best I could be in whatever I did.</p><p>Middle age: when you begin to exchange your emotions for symptoms.</p><p>Brain power improves by brain use, just as our bodily strength grows with exercise. And there is no doubt that a large proportion of the female population, from school days to late middle age, now have very complicated lives indeed.</p><p>I began to understand my sensations, to know what I wanted, at around the age of forty - but only vaguely.</p><p>I grew up on a farm in a small town where you do or say one thing and everybody knows about it. You see it happen, there&#39;s always the town gossip - &#39;Oh did you hear about so and so, or did you hear what went on in this household?&#39; So I learned at a very young age just to keep my mouth shut.</p><p>If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I&#39;m a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.</p><p>The Border Ballads, for instance, and the Robin Hood Ballads, clearly suppose a state of society which is nothing but a very circumscribed and not very important heroic age.</p><p>By the age of 9 or 10, I knew that I had to cut my own cloth and make my own way.</p><p>When you&#39;re my age and you see a story, you better go for it pretty quickly. I&#39;d just like to get a few more novels under my belt.</p><p>Catholics and evangelicals need to remain allied, and in solidarity, against the increasingly aggressive secularism of our age.</p><p>I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s age or maturity, but I certainly find myself committed more and more to the looser forms of Western democracy at any price.</p><p>Losing both parents at a young age gave me a sense that you can&#39;t really control life - so you&#39;d better live it while it&#39;s here. I stopped believing in a storybook existence a long time ago. All you can do is push in a direction and see what comes of it.</p><p>Old age is not a disease - it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses.</p><p>I was a very sickly kid. While I was in the hospital at age 7, my Dad brought me a stack of comic books to keep me occupied. I was hooked.</p><p>Study until twenty-five, investigation until forty, profession until sixty, at which age I would have him retired on a double allowance.</p><p>In the digital age of &#39;overnight&#39; success stories such as Facebook, the hard slog is easily overlooked.</p><p>The greatest writers of this age... are aware of the mystery of our existence.</p><p>The chief role of the universities is to prolong adolescence into middle age, at which point early retirement ensures that we lack the means or the will to enforce significant change.</p><p>My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship. I watched them over the years and saw how they dealt with everything together, as a team.</p><p>My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship.</p><p>At my age it is unseemly to be pessimistic.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why people are so obsessed with age anyway. I mean, 90 is the new 70 70 is the new 50 and 50 is the new 40 so the whole act-your-age thing? Only up to a point.</p><p>I don&#39;t look my age, I don&#39;t feel my age and I don&#39;t act my age. To me age is just a number.</p><p>I believe that parents need to make nutrition education a priority in their home environment. It&#39;s crucial for good health and longevity to instill in your children sound eating habits from an early age.</p><p>Most poetry in the modern age has retreated to the private sphere, turning its back on the political realm.</p><p>We incorporated new tastes and flavors into our kids&#39; diets from a very early age, which helped to develop their palates and prevented them from becoming picky eaters. We don&#39;t buy junk food and give them options of fresh fruit, yogurt, raw almonds, or dried whole grain cereals for snack time.</p><p>Filth and old age, I&#39;m sure you will agree, are powerful wardens upon chastity.</p><p>It has been claimed at times that our modern age of technology facilitates dictatorship.</p><p>Working on the &#39;Ice Age&#39; movies, I&#39;m really proud to be in them.</p><p>No Congress ever has seen fit to amend the Constitution to address any issue related to marriage. No Constitutional Amendment was needed to ban polygamy or bigamy, nor was a Constitutional Amendment needed to set a uniform age of majority to ban child marriages.</p><p>We&#39;re taught at such a young age that you can always be better and that you&#39;re never perfect and that you&#39;re never good enough.</p><p>The young people have MTV and rock and roll. Why would they go to read poetry? Poetry belongs to the Stone Age. It awakens in us perceptions that go back to those times.</p><p>Study is the bane of childhood, the oil of youth, the indulgence of adulthood, and a restorative in old age.</p><p>Because of my age and because there&#39;s more work on the small screen. What it&#39;s missing in quality it makes up for in quantity. From an actor&#39;s selfish point of view.</p><p>Old age is an insult. It&#39;s like being smacked.</p><p>Age puzzles me. I thought it was a quiet time. My seventies were interesting and fairly serene, but my eighties are passionate. I grow more intense as I age.</p><p>One of the great challenges of our age, in which the tools of our productivity are also the tools of our leisure, is to figure out how to make more useful those moments of procrastination when we&#39;re idling in front of our computer screens.</p><p>I happen to be interested in watching a face age. I like faces of women aging so it makes me personally quite sad. That&#39;s a beautiful gift from God. If people don&#39;t want to see that anymore then I won&#39;t be in anymore movies.</p><p>Never say never, but the thought of electively cutting oneself is beyond my grasp, and I also object to it politically. Denying the lines on our faces makes a comment about age and wisdom I don&#39;t care to make.</p><p>People pay to see movies with women looking beautiful, but I think there will be a place for me to play women looking my own age.</p><p>There&#39;s a small club of women who are willing to age.</p><p>I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam.</p><p>I try to write lyrics so that they won&#39;t age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence.</p><p>In the modern media age we are rarely surprised by what we see. Whether it&#39;s on television or film or in the theatre, everything is so advertised, so trailed, that most entertainment is merely what you thought it was going to be like.</p><p>Your 40s are a major trough. About the age of 50, feelings of satisfaction begin to rebound and keep rising into your 50s, 60s and 70s, with health being a major factor.</p><p>I came back to work when my children were two months old. At that early age, they seem to have little awareness of anybody but their Raggedy Ann dolls, so it wasn&#39;t a matter of them missing me. I was missing them.</p><p>Being successful at a very young age gave me the confidence and the capability to try out other things.</p><p>About the time I turned 50, I experienced the profound biological change that often accompanies women at that age. Also, I put two kids in college and lost both of my parents, so I&#39;m no longer somebody&#39;s daughter.</p><p>I feel more mature than most people my age.</p><p>Age does not bring you wisdom, age brings you wrinkles.</p><p>Maybe I&#39;ll be a feminist in my old age.</p><p>I feel the 21st century is another new age. Not only can we collaborate again with nature, but we have to. It&#39;s an emergency.</p><p>You can fake your age or mask it, but the passion that moves the characters has to be real.</p><p>I think that clearly it has an influence, to be coming of age during the punk rock era, to come from a difficult and sporadically violent background, to have been in and out of such chaos, I think it actually helps. But I don&#39;t know for sure.</p><p>I&#39;d date someone younger or older age doesn&#39;t matter to me. Or looks, really - it&#39;s all about maturity.</p><p>Try to keep your soul young and quivering right up to old age.</p><p>I wanted to be a forest ranger or a coal man. At a very early age, I knew I didn&#39;t want to do what my dad did, which was work in an office.</p><p>Parenting is an impossible job at any age.</p><p>Sally Field looks amazing in general, never mind her age! She&#39;s a phenomenally talented actress and has had a career spanning so many decades.</p><p>I&#39;ve had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner&#39;s girlfriends, and he of course was much older than me, but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.</p><p>From age 16, I lived and breathed wine. I read every magazine and book about wine.</p><p>IQ is a commodity, data is a commodity. I&#39;m far more interested in watching people interact at a restaurant with their smartphone. We can all read &#39;Tech Crunch,&#39; &#39;Ad Age.&#39; I would rather be living in the trenches. I would rather be going to Whole Foods in Columbus Circle to watch people shop with their smartphones.</p><p>Genius worship is the inevitable sign of an uncreative age.</p><p>I appreciate and enjoy my age.</p><p>I&#39;ve been going through photos of my mother, looking back on her life and trying to put it into context. Very few people age gracefully enough to be photographed through their aging.</p><p>I am rediscovering the whole sexual dimension of life at the age of 86, really. And that also means discovering the feminine. So the whole of this dimension, which I had been seeking for a very long time, is now sort of opening itself up to me.</p><p>I think all writers of my age who are brought up on films probably by the age of 16 have seen many more films than they have read classics of literature. We can&#39;t help but be influenced by film. Film has got some great tricks that it&#39;s taught writers.</p><p>Some broad themes brought me where I am today. At a very young age, my hobby became thinking and finding connections.</p><p>I think you have to be a little bit strict. You can&#39;t be friend and their parent in a lot of situations, especially in this day and age where it&#39;s so dangerous for kids. So there&#39;s a bit of sternness, I guess, in the way I raise my kids.</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s there was so little decent fiction for young people, but we&#39;re now in a golden age that shows no sign of fading. Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling, Lemony Snicket are only three of the best known among a good number of equals.</p><p>I want to sell to people my own age, because that&#39;s the way I write songs.</p><p>You get to a certain age and you just want to prove that you can still rock - that you&#39;ve still got it.</p><p>I always thought that I might retire from any form of sexuality by the age of 40 and just become a dignified older person.</p><p>It&#39;s only at this age that I can say the word &#39;art&#39; without flinching.</p><p>Well, once you&#39;ve resigned yourself to the fact that you are the more mature pop performer and you&#39;re past the age you ever thought you would do it, you might as well do it as long as you can. As long as I can still lift a microphone, then I&#39;ll do it, you know.</p><p>I hope to have one more boxing match at the age of 55. Given that demographic at the age of 55 to 65, you&#39;ve got to make a statement with your life. Otherwise, you are just existing.</p><p>I think it&#39;s hard, the fact that there&#39;s a certain age that we can&#39;t have kids anymore.</p><p>While I had often said that I wanted to die in bed, what I really meant was that in my old age I wanted to be stepped on by an elephant while making love.</p><p>I basically started playing violin at the age of six. That lasted about three years because my previous teacher died and the second teacher didn&#39;t really know how to successfully get me going.</p><p>Age acquires no value save through thought and discipline.</p><p>I&#39;ve had to be a man since I was 12 or 13. I had a job. And I was playing the piano for people twice my age. Handling responsibility is what makes a man a man.</p><p>Old age isn&#39;t so bad when you consider the alternative.</p><p>Up until age 40, most men are just not as mature as women. So, it makes sense that a lot of women date up in age a bit.</p><p>Think back to yourself at age 18. I know I was mighty different than the Patti I am today. As we grow up, we grow out of our haircuts, our apartments and - often times - our romantic decisions.</p><p>I was well motivated. What I wanted to do was work for myself. I had twenty two jobs before I started my business at the age of twenty three and I didn&#39;t want one more boss telling me what to do. So I was motivated simply because I didn&#39;t want a boss.</p><p>Regardless of age, regardless of position, regardless of the business we happen to be in, all of us need to understand the importance of branding. We are CEOs of our own companies: Me, Inc. To be in business today, our most important job is to be head marketer for the brand called You.</p><p>An age which is incapable of poetry is incapable of any kind of literature except the cleverness of a decadence.</p><p>I&#39;ve always felt that sexuality is a really slippery thing. In this day and age, it tends to get categorized and labeled, and I think labels are for food. Canned food.</p><p>There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility.</p><p>Each age tries to form its own conception of the past. Each age writes the history of the past anew with reference to the conditions uppermost in its own time.</p><p>People quit on jobs. They quit on marriages. They quit on school. There&#39;s an immediacy of this day and age that doesn&#39;t lend itself to being committed to anything.</p><p>I nearly died of double bronchial pneumonia at the age of five.</p><p>The wonderful thing about age is that your knees don&#39;t work as well, you can&#39;t run down steps quite as easily and obviously you can&#39;t lift heavy weights. But your mind doesn&#39;t feel any different.</p><p>In a secular age, an authentic miracle must purport to be a hoax, in order to gain credit in the world.</p><p>But I think it&#39;s a little different in Europe, because 40 is really the best age for a woman. That&#39;s when we hit our peak and become this ripe fruit.</p><p>My mother was 45 when she had me, so when I was in high school my parents were the same age as my friends&#39; grandparents.</p><p>In the age of television, image becomes more important than substance.</p><p>Just call me a family man and an actor who digs his whole scene, side interests and all. Just say I feel mighty good at the ripe old age of 27.</p><p>Maybe back in the day you didn&#39;t need to be the greatest looking to be on TV and you didn&#39;t need to speak the best, but in this day and age, I think you need to be the package. You need to look the part for your sponsors, you need to be able to speak the part for the media and to big CEOs.</p><p>The culture of independent film criticism has totally gone down the drain and this seems to come with the territory of the consumer age that we are now living in.</p><p>There are only three things that can kill a farmer: lightning, rolling over in a tractor, and old age.</p><p>They say eyes clear with age.</p><p>Growing up on stage, I was introduced to makeup at a young age and I will never forget the first time I tried on a L&#39;Oreal Paris iconic lipstick - it was instant glamour and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since.</p><p>I don&#39;t mind my age.</p><p>Despite what anti-aging ads say, growing older can be better. I feel better in my skin, 100 percent. You have greater effects of gravity, but the better sense of yourself you have is something I wouldn&#39;t trade. Women who lie about their age - &#39;why?&#39;</p><p>For the moment I prefer to be a beautiful woman of my age than try desperately to look 30.</p><p>It&#39;s a little silly to finally learn how to write at this age. But I long ago realized I was secretly sincere.</p><p>It&#39;s not always possible to sit down and eat at home in this day and age of fast-paced living, but if you are going to eat out, do so as a family and support all the great local places in your areas. I&#39;ll still eat at the same diner I did as a kid with my parents.</p><p>I worked hard in gymnastics since the time I was six years old until I retired at 23 years of age.</p><p>I did successfully kick tobacco at the age of 34. I smoked for like 20 years, from 14 to 34.</p><p>India saw from the beginning, and, even in her ages of reason and her age of increasing ignorance, she never lost hold of the insight, that life cannot be rightly seen in the sole light, cannot be perfectly lived in the sole power of its externalities.</p><p>Back in the 1960s, I saw Peter, Paul and Mary. I was at that age, about 14, and I was mesmerized.</p><p>For me from a pretty young age up until about 21 years old hallucinogenics had a huge place in my life.</p><p>A sense of freedom is something that, happily, comes with age and life experience.</p><p>Writers obviously have to bear witness to the harsh face of the age.</p><p>Stop living a day at a time and stop worrying about age.</p><p>Young women from a very young age are taught that life will be easier if you can just turn on the charming smile and say very little and be complacent and docile and sweet.</p><p>I started writing when I had three kids under the age of 4. I used to write every ten minutes I got to sit in front of a computer. Now, when I have more time, I function the same way: if it&#39;s writing time, I write.</p><p>I&#39;m never overawed by a situation and I think that&#39;s because I&#39;ve always looked several years older than I am. So because people were treating me like I was 40 when I was 29, I&#39;ve always felt in control of a situation. People used to say, when you&#39;re 32, you&#39;ll look 32. I&#39;m still waiting for that moment, where my age catches up with my appearance.</p><p>I am 54 and age is slowly writing itself on my face.</p><p>I envy the sensibility in Europe, appreciating beauty in women as they age. I&#39;m going to go that way. I might dye my gray hair for a bit, but beyond that the buck stops. I&#39;m not having any work done.</p><p>It was Julie Burchill who decreed that, beyond a certain age, a man should not be seen in a leather jacket.</p><p>As a result of the digital age and the decline of first-class mail, there is no question that the Postal Service must change and develop a new business model.</p><p>I&#39;ve watched my peers get better with age and hoped that would happen with me.</p><p>I never wanted to do TV. I just did what I was trained to do through the Special Forces, and I&#39;ve been doing that from a very young age.</p><p>Here&#39;s a proposal, offered only partly in jest: no resident of the United States, whether born here or abroad, should get to be a citizen until age 18, at which time each such resident has to take a test.</p><p>Second to agriculture, humbug is the biggest industry of our age.</p><p>When it comes down to it, it&#39;s about who you know, and who&#39;s a fan. It&#39;s about whether you&#39;re the right age, whether you&#39;re hot or not, whether the studio is into you or not.</p><p>Another principle is, the deepest affections of our hearts gather around some human form in which are incarnated the living thoughts and ideas of the passing age.</p><p>My acting career began at age three and my parents got me into it. I was in a McDonald&#39;s commercial.</p><p>I think that age as a number is not nearly as important as health. You can be in poor health and be pretty miserable at 40 or 50. If you&#39;re in good health, you can enjoy things into your 80s.</p><p>I just yesterday returned from a trip where I photographed a woman with two children whom I photographed first when she was the age of the older of the two children.</p><p>You live in a deranged age, more deranged that usual, because in spite of great scientific and technological advances, man has not the faintest idea of who he is or what he is doing.</p><p>To write a story about New York that only deals with people in your age and socioeconomic bracket, that feels dishonest to me. So much of New York comes from everyone bumping into each other.</p><p>My mother inspired me to treat others as I would want to be treated regardless of age, race or financial status.</p><p>And from the first time I picked up a basketball at age eight - I had a lot of difficulty when I first picked up a basketball, because I was a scrub - there were things that I liked about it.</p><p>Right up until the time I retired at age 37, I felt like there were still things that I could do better.</p><p>In 1981, at age 31, I was voted the best player in basketball, and the most valuable player in the league.</p><p>The great thing about arriving at this age is that I don&#39;t even care about my career anymore.</p><p>Almost all of your life is lived by the seat of your pants, one unexpected event crashing into another, with no pattern or reason, and then you finally reach a point, around my age, where you spend more time than ever looking back. Why did this happen? Look where that led? You see the shape of things.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been intrigued by color and by interesting hair. I was one of those weird little girls doing my own hair at the age of 9. I was, like, getting weird gels and new brushes and cornrow holders. I would tweak and perm at the age of 13.</p><p>There are no college courses to build up self-esteem or high school or elementary school. If you don&#39;t get those values at a early age, nurtured in your home, you don&#39;t get them.</p><p>The freethinking of one age is the common sense of the next.</p><p>If children are not introduced to music at an early age, I believe something fundamental is actually being taken from them.</p><p>Middle age is when your broad mind and narrow waist begin to change places.</p><p>As an American, you have a right to good health care that is effective, accessible, and affordable, that serves you from infancy through old age, that allows you to go to practitioners and facilities of your choosing, and that offers a broad range of therapeutic options.</p><p>Women would be disproportionately affected by the privatization of social security. It is one of the most important safety nets for American women in old age, or in times of disability, to insure financial income for their families.</p><p>Low levels of vitamin D in the population as a whole suggest that most people need to take a vitamin D supplement. This may be especially true for seniors, as the ability to synthesize vitamin D in the skin declines with age.</p><p>Part of the reason I sort of shot out like a cannon out of Michigan and left home at such an early age is because I had to feel independent.</p><p>I think that everyone at any age should ask themselves, &#39;where do I want to be today, where do I want to be tomorrow, and where do I want to be in a hundred years?&#39; We all have clear answers to those questions. We only have so much time. It&#39;s a real shame if we don&#39;t spend our lives trying to do that.</p><p>My parents got married late and they had kids late, so I never felt a social or cultural thing to be married or pregnant or a homeowner by a certain age.</p><p>I&#39;m a pretty big dork. It&#39;s crazy. I&#39;m one of those people who grew up with all kinds of musicals, but I was right at that age where &#39;Rent&#39; was a big deal for me and for my friends.</p><p>My parents were really, really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug. They would drive me down to New York if there were auditions. When I was 12, I did this show on Broadway called &#39;High Society,&#39; so we moved to New York for the run of that.</p><p>I was very sexual from a very young age.</p><p>It is a sobering thought that when Mozart was my age, he had been dead for two years.</p><p>And I&#39;m not as young as I once was. At my age, I don&#39;t have time to be bored.</p><p>I was drafted into the Army when I was 19 and came out at age 22. Most people that I knew didn&#39;t think they&#39;d come home alive. I didn&#39;t think I would either, so I was happy when I did.</p><p>One already feels like an anachronism, writing novels in the age of what-ever-this-is-the-age-of, but touring to promote them feels doubly anachronistic. The marketplace is showing an increasing intolerance for the time-honored practice of printing information on paper and shipping it around the country.</p><p>To own the dominant, or only, newspaper in a mid-sized American city was, for many decades, a kind of license to print money. In the Internet age, however, no one has figured out how to rescue the newspaper in the United States or abroad.</p><p>I grew up loving horses. I was relatively obsessed, starting with my rocking horse at age 2, all the way through my painting and drawing phase.</p><p>I was equally in love with singing and acting from an early age.</p><p>You can construct the character of a man and his age not only from what he does and says, but from what he fails to say and do.</p><p>I never played much golf as a kid. I caddied quite a bit but never got serious into golf until about age 15.</p><p>These days too many of us seem inclined to cover our ears, close our eyes, and blindly follow the most narrow, conservative tenets of religion or else seek comfort in the ancient traditions of New Age ritual.</p><p>There is no age, height, or weight requirement to skate. It is good exercise no matter what your age is. If you want to be competitive, most start young. But, I practice with many adult competitors.</p><p>I remember when I was 6 years old and my brother used to go seek out guys that were 13 to come over and play football against me while he was the &#39;permanent quarterback.&#39; I didn&#39;t know exactly what the age difference was, but I was already playing against older guys.</p><p>Well, my son really loves wildlife. And everytime he draws a polar bear I want to tell him there probably won&#39;t any by the time... he&#39;s my age. That&#39;s kinda hard to deal with.</p><p>To be perfectly honest, I think that as I&#39;m growing older, I&#39;m just growing more impatient. I&#39;ll be very happy if at some point people say, &#39;Michael&#39;s grown wiser and softer in his old age.&#39; But we&#39;ll have to wait and see what my next project is.</p><p>A woman my age is not supposed to be attractive or sexually appealing. I just get kinda tired of that.</p><p>Listen, in England people are already writing their memoirs at the age of 23.</p><p>I was apprehensive. I feared every time I talked about poetry, it would be filtered through the lens of race, sex, and age.</p><p>Everyone takes pause at 40. It&#39;s the age you have to assess everything in your life. It&#39;s the fictitious marker that&#39;s always coming up when you&#39;re young. The world really does look at you to kind of have it together by 40, and be successful by 40. Whatever success means.</p><p>I started out modeling at a young age and surrounded myself with different brilliant minds. I have so many people to get educated from, and I&#39;ve been a sponge.</p><p>People say women shouldn&#39;t have long hair over a certain age, but I&#39;ve never done what everyone says.</p><p>We tend to think of age only in time, but I don&#39;t think it has much to do with time at all there&#39;s a whole load of other things. I&#39;ve met 16-year-olds who are old and 90-year-olds who are young.</p><p>It looks good when you see someone kicking at the age of 51 with no double. It&#39;s kinda cool for people to know that past 50 we can keep flexible.</p><p>The second album was emotionally exhausting and my life felt like it had become very serious at a very young age.</p><p>I never felt totally, 100%, patriotically English... I&#39;d seen a lot of the world by an early age - sort of spent a lot of time traveling around Lebanon and I&#39;d seen Babylon, and Damascus, and all sorts of places in the Middle East by the time I was ten. Then we&#39;d return to Ruslip in West London... Done a fair bit of traveling really.</p><p>The first feminine feature that goes, with advancing age, is the neck.</p><p>You just never know when you&#39;re living in a golden age.</p><p>We now have an opportunity, though, to do something we didn&#39;t do in the industrial age, and that is to get a leg up on this, to bring the public in quickly, to have an informed debate.</p><p>I&#39;ve spent as much as 30 grand on a watch but it&#39;s not about flaunting my wealth. I don&#39;t have many extravagances but watches are my biggest one. I must have 30 of them now. I&#39;ve been collecting since the age of nine, when I won a black TAG in a karting event.</p><p>We were making the first step out of the age of chemistry and physics, and into the age of biology.</p><p>I feel like women are asked their age more than men.</p><p>Even in this day and age, if you&#39;re not married, there are people who are like, &#39;Awww! Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll happen for you someday.&#39;</p><p>For students today, only 10 percent of children from working-class families graduate from college by the age of 24 as compared to 58 percent of upper-middle-class and wealthy families.</p><p>I have worked very hard on being aware of my childhood but moving forward and not letting it bring me down emotionally. That is a hard thing - especially when you have children of your own and you remember what happened to you at that age.</p><p>Traveling to Russia and Germany and being able to see the world at a young age was really cool for me, and I really liked that.</p><p>I vividly remember being 14. That was the age when I started to get happy: I started being a writer and stopped being a loser.</p><p>The balance of private good and general welfare is at the bottom of civilized morals but the morals of the Heroic Age are founded on individuality, and on nothing else.</p><p>I also find it interesting that a lot of people in their 30s are not married and don&#39;t have kids. There are a lot of people in this age bracket that are out there dating and trying to find love. And I never thought that at my age I would be.</p><p>The reason can only be this: heroic poetry depends on an heroic age, and an age is heroic because of what it is, not because of what it does.</p><p>The 19th century was the age of Individualism the 20th and 21st are the ages of Socialism.</p><p>We live in an age of mediocrity.</p><p>I gambled and I lost. I failed in securing my options for this choice for myself, but I succeeded in verifying the Dark Age is still with us.</p><p>I always looked really young for my age. And once I hit 23, 24 and 25, I was then allowed to play the cool 18-year-olds and stuff.</p><p>I want to be age appropriate. I don&#39;t want to be that girl you see walking away and she looks 25 and then she turns around and she looks 90.</p><p>When I was at school, I was in choirs more than anything else, from a very young age, about 9 years old. And then I started taking drum lessons.</p><p>I was always obsessed with being famous. I had Marilyn Monroe paper dolls as a child, and I was always obsessed with her. I&#39;ve just been really driven in that direction, and none of my friends were. So, I don&#39;t know what put that bug in me at a young age.</p><p>All my early school reports from the age of 5 were &#39;Daniel must learn not to distract others.&#39;</p><p>At the age of 11 I was about 6 ft. tall and my voice had completely broken. That caused problems. I was this gangly, spotty, very unattractive kid. I wasn&#39;t cool and I wasn&#39;t a nerd. I didn&#39;t even want to fit in with anyone.</p><p>I&#39;ve always tried to do my very best, and I want to be the very best age, whatever age I am.</p><p>I never quite toed the line. I was a bit disruptive. All my early school reports from the age of 5 were &#39;Daniel must learn not to distract others.&#39; And now, that&#39;s what I do for a living.</p><p>One problem with age is that patience begins to ebb.</p><p>Men of my age live in a state of continual desperation.</p><p>Starting a new retirement plan for those below a certain age is something tens of millions of Americans have already been through at work.</p><p>Anybody under the age of forty knows hip-hop, gospel and R&amp;ampB pretty well, and it&#39;s all a part of what we consider to be &#39;black music.&#39; There is a natural synergy between the three.</p><p>Well, Jeff Buckley for me is one of the greatest singers I&#39;ve ever heard. And the reason why is he has an amazing range, amazing emotional power in his voice. And the music he put around it also just had this passion and this soul to it and this spirit to it that very few artists have, and he passed at a very young age.</p><p>It&#39;s getting better generally, daily, especially in TV, for women in acting and age and looks count less. As more women come into the business. Change of any sort takes a long time to happen.</p><p>I think the most exciting thing is that you expect people our age to know the music, but actually a lot of kids know the music, and if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that&#39;s the important part, not the mop-tops or whatever.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter what color, sex, religion, age, sexual orientation, etc., everyone should have the same freedoms and liberties.</p><p>Childhood itself is scarcely more lovely than a cheerful, kindly, sunshiny old age.</p><p>In my older age, I&#39;ve learned to take things slower, because I used to be that total-fall-in-love-after-a-day guy.</p><p>You watch yourself age and it&#39;s hard to feel like a sex symbol.</p><p>I like to be alone so I can write. But focus can hurt you. I don&#39;t want to be some stress casualty in early middle age.</p><p>I&#39;d always thought the Rats were good fun, but one of the very nice things about being of Saga age is that I can actually look back and think, When I was younger I was in a great band. It was always a collective thing.</p><p>I do think I feel it but you don&#39;t think you are cause at a certain time you are no age but you don&#39;t think you are anything. You feel the life you have lived. I feel that. It&#39;s been a long fifty years.</p><p>The crucial task of old age is balance: keeping just well enough, just brave enough, just gay and interested and starkly honest enough to remain a sentient human being.</p><p>My first job was in retail at the age of 14, and I have worked in the industry ever since.</p><p>I believed my story would be helpful to young women my daughter&#39;s age, who are still in the process of forming themselves as women, and in need of encouragement to remain true to themselves.</p><p>Old age and sickness bring out the essential characteristics of a man.</p><p>We hold that the most wonderful and splendid proof of genius is a great poem produced in a civilized age.</p><p>The age we live in is a busy age in which knowledge is rapidly advancing towards perfection.</p><p>In a spiritually sensitive culture, then, it might well be that age is something to be admired or envied.</p><p>What though youth gave love and roses, Age still leaves us friends and wine.</p><p>If there is anything I would do differently in my life, it is that I would study business more. I&#39;m trying to teach my daughter Chloe at an early age about investing and money so she&#39;s not afraid of it.</p><p>Any young man who is unmarried at the age of twenty one is a menace to the community.</p><p>Time, in general, has always been a central obsession of mine - what it does to people, how it can constitute a plot all on its own. So naturally, I am interested in old age.</p><p>The first crocodile I ever caught was at nine years of age, and it was a rescue.</p><p>It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely.</p><p>Alone we can do so little together we can do so much.</p><p>It&#39;s often just enough to be with someone. I don&#39;t need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both.

Most important thing though is that people there know how to live! In America they&#39;ve forgotten all about it.

I got this package of poems and artwork based around the songs. They&#39;ve got this thing called &#39;Floetry&#39; where they all have to put in artwork. They&#39;ve set up their own competitions and stuff which is kind of amazing.</p><p>I saw &#39;The Artist.&#39; It&#39;s really beautiful and it&#39;s all done to the letter with all the silent film techniques. The costumes were amazing and the dog is so good.</p><p>My siblings and I were friends with the boys who would become our stepbrothers - we grew up on the same street. I feel very special to have these amazing people in my life and if we hadn&#39;t all moved into this big house together I think I would have missed out on that, because we would have drifted apart.</p><p>Singing really is acting.

She&#39;s a phenomenally talented actress and has had a career spanning so many decades.</p><p>I started running outside when I was at &#39;Biggest Loser.&#39; Then I got runner&#39;s knee, and thought I was never going to be able to shake it. When I overcame that and ran the L.A. Marathon, it was such an amazing thing, and now running is such a part of my routine.</p><p>We watch a lot of Discovery Channel, shows like &#39;The Biggest Loser&#39; and even &#39;Amazing Race.&#39; You learn a lot about the world, it&#39;s fun and nobody&#39;s interested in beating anybody down. And then the opposite: I&#39;m a huge fan of &#39;Survivor.&#39;</p><p>Spinning has been such an amazing part of my exercise. I love the music, the energy, and the sweat. It&#39;s a tough class, which makes me feel like I&#39;ve really accomplished something. It&#39;s a great way to burn fat and lean out the body. An all-around win!</p><p>If you think you don&#39;t want to play another psychopath, but the script is amazing, and the director is fantastic, and the story is incredible, then you may end up playing your third psychopath in a row.</p><p>Truthfully, being pregnant is changing me as a person. Each day is part of this amazing journey that has completely shifted the focus of my life and made me reevaluate my personal and professional goals.</p><p>Strangely enough, when the Sugababes&#39; &#39;Freak Like Me&#39; went to number 1, which was built around my &#39;Are &#39;Friends&#39; Electric&#39; song, I had another song called &#39;Rip&#39; go to number 1 in the Kerrang TV chart, so I was pulling new people in from very different areas of musical interest. That was quite an amazing week.</p><p>I&#39;m a big fan of Mashable and TechCrunch and other outlets like that, but TechMeme obviously does an amazing job of aggregating.</p><p>My daughter is in love with Adele. She listens to her every day. To see someone with that much passion and soul move a 9-year-old is amazing and it&#39;s magical.</p><p>I think having children is the most amazing thing.</p><p>I put the costume on and said &#39;It&#39;s not very comfortable, but it looks amazing,&#39; so it&#39;s all good.</p><p>My mother is the coolest, most amazing person I know.</p><p>There are some amazing stories from all over this country, where people&#39;s work and contribution has been acknowledged. To be part of that is an absolutely fantastic feeling.</p><p>I decided to give acting a serious, committed try, and soon after, I read the script for &#39;Lovely and Amazing.&#39; The story was beautiful and honest, and the characters struggled with the same insecurities many women - including me - face. I didn&#39;t think I had a chance in hell of being in the film, but I knew I had to go for it.</p><p>I really would love to do a piece like Julia Roberts or Charlize Theron in &#39;Erin Brockovich&#39; or &#39;North Country.&#39; They were both so amazing and so inspiring. I would love to touch someone in the way their performances touched me.</p><p>I&#39;m an actor, so sometimes there are moments where I think about everything that&#39;s happening and I want to cry. I&#39;m doing what I love and I will be doing it for a very, very long time - and it&#39;s amazing. A lot of people don&#39;t get to do that.</p><p>I have a full life: I have two amazing kids, I have great friends, great family. And right now, that&#39;s plenty for me to manage. A new relationship just seems like way too much work.</p><p>I&#39;ve worked on films where the budgets are almost limitless and you&#39;re in trailers that are bigger than a hotel room. You&#39;re taken care of and the food is amazing, the quality of the job is amazing and then you work on smaller things but it never dictates my happiness or my willingness to go to work.</p><p>It is amazing to think after all that has happened in this country in the last few years, the last few decades, that so many people have this blind faith that government is our friend and therefore, so we don&#39;t need protections against it.</p><p>Once the kids are in school, it&#39;s amazing what you can do.</p><p>The feeling of your baby taking nourishment from your body for the first time is amazing, and it remains the most touching moment of my life.</p><p>Growing up in New York has influenced my style so much, and I have an amazing relationship with my stylist, Estee Stanley. We have so much fun with the whole process. She picks out dresses, I try things on and play dress up, and we get creative to see what works.</p><p>Every now and then, I have blissful moments of thanking God for all the amazing things that are happening. When I leave the White House after just meeting Obama or when I see my face on the cover of &#39;Rolling Stone&#39; or when I meet someone who tells me that their daughter is inspired by me, those are moments that are incredibly joyful.</p><p>I&#39;m overjoyed and beyond honored to be a part of the L&#39;Oreal Paris family. I&#39;m such a fan of L&#39;Oreal Paris not just for all of their amazing products, but for what they stand for.</p><p>I got fitter when I did &#39;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.&#39; I wore a loincloth - that&#39;s a lot of motivation!</p><p>Of course this is Vegas and it is the melting pot for all over the world, but people from all over the world know Donny and Marie. It is amazing. I have been in the business a long time to realize careers can be fleeting. Five years is a long career nowadays for some people, and here we are still going strong after 40 years.</p><p>Working with amazing people, you continue to learn and develop yourself, as an actor and as a person.</p><p>I never travel without my Stetson, but the more I wear it the more I realise that no one wears hats any more. When I was a kid everybody wore hats, especially in Texas, but I get off the plane in Dallas now and I&#39;m the only guy with a hat. It&#39;s amazing.</p><p>As his partner on this amazing journey, I can tell you Mitt Romney was not handed success. He built it.</p><p>And I thought, when I have kids, that&#39;s the sort of well told, silly, and fun fairy tale that I would want to take them to. But it was an amazing experience. And I think Shrek is a real classic, a fairy tale classic.</p><p>The overall physical demand that Iraq has is pretty amazing. It&#39;s 130 degrees, and the soldiers are carrying about 100 pounds of extra gear. It&#39;s a pretty rigorous schedule and routine for them.</p><p>I work with all these amazing voice actors that do a kajillion voices.</p><p>You have to wait for a big star to come in and generate interest on a project, and now that has become me, which is an amazing blessing.</p><p>We are on the precipice of a crisis, a Constitutional crisis. The checks and balances, which have been at the core of this Republic, are about to be evaporated by the nuclear option. The checks and balances that say if you get 51% of the vote, you don&#39;t get your way 100% of the time. It is amazing, it&#39;s almost a temper tantrum.</p><p>I mean, there are some amazing storytelling being done on the small screen right now. That&#39;s what so cool about being in television right now. Studios, networks are starting to throw more resources, better writers, more production values... and to be part of that is awesome.</p><p>I love vintage shopping, I think it&#39;s really fun. And I love the feeling of finding the most amazing piece for less.</p><p>It&#39;s been such a deep and amazing journey for me, getting close to John Keats, and also I love Shelley and Byron. I mean, the thing about the Romantic poets is that they&#39;ve got the epitaph of romantic posthumously. They all died really young, and Keats, the youngest of them all.</p><p>In football you always get judged on your last game. Whoever you are, or how amazing you are, it&#39;s the last game that everyone has seen.</p><p>I just want to be a part of great stories, whether I&#39;m part of an amazing ensemble cast or I&#39;m leading it or the antagonist or whatever.</p><p>The last real movie stars were probably Redford and Newman. And things were different then. There wasn&#39;t this amazing amount of magazines and information about them.</p><p>There are so many different people that I&#39;ve emulated vocally. In the rock world - Sebastian Bach, Vince Neil, Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant. They all had amazing vocal talent.</p><p>When I&#39;m doing a film, I love getting together after work with my costars. But we get back to L.A. and I&#39;m like, &#39;I don&#39;t want to go to a club with you, dude. I mean, I think you&#39;re rad, and if you want to come play Scrabble with me, that&#39;s amazing.&#39;</p><p>I saw Ellen and my knees were weak. It was amazing. And it was very hard for me to get her out of my mind after that. Then when I saw her that night, we started talking, and that&#39;s that.</p><p>Politically, Obama&#39;s amazing streak of self-destructing opponents who have lain beneath his feet during his unlikely political career appears to be holding.</p><p>I know some of my parents&#39; friends think &#39;Little Britain&#39; is in incredibly poor taste. But swimming the Channel? You can&#39;t really say anything negative about that, can you? There&#39;s nothing better than making your parents happy. The glee on my father&#39;s face that day was amazing.</p><p>I run from Horatio Street down just past Battery Park City and back. It&#39;s amazing to run and see the Statue of Liberty and the ferries coming in. People think if you&#39;re not near Central Park, there&#39;s nowhere to go, but there&#39;s a whole ecosystem happening down here.</p><p>I thought, after the Pulitzer, at least nothing will surprise me quite that much in my life. And another one happened. It was quite amazing.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing how coke encompasses everything in your life. Addicts cannot confront life because they only think of their next hit. I ruined life for my parents, my sister and all my friends.</p><p>It&#39;s kind of amazing how popular &#39;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#39; is. What other show can boast such an annoyingly sincere cast of doctors, sniveling through such perfunctory love triangles?</p><p>Twilight&#39; is such an amazing project, and I think it opened up doors for all of us cast members.;Kellan Lutz;amazing 2293;I finish so many books it&#39;s amazing. I&#39;m also doing Rosetta Stone, learning some French.;Kellan Lutz;amazing 2294;I was blessed, because I come from a family where they knock you down before you float away. I have a lot of brothers who just make sure we have our feet on the ground, and my mom is a rock star. She is an amazing mother.;Kellan Lutz;amazing 2295;When we&#39;re on set, we kind of joke around, and when we&#39;re rehearsing, we change up the scenes and make each other laugh. We lighten up the mood. The blooper reel is going to be amazing on &#39;New Moon.</p><p>Motion capture is amazing. I prefer it. You wear a &#39;Power Ranger&#39;-esque suit, you have tape balls on you, you have 60 cameras around you capturing your every movement and there&#39;s no hair, no makeup.</p><p>For &#39;Around the World in 80 Plates&#39; we got to travel all over, having what was like a cross between a culinary competition and races. And in each country we had a chef Ambassador. We went to London, Barcelona, Bologna, Hong Kong, Thailand, Morocco... It was amazing.</p><p>I go to Saint Barth in the French West Indies for two weeks each year. That place is amazing. Amazing people, beautiful beaches, great wine, wonderful harbors... It&#39;s incredibly romantic.</p><p>I was homeless for a little bit. I was on people&#39;s couches, but it was an amazing journey. I got to make people laugh all the way.</p><p>God bless you if you have one child, but I don&#39;t think anybody should have just one child. Everybody needs a sibling. I have siblings, and I have so many amazing, precious memories with my siblings. I don&#39;t know what I would do if I had been an only child.</p><p>I got amazing training both with Theatre Sports... back in Edmonton, Alberta - I can&#39;t give those people enough credit - and the daytime drama I did. Incredible training, both of them.</p><p>My parents were kind of like me in that they had tons and tons of weird, amazing stuff.</p><p>I have a really amazing fan club, it&#39;s contemporary but it&#39;s a little bit old school. There&#39;s a lot of connection. I have a fan club president who really responds to people.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing how much you can absorb on a film set.</p><p>I just think we&#39;re living in a time of massive, amazing change, like the Industrial Revolution on acid.</p><p>Theatre, when it is at its best, takes a lot of beating - the live experience and the shared collective experience of live storytelling is really special when it is good. Particularly here in New York because the audiences are amazing, very vocal and very engaged, and that makes theatre very exciting.</p><p>As a young black boy, it made me proud to see black leaders that did something amazing and made the world change.</p><p>Well, Jeff Buckley for me is one of the greatest singers I&#39;ve ever heard. And the reason why is he has an amazing range, amazing emotional power in his voice. And the music he put around it also just had this passion and this soul to it and this spirit to it that very few artists have, and he passed at a very young age.</p><p>I love Louisiana. It&#39;s amazing.</p><p>I&#39;d said to my sweetheart a couple of days before that the SAG and Spirit Award nomination was amazing and I had no attachment to the Academy Award.

I think this is an amazing suit, don&#39;t you think?</p><p>Walmart is an amazing story of entrepreneurship and, as one of the world&#39;s most powerful brands, touches millions of lives every day.</p><p>I think what&#39;s really amazing is that given the scale of the web and getting the compute power we have today, we&#39;re starting to see things that appear intelligent but actually aren&#39;t semantically intelligent.</p><p>Linda Georgian is a wonderful psychic. She can do amazing things.</p><p>The resilience of these people is amazing. I am a great believer that the sooner we get things up and running in terms of sport in this area, the better.</p><p>I walk into a kids&#39; store, and it&#39;s amazing, the types of instruments - little squeaky things, rattling things, spinning tops.</p><p>The human body and mind are tremendous forces that are continually amazing scientists and society. Therefore, we have no choice but to keep an open mind as to what the human being can achieve.</p><p>Going to a concert is so overwhelming and the energy is amazing.</p><p>I look up to Mick Jagger because he&#39;s an amazing performer and he&#39;s such an individual. I respect him and admire him eternally.</p><p>I have two younger sisters and I&#39;m such an advocate of owning who you are as a person. Don&#39;t be ashamed or intimidated. Never feel like you are not amazing.</p><p>Whether it&#39;s 18 years old or 40 years old, we think we know what&#39;s going on. But if you&#39;re lucky enough to continue the journey, its amazing how we keep learning how much we didn&#39;t know.</p><p>The business that people do in LA on the social level is amazing. You go to a restaurant, bump into this guy or that guy. The next day you get a call, and they want you in their movie.</p><p>The current Babe Ruth of improv? Sacha Baron Cohen. He&#39;s pretty amazing.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing how I can just ramble on for hours, isn&#39;t it? And so unentertaining or uninteresting. But I can ramble on for hours. It&#39;s a sort of terrible gift, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>If my kids are doing well, then my life is going pretty well. And if my kids aren&#39;t doing well, it doesn&#39;t matter how the other elements of my life are. It&#39;s kind of amazing to have a context like that. This is really wonderful.</p><p>My father is an amazing man.</p><p>What makes America amazing is that there have always been men and women of courage who were willing to think more about the future of their children and grandchildren than they did about their own political careers.</p><p>I&#39;m one of those people that thinks the Internet is amazing, and I can&#39;t believe it exists.</p><p>It&#39;s wonderful to be appreciated for being quirky, and to see Zooey Deschanel and the quirky, indie film types get mainstream play is amazing for women, because women are much more complicated than what we&#39;ve see on TV in the past.</p><p>I&#39;ve done my best to work from a place of humility - always looking over your shoulder saying, &#39;Does this suck?&#39; and I think that&#39;s a good way to work. The other way to work is where you start to think, &#39;I&#39;m on fire, I&#39;m amazing!&#39; and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the way to work.</p><p>I was terribly shy when I was growing up, I really wasn&#39;t confident with other people and I think I was always afraid of up or not being this very cool, amazing person that I wanted to be.</p><p>I just believe that the feeling of wonder is amazing. I am pushing myself as far as I can humanly push myself... I can only hope for the best and expect the worse.</p><p>I&#39;m tired of being around men all the time. I&#39;m going to start a band called Skirt with three girls and I&#39;ll play the guitar and sing backing vocals in drag. I went window shopping when I was in New York, saw a lot of amazing dresses.</p><p>Partly because his life ended before the age of 50, Hamilton was defined by the other founding fathers, and he managed, with amazing consistency, to alienate most of them.</p><p>So I won an Oscar. It&#39;s amazing. I&#39;ve got that for the rest of my life for a performance I am proud of. It nearly killed me. I am really proud of the film. That&#39;s it, moving on.</p><p>It&#39;s a melting pot, southern Africa. You find these cultural collisions that result in art and music, and it&#39;s pretty amazing.</p><p>I have a wonderful husband. I have three amazing kids.</p><p>My mom was amazing. She believed in me and we were best friends.</p><p>When Maurice touched a keyboard, it was like something from a movie, magical. He would always give you something from a movie, and you&#39;d go, what did you just play... immediately inspirational writings, amazing. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to miss.</p><p>My dad was working abroad, in Iraq, and he was a doctor. We used to go and visit him, in Baghdad, off and on. For the first ten years of my life, we used to go backwards and forwards to Baghdad, so that was quite amazing. I spent a lot of time traveling around the Middle East.</p><p>Everything has combined to make my life in New York an amazing experience. I told my manager a few years ago that I wanted to move here and try acting in the theater.</p><p>Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored. We had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook&#39;s time than now. It&#39;s amazing.</p><p>I&#39;ve also long since realized that the way to really engage children is to give out prizes it&#39;s amazing how it concentrates their minds.</p><p>When you&#39;re a stay-at-home mother you have to pretend it&#39;s really boring, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s enriching and fulfilling, and an amazing experience. And then when you&#39;re a working mother you have to pretend that you feel guilty all day long.</p><p>My time at Honda was amazing. Some of my best times in Formula One, actually. I might not have won races, just one race, but I had a lot of fun.</p><p>My &#39;Movember&#39; moustache was never going to be as big as Nigel Mansell&#39;s, but I tried my best. The amazing thing is that when you try to grow a moustache, you notice everyone else&#39;s. There are some amazing moustaches on the grid.</p><p>To go to the Oscars for Moneyball - that was pretty amazing. And to be able to go work with Kathryn Bigelow - that&#39;s going to be pretty sweet. Hopefully I don&#39;t have to go back to being a waiter. That&#39;s still my main goal.</p><p>To go to the Oscars for &#39;Moneyball&#39; - that was pretty amazing.</p><p>After I finished high school I went to Hong Kong and Thailand and spent some time there. Just to get that whole experience of being out of the bubble that I was in from high school in Vancouver, to be able to travel around and be on your own was an amazing experience.</p><p>I was dating my first boyfriend in high school for a long time, and we broke up before prom. I hadn&#39;t met anyone else that I really wanted to go with, and my friends have always been amazing. So I went with my friends and got a million photos with them!</p><p>With fitness, I do Bikrams hot yoga. The gym that I have in my building is amazing. I love to do cardio and weights there.</p><p>You know, the reward for &#39;Captain America&#39; is amazing. It&#39;s always fun to see a giant spectacle film and see the fun stuff - the special effects.</p><p>The environmental benefits of hydrogen are also outstanding. When used as an energy source, hydrogen produces no emissions besides water. Zero polluting emissions, an amazing advance over the current sources of energy that we use.</p><p>I&#39;ll always be this crazy, fun person, but when it&#39;s time to get married, I&#39;m going to be an amazing wife.</p><p>The difference between Marilyn Monroe and the early Pamela Anderson is not that great. What&#39;s amazing is that the taste of American men and international tastes in terms of beauty have essentially stayed the same. Styles change, but our view of beauty stays the same.</p><p>I&#39;ve traveled all over the country for years speaking in churches, teaching the Ten Commandments. It&#39;s amazing if 2 percent of any congregation knows the Ten Commandments.</p><p>Shakespeare is all big themes, like the most amazing love, or the most scary war.</p><p>Fatherhood is the most amazing thing that could ever have happened in my life.</p><p>As a kid who wasn&#39;t into sports, at school I felt almost alienated at times, whereas in the theatre community there was this amazing sense of camaraderie. Early on, we would go to rehearsals with my dad and I was like the mascot for the backstage crew. That was a big part of my childhood, so I dreamed of one day doing a play in London.</p><p>It was said Daredevil grew up in Hell&#39;s Kitchen, an amazing name for a neighbourhood. But that opened a Pandora&#39;s box of all the crime stuff I wanted to do. I borrowed liberally from Will Eisner&#39;s &#39;The Spirit&#39; and turned &#39;Daredevil&#39; into a crime comic.</p><p>Comics are so full of amazing work. And I can&#39;t look at a drawing of a woman without thinking of, for instance, Wallace Wood and his amazing way of capturing beauty.</p><p>When you think of what Americans accomplished, building these amazing cities and all the good it&#39;s done in the world, it&#39;s kind of disheartening to hear so much hatred of America, not just from abroad, but internally.</p><p>So when I go home, sometimes, even when I had an amazing game, I always think about what I missed.</p><p>In America, Blackberry Farm in Tennessee is one of the most amazing hotels I&#39;ve had the privilege of staying at.</p><p>It&#39;s better to get the nutrients for healthy skin from food, not supplements. Salmon, walnuts, blueberries, spinach... lots of my favorite foods happen to be amazing for skin too.</p><p>I discovered something amazing, which has caused a lot of controversy - the fountain of youth. I have to keep it a secret!</p><p>Surfing is such an amazing concept. You&#39;re taking on Nature with a little stick and saying, &#39;I&#39;m gonna ride you!&#39; And a lot of times Nature says, &#39;No you&#39;re not!&#39; and crashes you to the bottom.</p><p>When I look into the crowd, I see young and old, black and white - it&#39;s amazing that I&#39;m able to connect with so many different kinds of people.</p><p>We are really on top of one another at the moment and I think it is amazing how we stay so close. Maybe that&#39;s the test. Why not totally put yourself together, rather than always wonder whether you actually like each other?</p><p>Considering the amount of information we&#39;re bombarded by, it&#39;s amazing if a song can transcend time.</p><p>I love insects. They are amazing.</p><p>There are very few dance companies in the world and you have to be phenomenal. You have to not be injured. You have to have a really strong mind to deal with the dance world. People who can do it are amazing to me. You cannot have a life outside of dance.</p><p>Beyonce is the most amazing woman in the world.</p><p>Well, when you&#39;re the youngest of five, parents kind of lose interest more and more through the children. I think my eldest brother was under loads of pressure to do something amazing with his life, but by the time I came around they were like, &#39;Well, let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t kill a guy.&#39;</p><p>I really liked the helicopter pilot in &#39;Dawn of the Dead&#39;, when he gets bitten and comes out of the elevator. That guy was amazing. He did this incredible walk that we didn&#39;t even know about until we started shooting.</p><p>First of all, plain and simple, you have no real idea of what it means to be famous until you become famous. It&#39;s a double-edged sword. Obviously there are a lot of amazing things about fame, but there are also a lot of challenging things about it.</p><p>Stevie Wonder is just one of those guys that completely delivers everything that you want to be true about Stevie Wonder. He&#39;s an amazing human being, and the fairytale exists with that man.</p><p>Nobody has it all, but for me to even come close is amazing.</p><p>When you write biographies, whether it&#39;s about Ben Franklin or Einstein, you discover something amazing: They are human.</p><p>You get moments all the time that kind of make you pinch yourself, some of them make you quite emotional. Winning a BRIT was a big moment because we were just so excited to be at the awards in the first place. Selling out Madison Square Garden was pretty amazing too. Then we woke to the news that our UK tour was sold out. It was crazy.</p><p>The attitude is we live and let live. This is actually an amazing change in values in a rather short time and it&#39;s an example of freedom from religion.</p><p>Yes, the companionship is amazing. You know, you can get that physical attraction that happens is great, but then there&#39;s an awful lot of time and the rest of the day that you have to fill.</p><p>On the surface, rock and roll changes at an amazing pace. The influence of a figure like the Maharishi can appear and disappear in a matter of months. Talk about old fashioned rock and roll finds itself dead before it begins.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing that for actors mostly, it&#39;s a risk to attach yourself to a film that you don&#39;t know whether or not it&#39;s going to even be made and if you sign on, in doing so, who else is going to be in the movie with you.</p><p>I hate the stereotype of the pitfalls of the child actor. There are so many amazing examples - Natalie Portman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore - of people who have made it through.</p><p>I think it&#39;s an amazing quality to be able to roll with the punches and not be totally ruined as a person because life&#39;s been rough for you. That&#39;s a really admirable way to go through your life.</p><p>Like most people my age, my job is the main focus of my life. I don&#39;t have some kind of jet-setting fabulous lifestyle where I&#39;m constantly in situations to acquire amazing anecdotes, that&#39;s it.</p><p>I think that in itself is kind of an amazing achievement to be able to say that your full-time career is in any creative arts, let alone a show that has kept people interested for coming on four seasons and hopefully more.</p><p>I don&#39;t like staying in hotels. I like to be in my own bed. San Diego as a city is really awesome. The only hard part of it for me is that I&#39;m away from my family and my house. But as far as shooting down there, we get amazing locations, and the crew is really, really stellar down there. They are really fun.</p><p>I&#39;d do pretty much anything to get back on stage. I&#39;d like to develop a new musical. I nearly had a heart attack when I heard that they&#39;re developing John Waters&#39; Cry-Baby because that is so amazing and super and wonderful and I wish that I could be involved. But it&#39;s not the right time and I understand that. But I hear things like that and I get that little tingle in my stomach.</p><p>Me and my friend Ioan Gruffudd are like chalk and cheese when it comes to clothes. He lives for his clothes and has an amazing wardrobe. If we&#39;re going out I&#39;ll turn up at his house and say, &#39;I haven&#39;t got anything to wear,&#39; and he&#39;ll tut and sigh and then lend me something swanky.</p><p>Everything that has happened to me has been amazing and surprising.</p><p>And it is very sexy as well: somebody says I&#39;m taking you on a surprise date, you don&#39;t know where you are going and you can&#39;t see and then you put your hand out and there is a tiger. Amazing.</p><p>Housing Works is the coolest thrift store in the world, because not only are they the best thrift store - they&#39;re not the most thrifty thrift store - but they have amazing stuff and all of their proceeds go directly to kids, mostly homeless kids, living with AIDS and HIV in New York, in the metropolitan area.</p><p>I seriously love to cook... My grandmother was an amazing cook. As a kid I used to help her make handmade pasta, Cavatelli and Ravioli. It was one of my favorite things to do. I love the idea of making whatever is in the fridge into something.</p><p>I tend to not watch things that are current. And then if everybody swears it&#39;s amazing then I&#39;ll like watch the whole series in a weekend.</p><p>I think it&#39;s very empowering to be able to have a career and to be a mother. It gives you an amazing sense of self.</p><p>What an amazing opportunity to do something like direct a movie and step out of your creative comfort zone and yet do something that is also so familiar at the same time. I was also just excited to have the chance to direct, which I may never get to do again.</p><p>The magic kit we developed with Idea Village is an extraordinary success in 40,000 stores across America. The TV commercial we shot for it has produced amazing results - unbelievable.</p><p>I had an amazing childhood, lots of love. But my dad worked his tail off, getting up at 4 in the morning and going off at 5, 6 o&#39;clock, yet he always had time to spend with his kids and his wife.</p><p>Magic is the oldest part of the show business profession. It can now be used as a forward-thinking tool to build a child&#39;s confidence. It has been an amazing part in many entertainers&#39; lives, including Steve Martin and the late Johnny Carson.</p><p>I know that my grandfather is 92 years old. And he has seen this country evolve in amazing ways. He looks at South Carolina and he says, wow, what an amazing state that we have the blessing to live within because of the evolution.</p><p>Well, what I love about &#39;80s rock music is the amazing, fantastic melodies.</p><p>You don&#39;t have a lot of time you have to get it right. It&#39;s amazing how they create these episodes in such a short amount of time. They lavish a lot of care and money on each episode, and they just look terrific.</p><p>So it was good for me to play a likable person and it was just an amazing situation to be in.</p><p>My public image is so low-key, but I get to travel the world and still have an audience and it&#39;s really amazing. I don&#39;t take that for granted.</p><p>Being on &#39;Glee&#39; was amazing. I remember my first day on set, my first day I arrived to the set I was in my trailer and all of the actors came and banged on my door - Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Amber Riley, Naya Rivera. They all welcomed me with open arms, so it was a great experience. It felt like family, and I miss them a lot over there.</p><p>That&#39;s an amazing moment, the first time you hear yourself on radio. It&#39;s still thrilling.</p><p>Recently I&#39;ve been doing risottos. Some of them have been amazing. Some of them, not all of them.</p><p>Alexander Gonzalez Inarritu is a great director. He&#39;s the one I first worked with. He&#39;s amazing.</p><p>I suppose it&#39;s amazing when you think how many things people get involved in that don&#39;t work.</p><p>The amount of control you have over somebody if you can monitor internet activity is amazing.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing how quickly people on the internet can pick something up, but it&#39;s also amazing how quickly they can drop it.</p><p>Being a mother is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me in my life.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing what sleep does for your looks.</p><p>I started crying the other day just thinking that the baby is going to leave me soon! You have this relationship with this person in your belly and it&#39;s really amazing.</p><p>My favorite designer is Christian Lacroix, not just because his clothes are amazing and I love them, but because he&#39;s so nice. When I did his fashion show, he was the first one to arrive there and he helped everyone.</p><p>Well, I&#39;d love to work with Kate Winslet - she&#39;s amazing.</p><p>It was amazing and inspiring to see so many people come together through music to aid the great state of Vermont.</p><p>I&#39;ve created, directed and choreographed for Lady Gaga since the beginning, so &#39;Born This Way,&#39; this was musically such an amazing evolution and such a brilliant record. So when she played it for me, it took me a while to find out the visual interpretation that I could give back to her.</p><p>If you love dance and you have the gift of teaching, teaching is super amazing and important because my teachers planted that seed in me. As a teacher you understand the difference or the definition of a Baryshnikov or a Gregory Hines, so teaching is really important and very necessary.</p><p>Choreography is amazing. I&#39;m still a dancer, yet I transitioned into choreography then as a Creative Director. All of these creative elements are brought out of being a dancer. Directing is something that comes out of understanding movement and choreography. Directing movement is directing a dance piece.</p><p>The Dance Scene&#39; is basically the most amazing dance show in the world, and it follows me as a creative director. You see how I maintain that creativity.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2424;I think dance is amazing because what people don&#39;t realize is like when you dance your spirit and your soul get ignited. You&#39;re not only releasing endorphins, but also your spirit is awakening. It makes you feel good and happy.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2425;Pilates is amazing, my posture is so much better and I&#39;m even starting to get muscles on my tummy - it&#39;s incredible.;Kelly Osbourne;amazing 2426;I enjoyed being a teammate of Deion Sanders.

We call it Host in Peril quite often, because people love to see me risk my life or be in danger.;Rick Mercer;amazing 2429;My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through, like when you&#39;re 13 and you think you&#39;re too cool for your parents. When you&#39;re embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.;Hilary Duff;amazing 2430;I guess winning an Oscar is the ultimate dream. A lot of amazing actors go their whole career without even being nominated. So that would definitely be a goal to reach. It&#39;s a difficult one, but I&#39;m aiming for it!;Taylor Lautner;amazing 2431;I wouldn&#39;t be where I am today without the amazing public arts education that I had.;Matthew Morrison;amazing 2432;It&#39;s pretty amazing being me.;Matthew Morrison;amazing 2433;Let me tell you, Barack Obama is the most down dude in the world, but he&#39;s so smart so articulate, such an amazing speaker such a passionate man. He&#39;s humble.;Marlon Wayans;amazing 2434;It&#39;s amazing how fast generations lose sight of other generations. One of the first things the young composers who come to work with me say is that they want to write music people will like, instead of gaining their credentials by being rejected by the audience.;Carlisle Floyd;amazing 2435;I always use my husband&#39;s cocoa butter stuff. He has amazing skin!;Idina Menzel;amazing 2436;My wife is amazing. She had to know she was getting into a heap of trouble when we met.;Taylor Hanson;amazing 2437;I love getting dressed up. Being a pop star is the most brilliant job for that. A lot of girls love shopping, but they might see the most amazing outfit and think, &#39;When am I going to wear that?&#39;, so it&#39;s my duty to exploit the fact I do have events I can wear these things to.;Sophie Ellis-Bextor;amazing 2438;I have an amazing relationship with food.;Katharine McPhee;amazing 2439;I&#39;ve been very fortunate to be able to jump around. I just did this really wonderful film called Map of the World. That was a real, amazing, dramatic story. Then I did a movie called Company Men, a little comedy about the Bay of Pigs.;Sigourney Weaver;amazing 2440;I wore my first pair of Louboutins during this press tour. It was absolutely amazing, they weren&#39;t heels, they were little shoes, but they were velvet and they were blue.;Chloe Moretz;amazing 2441;I jetset around and play these songs and get to hang with some pretty amazing people, then I go home to a really great farm, though actually it&#39;s a disaster area of a farm at the moment.

I wouldn&#39;t trade lives with anyone right now.;Brad Paisley;amazing 2442;It feels amazing to work with writers that write really well.;Giancarlo Esposito;amazing 2443;So, you know, parenting is a very intimate and amazing experience and one of the best experiences of my life.;Uma Thurman;amazing 2444;My sister, she&#39;s amazing.

I had a great family, a typical family with drama in certain areas, and that&#39;s pretty much everywhere in everyone&#39;s life.;Tina Yothers;amazing 2450;It&#39;s nice because success has allowed me to have a blast on stage, to be in the studio with amazing people, but I find it all a bit bizarre.;David Guetta;amazing 2451;It&#39;s amazing what we can get away with and what we can&#39;t. But it&#39;s not for me to decide.;Mike Judge;amazing 2452;I feel fortunate I have this amazing relationship with so many people in America, because I was in their homes at a very private time of day. They probably might have still had their robe on and their slippers and haven&#39;t made the beds.;Joan Lunden;amazing 2453;Science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species. It is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are. I think understanding how the universe was born is very important. It really gives us a perspective on many things.;Yuri Milner;amazing 2454;Isn&#39;t it amazing how celebrity status preempts even the most ingrained hatreds?;Camryn Manheim;amazing 2455;I have experienced some amazing food! Yet when I think about the most luxurious and exquisite meals I have had, visions of simple food made from a few natural ingredients are what most excite me.;Mark Hyman;amazing 2456;I love to go shopping at Target.

They are meeting me and feel that they actually grew up with me. I was with them during their play hours and thinking hours. I was a part of their childhoods. That&#39;s one of the most amazing things.;Mark Goddard;amazing 2459;You know, it&#39;s amazing. I don&#39;t even have a car, would you believe it? I had a motorbike and it got stolen last year. So I&#39;ve got to buy another one of those, I suppose. I can treat myself to that.;Michael Fassbender;amazing 2460;I know this is going to sound corny, but I love my life. I love my baby, so I love getting to wake up with him. And I have the most amazing job, with writing that any actor would love and costars who I can&#39;t wait to see on Monday mornings. And I love coming home to my husband.;Julianna Margulies;amazing 2461;Reba McEntire came through town when I lived in Texas. She had this amazing theatrical show with, like, 13 different wardrobe changes.

I was born in a poor neighborhood and I always, in my heart, felt like it would be amazing to be able to adopt a child from Naples. I could give someone the opportunity I had. I would love to give back in that way and pay it forward.;Giuliana Rancic;amazing 2466;I was writing a scene where a guy was choking another guy to death. You can go online and type &#39;chokeholds&#39; and watch scenes where martial artists choke each other out. You can hear what noises they make when they go unconscious, see how their bodies flop and everything. YouTube is amazing for the more detailed stuff.;Daniel H. Wilson;amazing 2467;That show, &#39;The Amazing Race&#39; - is that about white people?;Zach Galifianakis;amazing 2468;Each of us have things and thoughts and descriptions of an amazing universe in our possession that kings in the 17th Century would have gone to war to possess.;Kary Mullis;amazing 2469;With &#39;The Host,&#39; I think the actors could be really big names. That would be cool. I&#39;d love to see Robert Redford put on a beard and be Jeb he would be amazing... Matt Damon has some very Jared-esque qualities, and then Casey Affleck as Ian and Ben Affleck as Kyle. Imagine the interplay.;Stephenie Meyer;amazing 2470;It&#39;s amazing that no matter how much money you have, you can make some bad decisions, and in five months you&#39;re on the street, begging.;Paz de la Huerta;amazing 2471;I mean, there is amazing amount of oil and gas and other resources out beneath the sea. It&#39;s staggering.;Robert Ballard;amazing 2472;I grew up in a Christian home with amazing parents.;Allyson Felix;amazing 2473;When you&#39;re offered things, it makes it so much easier to be indecisive. And it&#39;s silly because you can pass on some really amazing things.;Alicia Silverstone;amazing 2474;It was amazing to watch him in the darkroom at an advanced age, still get excited when the results were pleasing.

It&#39;s an amazing experience to have had but I can&#39;t see myself being Mother of the House.</p><p>After all these years, it&#39;s still amazing what Obama is allowed to get away with.

That really impressed me - Cecil Taylor is an amazing character... Both his music and the way he approaches the instrument are astonishing.</p><p>My dream career would be to be in things that have real heart and are telling real stories but while doing that, you&#39;re getting really big laughs. I don&#39;t necessarily love the straight crazy comedies. &#39;Caddyshack&#39; is amazing, but there&#39;s not a lot of new &#39;Caddyshack&#39;s.</p><p>I get to travel around the world and meet all of these amazing people, and they&#39;re singing my songs! And to me, that&#39;s crazy.</p><p>In the past few years, we&#39;ve been doing amazing stuff with desserts. Pastry chefs have been using herbs and spices in their desserts.

They&#39;re totally with us.</p><p>I auditioned for &#39;Girls&#39; the fall after I graduated from Yale.

We are surprised at our own versatility in being able to fail in so many different ways.</p><p>I don&#39;t get a chance to do many of my own stunts on &#39;Buffy&#39; - none of us do.

But I would love to do something with the Spice Girls again. I know we would have an amazing time.</p><p>I like what I see now in China, but I think the Japanese are a step ahead into craziness and weirdness.

They&#39;ve been able to keep my sense of humor.</p><p>I just had that conversation this morning with my doctor. I just got back from the hospital a half-hour ago, and nothing will make me happier than to replicate the DNA of my amazing husband.

Half the time, I didn&#39;t know I was doing it.</p><p>New Orleans in an amazing town.</p><p>You can muck around with different guitars for certain bits, but you have to have your own sound. That&#39;s your benchmark, that&#39;s your sound. I also play a Black Beauty. It sounds amazing.</p><p>Any day acting is an amazing day.</p><p>It&#39;s amazing that this is still news to people, but that affects the final outcome of the film.

Maybe he was telling me that he was going.

The lack of angst and anger and emotion is a big positive.</p><p>I did not think that I was angry, but clearly anger was reflected in my writing.

I hope mine will outlive me.</p><p>We can&#39;t forget what happened on May 4th, 1970, when four students gave up their lives because they had the American constitutional right of peaceful protest. They gave up their lives. And to sing that song in that spot on that anniversary was very emotional for us.</p><p>See, the &#39;On the Road&#39; that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it, the bitter honesty, is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary. Back then, there was so much post-Second World War fear that was imposed on everybody - &#39;You must live life this way&#39; - and these guys were bored.</p><p>The chances of a reunion now are less likely. I was thinking of having a 40th anniversary of the band, but now they are really another band, so it&#39;s all a bit weird.</p><p>On this important anniversary, we must remember that while we have come a long way in eliminating barriers, critical work remains to ensure all Americans can live up to their full potential.</p><p>And currently, there are four to five new works in the pipeline for upcoming celebrations such as the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Australian Federation, my 50th Birthday, and Sydney Dance Company&#39;s 25th Anniversary.</p><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Peace Corps as it reached its 45th anniversary on March 1, 2006.</p><p>Perhaps a hundred people assembled one evening, May 15, 1876, at the time when the country was celebrating the hundredth anniversary of its political independence.</p><p>Presently, the Commission for Commemorating 350 Years of American Jewish History has been brought about to encourage and sponsor a variety of historical activities that advance our understanding of the American Jewish experience as it marks this milestone anniversary.</p><p>I am so excited this year getting to play the 85th Anniversary Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Everyone knows on Thanksgiving morning to get up, turn on the TV and watch the parade, so to be an actual participant is going to be fun and I&#39;m looking forward to it. I am gonna have to put on my deer hunting gear, though, to stay warm!</p><p>I was always very grateful to &#39;em and am grateful to &#39;em now. I went back a couple of years ago and did their 20th anniversary show. But the longer I stayed on Hee Haw, the worse things got for me musically.</p><p>June 2005 is the five year anniversary of the debut of Battle Pope.</p><p>It is a matter of public shame that while we have now commemorated our hundredth anniversary, not one in every ten children attending Public schools throughout the colonies is acquainted with a single historical fact about Australia.</p><p>As the third anniversary of the September 11th attacks draws near we must ensure our nation is prepared to handle the continued threat of violence and terrorism on our country.</p><p>This anniversary serves to help remind the American people that, in the wake of one of the greatest political scandals and misuse of power in our history as a nation, scandal produced important reforms that served this nation well for two decades.</p><p>I didn&#39;t make my first solo record until 1981 so I don&#39;t have any 60&#39;s or 70&#39;s recordings but I am working on a large boxed set called DUST to be released next year, the 20th anniversary of my first solo record.</p><p>Actually, the year anniversary of what you just heard, my son Grahame and I are going to be in a play together, and I&#39;m acting for the first time in front of an audience that doesn&#39;t consist of a high school drama class.</p><p>This year, as we celebrate the 230th anniversary of America&#39;s independence, please remember the symbols that are sacred to this country. Fly Old Glory high and show your respect and admiration for this great nation and the values we hold dear.</p><p>On July 18, we will mark the 12th anniversary of the senseless loss of 85 lives in the bombing of the Jewish Cultural Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p><p>I did that Dior Couture 60th anniversary show in July. It took so long to get ready, I think I would have rather been watching.</p><p>I feel there should have been some recognition of the Spice Girls at this year&#39;s 25th anniversary. We flew the flag for Britain around the globe in the 1990s and we achieved a hell of a lot.</p><p>It was very hard for all of us. It&#39;s still very hard. The anniversary of his death just passed, and every single one of his friends, still, after all these years... it&#39;s unbelievable.</p><p>My last trip to New Orleans was for the fifth anniversary of Katrina, and I had the awesome opportunity to bring my family down. We all worked on a house together and met some of the families.</p><p>1 month ago the American people stopped to remember the third anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq war. We thought first and foremost of the selflessness, patriotism and heroism by our troops, our National Guard and Reserves.</p><p>Both the Obama and Romney campaigns said they pulled all their political ads today in observance of the September 11th anniversary. But politics wasn&#39;t very far offstage. The Obama campaign sees foreign policy as an advantage this year.</p><p>The 150th anniversary of Penn State will highlight what is important and good about this distinguished institution and the fine people and research that it produces.</p><p>We shape our buildings thereafter they shape us.</p><p>Whatever good things we build end up building us.</p><p>I don&#39;t build in order to have clients. I have clients in order to build.</p><p>A building has integrity just like a man. And just as seldom.</p><p>Every great architect is - necessarily - a great poet. He must be a great original interpreter of his time, his day, his age.</p><p>We require from buildings two kinds of goodness: first, the doing their practical duty well: then that they be graceful and pleasing in doing it.</p><p>An architect&#39;s most useful tools are an eraser at the drafting board, and a wrecking bar at the site.</p><p>Light, God&#39;s eldest daughter, is a principal beauty in a building.</p><p>Architecture should speak of its time and place, but yearn for timelessness.</p><p>Less is more.</p><p>I don&#39;t divide architecture, landscape and gardening to me they are one.</p><p>Architecture is the art of how to waste space.</p><p>My passion and great enjoyment for architecture, and the reason the older I get the more I enjoy it, is because I believe we - architects - can effect the quality of life of the people.</p><p>Building art is a synthesis of life in materialised form. We should try to bring in under the same hat not a splintered way of thinking, but all in harmony together.</p><p>The higher the building the lower the morals.</p><p>A house is a machine for living in.</p><p>A great building must begin with the unmeasurable, must go through measurable means when it is being designed and in the end must be unmeasurable.</p><p>Those who look for the laws of Nature as a support for their new works collaborate with the creator.</p><p>Architecture is basically a container of something. I hope they will enjoy not so much the teacup, but the tea.</p><p>Architecture is the learned game, correct and magnificent, of forms assembled in the light.</p><p>I believe that the way people live can be directed a little by architecture.</p><p>Space has always been the spiritual dimension of architecture. It is not the physical statement of the structure so much as what it contains that moves us.</p><p>Great buildings that move the spirit have always been rare. In every case they are unique, poetic, products of the heart.</p><p>Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins.</p><p>I try to give people a different way of looking at their surroundings. That&#39;s art to me.</p><p>Architecture is the reaching out for the truth.</p><p>We should concentrate our work not only to a separated housing problem but housing involved in our daily work and all the other functions of the city.</p><p>Make big plans aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die.</p><p>Architecture arouses sentiments in man. The architect&#39;s task therefore, is to make those sentiments more precise.</p><p>To provide meaningful architecture is not to parody history but to articulate it.</p><p>To me, a building - if it&#39;s beautiful - is the love of one man, he&#39;s made it out of his love for space, materials, things like that.</p><p>Form follows profit is the aesthetic principle of our times.</p><p>Warmth isn&#39;t what minimalists are thought to have.</p><p>But the building&#39;s identity resided in the ornament.</p><p>It is not the beauty of a building you should look at its the construction of the foundation that will stand the test of time.</p><p>I hate vacations. If you can build buildings, why sit on the beach?</p><p>A city building, you experience when you walk a suburban building, you experience when you drive.</p><p>Every building is a prototype. No two are alike.</p><p>The loftier the building, the deeper must the foundation be laid.</p><p>I love building spaces: architecture, furniture, all of it, probably more than fashion. The development procedure is more tactile. It&#39;s about space and form and it&#39;s something you can share with other people.</p><p>Architecture is a visual art, and the buildings speak for themselves.</p><p>We build buildings which are terribly restless. And buildings don&#39;t go anywhere. They shouldn&#39;t be restless.</p><p>Architecture tends to consume everything else, it has become one&#39;s entire life.</p><p>What people want, above all, is order.</p><p>The interior of the house personifies the private world the exterior of it is part of the outside world.</p><p>If you give people nothingness, they can ponder what can be achieved from that nothingness.</p><p>Nothing requires the architect&#39;s care more than the due proportions of buildings.</p><p>Proportions are what makes the old Greek temples classic in their beauty. They are like huge blocks, from which the air has been literally hewn out between the columns.</p><p>Architecture is not an inspirational business, it&#39;s a rational procedure to do sensible and hopefully beautiful things that&#39;s all.</p><p>Not many architects have the luxury to reject significant things.</p><p>Cities are the greatest creations of humanity.</p><p>No architect troubled to design houses that suited people who were to live in them, because that would have meant building a whole range of different houses. It was far cheaper and, above all, timesaving to make them identical.</p><p>If I have a style, I am not aware of it.</p><p>Don&#39;t clap too hard - it&#39;s a very old building.</p><p>Form follows function.</p><p>The work of art shows people new directions and thinks of the future. The house thinks of the present.</p><p>My buildings don&#39;t speak in words but by means of their own spaciousness.</p><p>Designed by architects with honorable intentions but hands of palsy.</p><p>The dialogue between client and architect is about as intimate as any conversation you can have, because when you&#39;re talking about building a house, you&#39;re talking about dreams.</p><p>The Romans were not inventors of the supporting arch, but its extended use in vaults and intersecting barrel shapes and domes is theirs.</p><p>The bungalow had more to do with how Americans live today than any other building that has gone remotely by the name of architecture in our history.</p><p>Color in certain places has the great value of making the outlines and structural planes seem more energetic.</p><p>In any architecture, there is an equity between the pragmatic function and the symbolic function.</p><p>At a certain point, I just put the building and the art impulse together. I decided that building was a legitimate way to make sculpture.</p><p>For many years, I have lived uncomfortably with the belief that most planning and architectural design suffers for lack of real and basic purpose. The ultimate purpose, it seems to me, must be the improvement of mankind.</p><p>The frightening thought that what you draw may become a building makes for reasoned lines.</p><p>Buildings should serve people, not the other way around.</p><p>Architects in the past have tended to concentrate their attention on the building as a static object. I believe dynamics are more important: the dynamics of people, their interaction with spaces and environmental condition.</p><p>My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I&#39;m gone.</p><p>In Los Angeles, by the time you&#39;re 35, you&#39;re older than most of the buildings.</p><p>Rome has not seen a modern building in more than half a century. It is a city frozen in time.</p><p>Even at the United Nations, where legend has it that the building was designed so that there could be no corner offices, the expanse of glass in individual offices is said to be a dead giveaway as to rank. Five windows are excellent, one window not so great.</p><p>I have designed the most buildings of any living American architect.</p><p>I am but an architectural composer.</p><p>As a designer, the mission with which we have been charged is simple: providing space at the right cost.</p><p>They can do without architecture who have no olives nor wines in the cellar.</p><p>I call architecture frozen music.</p><p>Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions.</p><p>The greatest advances of civilization, whether in architecture or painting, in science and literature, in industry or agriculture, have never come from centralized government.</p><p>I paint mostly from real life. It has to start with that. Real people, real street scenes, behind the curtain scenes, live models, paintings, photographs, staged setups, architecture, grids, graphic design. Whatever it takes to make it work.</p><p>Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over.</p><p>Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo clock style of architecture.</p><p>The ancient Romans built their greatest masterpieces of architecture, their amphitheaters, for wild beasts to fight in.</p><p>Architecture has recorded the great ideas of the human race. Not only every religious symbol, but every human thought has its page in that vast book.</p><p>There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds.</p><p>All architecture is great architecture after sunset perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks.</p><p>Every man&#39;s work, whether it be literature, or music or pictures or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself.</p><p>I was planning to go into architecture. But when I arrived, architecture was filled up. Acting was right next to it, so I signed up for acting instead.</p><p>Talking about music is like dancing about architecture.</p><p>Architecture begins where engineering ends.</p><p>The mother art is architecture. Without an architecture of our own we have no soul of our own civilization.</p><p>The terrifying and edible beauty of Art Nouveau architecture.</p><p>It is impossible, as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture. That which I have insisted upon as the life of the whole, that spirit which is given only by the hand and eye of the workman, can never be recalled.</p><p>A man of eighty has outlived probably three new schools of painting, two of architecture and poetry and a hundred in dress.</p><p>No architecture is so haughty as that which is simple.</p><p>It seems a fantastic paradox, but it is nevertheless a most important truth, that no architecture can be truly noble which is not imperfect.</p><p>Organic architecture seeks superior sense of use and a finer sense of comfort, expressed in organic simplicity.</p><p>Convinced as I am and as I am from my government that the world needs a new moral architecture over all I believe that this should be the first topic to debate in our world of today, ethics, moral.</p><p>Maybe we can show government how to operate better as a result of better architecture. Eventually, I think Chicago will be the most beautiful great city left in the world.</p><p>Noble life demands a noble architecture for noble uses of noble men. Lack of culture means what it has always meant: ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall.</p><p>Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space.</p><p>All the revision in the world will not save a bad first draft: for the architecture of the thing comes, or fails to come, in the first conception, and revision only affects the detail and ornament, alas!</p><p>All architecture is shelter, all great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space.</p><p>Even though I build buildings and I pursue my architecture, I pursue it as an artist. I deliberately keep a tiny studio. I don&#39;t want to be an architectural firm. I want to remain an artist.</p><p>Engineering, medicine, business, architecture and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent - not with how things are but with how they might be - in short, with design.</p><p>Poetry is not only dream and vision it is the skeleton architecture of our lives. It lays the foundations for a future of change, a bridge across our fears of what has never been before.</p><p>The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.</p><p>All real education is the architecture of the soul.</p><p>Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems. If we split life into separated problems we split the possibilities to make good building art.</p><p>The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line.</p><p>Architecture theory is very interesting.</p><p>Today&#39;s developer is a poor substitute for the committed entrepreneur of the last century for whom the work of architecture represented a chance to celebrate the worth of his enterprise.</p><p>Rationalism is the enemy of art, though necessary as a basis for architecture.</p><p>When you look at Japanese traditional architecture, you have to look at Japanese culture and its relationship with nature. You can actually live in a harmonious, close contact with nature - this very unique to Japan.</p><p>I would have liked maybe to be in architecture or painting, something connected to the fine arts.</p><p>The principle of the Gothic architecture is infinity made imaginable.</p><p>Consider the momentous event in architecture when the wall parted and the column became.</p><p>Architecture and building is about how you get around the obstacles that are presented to you. That sometimes determines how successful you&#39;ll be: How good are you at going around obstacles?</p><p>I could have been an architect, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have been very happy. Nearly all modern architecture is a silly game as far as I can see.</p><p>I see music as fluid architecture.</p><p>Architecture doesn&#39;t come from theory. You don&#39;t think your way through a building.</p><p>Does an architecture to assuage the spirit have a place?</p><p>The new architecture of transparency and lightness comes from Japan and Europe.</p><p>The way of architecture is the quiet voice that underlies it and has guided it from the beginning.</p><p>Vitality is radiated from exceptional art and architecture.</p><p>We are stymied by regulations, limited choice and the threat of litigation. Neither consultants nor industry itself provide research which takes architecture forward.</p><p>To work in architecture you are so much involved with society, with politics, with bureaucrats. It&#39;s a very complicated process to do large projects. You start to see the society, how it functions, how it works. Then you have a lot of criticism about how it works.</p><p>If architecture is frozen music then music must be liquid architecture.</p><p>To create architecture is to put in order. Put what in order? Function and objects.</p><p>I probably spent the first 20 years of my life wanting to be as American as possible. Through my 20s, and into my 30s, I began to become aware of how so much of my art and architecture has a decidedly Eastern character.</p><p>I left science, then I went into art, but I approach things very analytically. I choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them.</p><p>The process I go through in the art and the architecture, I actually want it to be almost childlike. Sometimes I think it&#39;s magical.</p><p>In art or architecture your project is only done when you say it&#39;s done. If you want to rip it apart at the eleventh hour and start all over again, you never finish. I was one of those crazy creatures.</p><p>I loved logic, math, computer programming. I loved systems and logic approaches. And so I just figured architecture is this perfect combination.</p><p>Art is very tricky because it&#39;s what you do for yourself. It&#39;s much harder for me to make those works than the monuments or the architecture.</p><p>In my early 20s I was so miserable doing construction, I wanted something that paid money. I liked nice stuff. I liked cars and architecture, and things that cost money. I wanted to not swing a hammer, and make money... and not do stuff that was dirty. I attempted to get into comedy. I started to do stand-up, but I wasn&#39;t very good at it.</p><p>I&#39;m drawn to furniture design as complete architecture on a minor scale.</p><p>The British political system and the whole clapped out Westminster architecture, and the language that we use about politics, it&#39;s completely unsustainable. You either decide to be part of that transition to do something different. Or you cling to old certainties.</p><p>I got into this little habit of architecture and building. I designed a house in Colorado and one in Hawaii. The idea is supposed to be build and sell - but then I can never bring myself to sell them.</p><p>The only job that was ever of interest to me other than filmmaking is architecture.</p><p>I would like my architecture to inspire people to use their own resources, to move into the future.</p><p>Any architectural project we do takes at least four or five years, so increasingly there is a discrepancy between the acceleration of culture and the continuing slowness of architecture.</p><p>Architecture, of all the arts, is the one which acts the most slowly, but the most surely, on the soul.</p><p>In architecture the idea degenerated. Design allows a more direct and pleasurable route.</p><p>Post-Modernism was a reaction against Modernism. It came quite early to music and literature, and a little later to architecture. And I think it&#39;s still coming to computer science.</p><p>Liquid architecture. It&#39;s like jazz - you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something. And I think it&#39;s a way of - for me, it&#39;s a way of trying to understand the city, and what might happen in the city.</p><p>I see the Beijing National Stadium as an architectural project. I accepted Herzog and De Meuron&#39;s invitation to collaborate on the design, and our proposal won the competition. From beginning to end, I stayed with the project. I am committed to fostering relationships between a city and its architecture.</p><p>The building of the architecture of a novel - the craft of it - is something I never tire of.</p><p>I strive for an architecture from which nothing can be taken away.</p>",2500)]))}const g=a(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
