discussion provided by a literary analysis group following the stories in the collection ban rim thlee it is noted that thammachots employment at the newspaper constrains the opportunities he has to write short stories but at the same time his role working in news media adds to his creative capacity through the perspective of one who is an observer paraphrasing from thaias for the themes that motivate his creative works thammachot remarks that he aims to have people in thai society understand the lives of one another especially the small lives that exist at the fringes of society in thailand he says further that if he is able to accomplish this regardless of how much or little this goal is met people will be able to establish love and understanding and will be able to help and assist one anotherin the collection of short stories ban rim thlee a discussion following the texts by the literary analysis group klm waannkaam phnt provides outlines of the rhetorical character and central themes that emerge in thammachoats work noting that his stories use language to generate a soft rhythm the discussion points out that in almost all of thammachots stories the concept of pleasure and enjoyment khwaamrnrom as a guiding theme in the plot is absent recognizing that there are definite trends of sorrow the group also notes however that the central themes of his work do not concentrate on or suggest a loss of hope rather concepts such as coming to an understanding of the realities of certain conditions gaining new knowledge and uncovering the beauty that hides in lifes small things paraphrasing from thai appear in his work the use of such ideas implies a sense of introducing a moral direction which is aimed to educate the reader in some way in comparison with his short stories his novels are said to bear a lot of similarities in terms of main ideas however the novels contain significantly more description and attention to individual details for example plots concentrating on people who earn a livelihood from the sea tend to show up amid changing economic and environmental circumstances owing to forces beyond their control in both types of work marcel

1960 is a german contemporary artist currently living in paristhe work of veit stratmann has been developed since the early 1990s influenced by artists of the neoavantgarde of the 1970s like michael asher one of the characteristics of many of his works is the focus on the intervention on the location and the deliberate choice of a form of loweraesthetic valuehis work revolves around questioning can an artistic gesture be based on the notions of choice and decisionmaking the postures of those whoencounter the work can this decisionmaking and the infinite suspension of time involved in doing so become constructive materialmorgan marlet describes this in her ma thesis on veit stratmanns work in the urban space as suspending space to suspend timeif political action originates in the act of decision making can an encounter with art generate a permanent oscillation between political and artisticgestures can an artistic gesture undo the coherence of a space without affecting its physical integrity or create a parenthesis or construct a loophole in itsmeaning in order to create the blurring of status can this become creative mattercan an artists work be a deflector can art be the departure point of observation rather than that which is observedstratmanns work is often done in and for public space the presence of an object in public space does not necessarily confer a particular status to that givenobject the encounter with an object in public space does not impose any particular status or behavioural code upon the public both the viewer and thework viewed define the nature and the quality of this encounter public space thus presents an ideal place for posing questions and a way of transforming its fragile status into creative materialveit stratmanns personal history is also at the root of his work in public space and it has undoubtedly conditioned the social issues that underline his line of questioning born in germany he moved to france in 1981 this displacement of his personal territory and focal point from a general sense of belonging in germany to an acute awareness of not belonging in france reoriented his perception of space territory separation and belonging he began to explore the possibilities of influencing his space without actually modifying it becoming aware of the limits of his space brought about questioning how can the limits be made permeable how can the interstices be used how can these territories be adjusted modified transformedthe range of veit stratmanns artistic preoccupations is anchored in this sociocultural and spatial questioning yet his line of questioning enters the sphere of art only when there is exchange with others as many others as possible this naturally pulls his artistic action towards the polis public space not thepolitical space but the space of politics this is where decision and choicemaking negotiation stancetaking limitations and borders take form andmake

sheldon solomon for founding the field of terror management theory tmttmt is a theory that is based on the writings of ernest becker along with other existential thinkers such as sren kierkegaard otto rank and heidegger at the heart of tmt is the notion that human beings have a unique capacity for selfawareness which makes them realize that death is inevitable this realization which conflicts with peoples instinctive need for selfpreservation gives rise to a potential for existential anxiety or terror that is greater than that in other animals to manage this potential for terror people have constructed cultural worldviews which assure people of either a literal form of afterlife eg heaven nirvana or a symbolic form of death transcendence eg being remember after one has died when people live up to the standards implied by their cultural worlviews they attain a sense of positive selfesteem thus tmt suggests that one major psychological function of selfesteem lies in protecting people against existential anxiety tmt was explicitly formulated to be open to empirical testing indeed since tmt was first conceived in the 1980s the theory has inspired hundreds of experiments that were designed to test core ideas of tmt for instance in support of tmt many experiments have shown that reminding people of their own mortality versus a neutral or aversive control topic leads people to defend their cultural worldviews more vigorously for instance people who are briefly reminded of death are more dismissive of someone who criticizes their culture"},{"author":"Tasos

used to prove a link between two people with hiv or aids in a criminal trial in 1994 dr schmidt used a sample of blood taken from one of his aidsinfected patients to inject into his lover and former colleague janice trahan infecting her with hiv six months later ms trahan a nurse was diagnosed with hiv convinced that schmidt had infected her after a suspiciously fleeting latenight visit to give her a vitamin b injection ms trahan had her exhusband and former boyfriends tested all were shown to be negative for hiv results which led lafayette louisiana police to further investigate her claims hiv is a fairly fragile virus and lasts for only a few hours outside the human body detectives examining hospital records found that dr schmidt had taken blood from one patient that night but had never sent the blood to the lab the absence of laboratory testing identification references against this patients name led to police visiting the man who readily disclosed that he had aids and that he had been called in for a blood test by dr schmidt on the evening in question the forensic challenge at that point was to match the dna from the virus itself from the patient to the victim something that had never been done before hiv dna was collected from the victim from the putative patient source and from thirtytwo other unrelated hivpositive individuals living in the same metropolitan area scientists concluded that of all the samples they tested the two viruses dna from the victim and the patient matched almost exactly even with hivs potential to mutate very rapidly it was further disclosed at trial that the victim had also acquired hepatitis c around the same time evidence from schmidts patient records showed that a blood sample was taken from a patient with this virus the day before the hivinfected sample was taken the hep c sample was similarly not matched with any laboratory references these two were the only such omissions found in schmidts patient recordsin 1998 dr schmidt was sentenced to 50 years for second degree attempted murder"},{"author":"Filthy Pedro","quote":"filthy pedro is an antifolk musician based in london born simon parry in anglesey wales he

in health care michael kobernick jillian shank jefferson medical collegeas a result of years of research with the rand corporation and harvard university joseph newhouse has become extremely passionate about the instability of our nations health care system in his 2002 article why is there a quality chasm he describes united states health care as obtaining less value from the resources it uses than other industries prior to proceeding with an explanation of newhouses issues that lead to poor performance it is important to understand the definitions of quality from the institute of medicine iom and in economic terms the iom defines quality as gap between the actual and potential performance of the us healthcare systemin economic terms garber and skinner have explored the principles of productive and allocative inefficiency productive efficiency refers to the impact of inputs like physicians nurses hospital beds and capital on american health care and the authors ask if the impact is greater in other countries more efficient allocative efficiency refers to the benefits from the marginal dollar spent on health care and asks the question do the benefits realized exceed the opportunity cost of other goods not purchased like raising salaries a new car or better education3 the authors found that nearly all countries fall short of ideal in productive efficiency and the united states system lags behind is less efficient other countries most of the time3 they found that the us has a high degree of allocative inefficiency when compared with other highincome countries the causes are high prices for inputs poorly restrained incentives for overutilization and a tendency to adopt expensive medical innovations rapidly even when evidence of effectiveness is weak or absent3combining the quality definition by the iom and economic terms newhouse suggests the reasons for poor this performance stem from the following consumer ignorance technological change administered prices the difficulty in assessing the performance of a given provider and the role of the private sector consumer ignorance is associated with the inability to evaluate if the care provided is correct care and deferral of agency to the physician the consumer is unable to assure high performance in focusing on technology newhouse indicates that each health care system must keep up with new devices medicine and even abide by nationwide use of the emr to make the most informed decisions for each individual this rapid pace of change is often difficult to keep up with resulting in poor quality administered prices are determined between the insurer and provider leading to the input cost adapting to the payment not necessarily the needs of the patient or quality of care newhouse thinks a fixed price for goods and services might assure quality as opposed to the drg in which the hospital makes the most money by providing the minimum service measuring performance is difficult as many outcomes are subjective without accurate measurement the ability to assess the provider is limited finally newhouse cites public sector policy such as creating barriers to entry into health care professions or using public funding for services result in politically based decisions often not in the best interest of overall qualitynewhouses endeavors successfully delineate the reasons for the quality chasm he has a few suggestions greater use of technology to provide better information to the physician during decision making use of computer decision support systems better health services research and better financial incentive design and researchother researchers and health care planners have attempted ways of crossing the quality chasm by improving the organization of health care for individuals organizational improvements include the primary care medical home accountable care organizations and allowing consumers to share in the savings of health payments after selecting coverage that leads to lower costs and higher quality some think increasing government regulation may result in improved access to care reducing social disparities training of more primary care providers and enhancing the verification of provider competence in new technologies as projected by newhouse programs to validate the provision of evidencebased care will enhance the safety of health care as well as medication reconciliation check lists in the operating rooms and care transition management4additional programs to address newhouses problems include payment reform in medicare to restructure programs offering a wider range of services and moving from fee for service to fee for value which then may result in enhanced engagement of the consumer5 increasing the roles and responsibilities of the independent payment advisory board may assist in payment reform as well5 in addition to utilizing an electronic medical record to develop reporting systems that may be used for physician and patient evaluation and care gap closure increased competition amongst health plans through an insurance exchange may lead to better quality and pricing newhouse does an excellent job of describing the problems surrounding the quality chasm and suggesting many interventions to try and cross itreferencesantos j bertko j chernew m cutler d debrantes f goldman d kocher b mcclellan m
