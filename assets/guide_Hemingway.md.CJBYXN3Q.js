We must always try our best to live out our own noble character and experience different lives. If we cannot do everything well, then we should first strive to become a better self, so that our life will be noble enough to shine in the dark night and illuminate our way to surpass ourselves.</p><p>---313---</p><p>When the boy came back, the old man was fast asleep in the chair, and the sun had gone down. The boy picked up an old army blanket from the bed and spread it over the back of the chair, covering the old man&#39;s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, very old, but still strong, and the neck was still strong, and when the old man fell asleep and his head fell forward, the wrinkles were not very obvious. His shirt had been patched so many times that it looked like his sail, and the patches had faded to many different shades in the sun. The old man&#39;s face was very old, and when his eyes were closed, there was no life in his face. The newspaper was spread across his knees, and it was held down by his arm in the evening breeze. He was barefoot.</p><p>---314---</p><p>But all sunshine without shade,all pleasure without pain,is not life at all.</p><p>---315---</p><p>He lay there for a long time with his face buried in his pillow, and after a while he stopped thinking about Prousden and finally fell asleep. He woke up in the middle of the night and heard the sound of the wind whistling in the hemlock forest outside and the sound of the lake lapping against the shore, and then fell asleep again. The next morning, the wind was strong and the lake was flooded to the shore. It took him a long time to wake up before he remembered that his heart was broken.</p><p>---316---</p><p>As long as you don&#39;t care about gains and losses, life is not what can not be overcome.</p><p>---317---</p><p>You know that spring will never die, just as water will flow after it freezes... just as a young person dies for no reason.</p><p>---318---</p><p>&quot;Well, actually, age is my alarm clock,&quot; the old man said. &quot;I really can&#39;t understand why old people wake up so early? Is it to make the days longer and live longer?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know either.

He loved the flying fish very much for they were his main friends on the sea. He felt sorry for the birds, especially the little black terns that were always flying and always looking and seldom finding anything, and he thought that the birds had a harder life than we do, except for the birds of prey and the big strong birds. Why was the sea so cruel and why were birds like these petrels born so weak and delicate? The sea was kind and very beautiful. Yet she could be so cruel sometimes and so suddenly and these flying birds, dropping from the sky to feed, made their tiny, miserable cries, and they were too weak to live on the sea.</p><p>---327---</p><p>How can a woman know that what you say doesn&#39;t mean anything and you are just saying it out of habit and to make yourself more comfortable?</p><p>---328---</p><p>To be honest, he didn&#39;t need these girls per se. They seemed too complicated. What he wanted was something else. He didn&#39;t know what it was, but he vaguely felt that he needed a girlfriend, but he didn&#39;t want to spend too much energy on finding one. It sounded contradictory. Of course, it would be nice to find a girlfriend, and he would be very happy, but he didn&#39;t want to spend a lot of time looking for a girlfriend. He also didn&#39;t want to get involved in the trouble and intrigue. To compete with other men. If he had to pursue her, he wouldn&#39;t do it. He didn&#39;t want to lie anymore. It was not worth it.</p><p>---329---</p><p>It was not quite over yet. It was neither quite finished nor beginning. It was just as real as when it had happened, not erased, but in some ways more prominent. He was mortally ashamed, but worse than the embarrassment was the cold, empty fear that still existed in him, like a cold, slimy hole that took up all the space and squeezed all the confidence out of his body.</p><p>---330---</p><p>He no longer dreamed of storms; no longer dreamed of women; no longer dreamed of great events; no longer dreamed of big fish; no longer dreamed of fights; no longer dreamed of duels; no longer dreamed of his wife. He only dreamed now of places and lions on the beach. They played like kittens in the twilight. He loved them as much as he loved the child. He had never dreamed of the child.</p><p>---331---</p><p>His hope and faith, which had never died out, were now as fresh as the first breath of the breeze.</p><p>---332---</p><p>He didn&#39;t want any consequences. He just wanted to live without any consequences. He didn&#39;t want any consequences anymore. Besides, he didn&#39;t really need a girlfriend. Years of military life had taught him that it wasn&#39;t worth it to pretend that you had to have a girlfriend. Almost everyone did that. But it wasn&#39;t true. You didn&#39;t need a girlfriend.</p><p>---333---</p><p>Once you borrow the money, the next step is to beg for food.</p><p>---334---</p><p>The only source of real ridiculousness is affectation.</p><p>---335---</p><p>He had loved too deeply, demanded too much, and ended up exhausting his passion.</p><p>---336---</p><p>He felt that he could get through any crisis, because no matter what happened, as long as he didn&#39;t take it to heart, it couldn&#39;t hurt him.</p><p>---337---</p><p>How you make a living is where your talent lies.</p><p>---338---</p><p>When a woman says no, it means maybe; when a woman says maybe, it means yes.</p><p>---339---</p><p>No matter whose death I am, I am incomplete because I am inseparable from them.</p><p>Don&#39;t ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for you</p><p>---340---</p><p>Every man&#39;s life ends in the same way, the only difference is how he lives and how he dies.

We lived in a house in the countryside, across the river and the plains, with mountains in the distance. The riverbed was covered with pebbles and large boulders, gleaming white in the sun; the water was clear and flowing fast, with a quiet blue color in the deep water. The troops passed by our house and took the road, raising dust everywhere, even the leaves and tree trunks were covered with dust. Autumn seemed to come early that year, and the leaves fell early. We watched the mighty troops stirring up dust on the road, and the leaves fell in the breeze. After the troops passed, the empty road was filled with fallen leaves.</p><p>---350---</p><p>We can&#39;t ever go back to old things or try and get the &#39;old kick&#39; out of something or find things the way we remembered them.

Miss Barclay was tall, wearing a nurse&#39;s uniform, with blond hair, skin yellowed by the sun, and gray eyes. But I thought she was very attractive. She was holding a cane in her hand, which was very thin and covered with leather, making it look like a horse whip that children play with.</p><p>---353---</p><p>Now is not the time to think about what you don&#39;t have. Think about what you can do with what you have.</p><p>---354---</p><p>This world will hit everyone hard, but after going through it, many people will become stronger in the places where they were hurt.</p><p>---355---</p><p>The first draft is always shit.</p><p>---356---</p><p>You can&#39;t get away from yourself by moving from one place to another.</p><p>You can’t get rid of yourself by moving.</p><p>---357---</p><p>He looked at the vast sea and realized how lonely he was at the moment.

There was a battle going on among the peaks, and even at night, the battle continued. We could clearly see the light of the artillery fire on the mountains. This scene was like lightning in the summer sky, except that the coolness of the night was not as hot as before the thunderstorm.</p><p>---381---</p><p>Age is my alarm clock.</p><p>---382---</p><p>But, just because I&#39;m not crazy, I don&#39;t care.
