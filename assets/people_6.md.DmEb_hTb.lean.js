which he used to develop cellular automaton simulations of billiardball computers in the same work margolus also showed that the billiard ball model could be simulated by a second order cellular automaton a different type of cellular automaton invented by his thesis advisor edward fredkin these two simulations were among the first cellular automata that were both reversible able to be run backwards as well as forwards for any number of time steps without ambiguity and universal able to simulate the operations of any computer program this combination of properties is important in lowenergy computing as it has been shown that the energy dissipation of computing devices may be made arbitrarily small if and only if they are reversible in connection with this issue margolus and

visited by nishida there was no tradition of hunting chimpanzees for bushmeat here it took over an year of effort by kano and his assistant suehisa kuroda before they could habituate the first group of bonobos in the area provisioning them via a sugarcane patch the chimpanzees in the area have little fear of humans because of a local legend that the humans and bonobos were cousins according to this belief an older brother in a family of bonobos held to their traditional lifestyle and his descendants thus remained in the forest as bonobos however his younger brother was tired of eating raw foods once upon a time he was roaming in the forest crying a spirit of the forest taught him to make fire after which he left the forest and began eating cooked food his descendants became humans therefore the village people consider the bonobos akin to distant brothers and do not kill or eat themin the local language bongando one of the words for the bonobo is elia or missed the bonobos are

became a nation 100 years ago he noted that the past controversy has usually been waged in political terms that bore little or no relation to economic facts the wonnacott study is an effort to fill this vacuumthis study contributed to major changes in canadian attitudes toward free trade with the united states in the two decades prior to the negotiation of the free trade pact these changes were reflected in a study by the economic council of canada looking outward 1975 which built upon the work of economists such as the wonnacott brothers john young ted english harry johnson and others who

past the initial frustrations of researching iraq sanctions usually end up on richard garfields doorstep his 1999 report picked apart the faulty methodologies of his predecessors criticized the bogus claims of the antisanctions left admitted when the data were shaky and generally used conservative numbers among his many interesting findings was that every sanctions regime except the one imposed on apartheid south africa led to limitations of food and medicine imports even though such goods were almost always officially exempt from the embargo in many countries he wrote the embargorelated lack of capital was more important than direct restrictions on importing medicine or foodwelch reported his updated conclusionbetween august 1991 and march 1998 there were between 106000 and 227000 excess deaths of children under five recently he has estimated the latter less conservative number at 500000 plus between 1990 and 2002 the chief causes contaminated water lack of highquality foods inadequate breastfeeding poor weaning practices and inadequate supplies in the curative health care system this was the product of both a lack of some essential goods and inadequate or inefficient use of existing essential goodsand of course sanctions even a small number of documentable excess deaths is an expression of a humanitarian disaster and this number is not small he concludedgarfield

worked as a reader and researcher at the university of cambridge until 1966 he was then lecturer in sociology at simon fraser university 1966 to 1969 at aberdeen university from 1969 to 1973 and then as professor of sociology at the university of york from which he retired in 2001 a number of his students have gone on to take distinguished academic posts including nigel gilbert steve woolgar steve yearley andrew webster and jonathan potterbetween the scientific positivism of karl popper and the revolutionary perspective of the kuhnian school mulkay probably stands on a slightly left ground follows robert merton who has been known partially as the predecessor of sociology of scientific knowledge he supports the methodological right of sociology to investigate the process of the production of scientific knowledge by means of comparing illustrating academic influential social circumstance and the informative pattern of individual interaction among scientists who are in debate or cooperation to analyse the effect on scientific research from interprofessional communication mulkay dedicated the significant book the word and the world explorations in the form of sociological analysisin the late 60s and early 70s mulkay used kuhns and mertons work both of which he felt had limitations to formulate an approach that opened the way for internalist perspectives in the comtemporary sociology of sciencehis work in part paralleled and in part preceded the work of the edinburgh school he also sought to create a synthesis between mannheimian sociology of knowledge and mertons sociology of science transforming kuhns idea of scientific revolutions he preferred the concept of rebellion in which rebels within scientific fields branch out to create new fields rather than transforming an existing field by a socalled kuhnian paradigm shift mulkay therefore forms an important link connecting the early sociology of science of the 60s as represented by merton with the rich diversity of contemporary sociology of science which has its origins in the late 60s and early 70s both in mulkays pioneering work and in that of the edinburgh school of barnes bloor and edge as well as in the bath school of collins and pinch which partly succeeded and partly paralleled his own work he therefore remains an important figure who pioneered reflexive studies and epistemological diversity he is perhaps best known for his work on discursive analysis of science and his more recent publications on issues surrounding human embryologyin recent years he has devoted more of his time to basket weaving entering his intricate work at various exhibitions for local artists in east yorkshire"},{"author":"Brigitte Boisselier","quote":"brigitte boisselier born 1956 also known as brigitte
