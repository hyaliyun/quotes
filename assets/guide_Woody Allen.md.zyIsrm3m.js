At a meeting of the General Staff, von Langthe said that it was a mistake to think that you could grow chastity at the same time, and suggested that the wisest way to do it was to concentrate all efforts on growing a good-looking chastity, which the Germans said was to see if you could grow chastity at the same time. Long Meiyi agreed with von Lang&#39;s opinion and said, &quot;It&#39;s not right for me to learn from him, my Lord,&quot; he said, &quot;and it&#39;s not right for you to hurry up and make him grow up.&quot;</p><p>---066---</p><p>It is absurd to film a chaotic movie.

I was an impressionable little boy, born in the so-called &quot;movie age&quot;, where there were no good movies. I discovered Casablanca and Victor Hugo when they came out, and learned about brilliant American films such as Plett Johansson and Capel. I used movies to escape from reality, leaving my shabby home and all the troubles from school and family behind. I went to the cinema, where I could see luxurious rooms, white TVs, charming women and humorous men, and see that they would never have a happy ending, and heroes would never be so great.

I wanted to see a filmmaker who was essentially just a master of technique. The film was great, but I think it was great because it used negative connotations to the extreme, not because of its simple cohesion. Look at The Haunted Man or The Hour, and I found Jane incredibly good and self-absorbed, and I think he was indeed the most self-absorbed filmmaker.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The other key word here is self-indulgence.&quot;</p><p>---103---</p><p>Life is either terrible or miserable, it has to be one or the other.</p><p>---104---</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a good time, you don&#39;t get any wiser.

Some directors like to read reviews, enjoy the feeling of being in the spotlight at the Olympic Games, and enjoy the process with their crew every moment, showing that they are not superficial people. I miss that kind of fun, but I don&#39;t feel that strongly about it. When I finish a work, I thank them and move on to the next one, and I don&#39;t care. I feel happy to be able to keep producing, and not be affected by praise or criticism.</p><p>---113---</p><p>But it&#39;s no secret that the U.S. mafia spent more than $40 billion on child crime each year.

You like your characters, the way they dress, live, talk, and you have a chance to spend a few hours with them. The characters dance to beautiful music, and you are in it. So my films are filled with a fantasy of perfection and frustration. The New York Times once published an article about Susan Sontag&#39;s novel The Lover with Fire, which said that when I handed the book to a small publisher, it was so good that when I went home alone, I read every moment and felt that all the characters in my novel had come to life.</p><p>---115---</p><p>Good people sleep well at night, while bad people enjoy waking up and sleeping soundly.</p><p>---116---</p><p>But having sex without love is the best empty experience.</p><p>---117---</p><p>I try not to predict the public&#39;s attitude and avoid setting a good example for children to learn something simple and casual, something that is entertaining for the masses.</p><p>---118---</p><p>I never take criticism seriously. A book critic criticized my first short story. I was terribly upset. Then I reread the short story and realized that I was right. The novel was terrible.

I happened to come across this treasure when I visited Heidelberg recently to buy some rare scars from a sword fight in the ninth century. Who would have thought that &quot;The Sensible Diet of Nietzsche&quot; existed? A nitpicker might feel that every statement in this book seems slightly doubtful, but most people who have read it carefully will think so. However, they will find that there is a kind of thinker who can learn from Nietzsche, combining the imagery of Birch and Pritikin (Nathan Pritikin (1951-1985), an American nutritionist and pioneer in longevity research) in this book.</p><p>---122---</p><p>As we all know, for many centuries, the &quot;opening of the turkey&quot; was considered obscene.

The Spanish were particularly cruel, and during the Inquisition, anyone who ate avocados or crab meat could be put to death.</p><p>---123---</p><p>I regard others as people who are unjust and rich, and I am suspicious of others.

I don&#39;t know how they survived, but I can&#39;t imagine it. The rest of us can only be &#39;miserable&#39;. So, when you go through this life, you should be glad that you are &#39;miserable&#39;. To be miserable means you are very lucky.&quot; This is the attitude towards life.</p><p>---140---</p><p>I always feel that cynicism is perhaps another form of cynicism, because I feel that I have a very good view on this particular issue of society punishing children. For a thoughtful person, it is obvious that society is a very good place to be because there are a lot of injustices and deliberate crimes, and people use emotional violence and international crimes, which are not only not cured, but sometimes even rewarded. So I don&#39;t think my view is cynical, on the contrary, I think it is particularly accurate.</p><p>---141---</p><p>This is a concept proposed by contemporary French philosopher Pierre-Emile Adot. In short, philosophy is not just a theory or a jargon. For the ancient Greeks, it refers to &quot;love of wisdom&quot; (philosophia), which means to &quot;cultivate one&#39;s self-awareness for the sake of wisdom&quot;. The reason why we emphasize this kind of philosophy as a life is that in modern times, philosophy is just a subject, which is almost only taught in most schools and only represents a theory, which has little to do with our life foundation. This is not the case. For the ancient Greeks, philosophy is not a construction of a conceptual system, but a choice of life. People who choose to study philosophy have two main points: first, they like to study philosophy and debate; second, they apply the results and ideas of debate in their lives.</p><p>---142---</p><p>I started as a student of the Spanish school Huang An.
