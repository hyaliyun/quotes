club greening moved to victoria in 1967 aged 16 and attended northcote high school he made his senior debut for the club the following year in a game against hawthorn and became a regular in the side playing as a ruck rover half forward centreman and wingman he played 94 consecutive games with the club until a major injury on 8 july 1972 during a game against st kilda his next game with collingwood was to be two years later a match against richmondsuch was his impact by 1972 that he finished the 1972 season with a 7th placing in the brownlow medal despite only playing 14 games an average of one vote per game if the last injury game is included in the calculation in the magpies round 14 8 july encounter with st kilda he had suffered severe cerebral concussion as a result of a hit received during the game the incident took place after greening had taken the first mark of the game he kicked the ball towards peter mckenna in the goal square and was floored afterwards by st kilda player jim odea greening who was comatose for 24 hours and didnt regain full consciousness for several days was considered lucky not to die or at least be permanently disabledwhatever happened and i didnt see it i think part of what did happen is he hit the ground and his head hit the cricket pitch i looked down at johnny and it gave me a dreadful fright it was a horrific sight he was severely hurt thompson and fellow magpies were distraught some thought greening would die st kildas jim odea received a 10match suspension for the incident but peter mckenna recalls that the initial fear as greenings teammates ran towards their prostrate young wingman was that they would find him deadgreening rarely spoke of the incident it is not a pleasant anniversary for me i was about 14 days in a coma i went through pretty depressive times and still do it only takes one act of stupidity or violence and that is the end of the ball gameduring 1974 he surprised the footballing community by returning to the vfl gathering 24 possessions in his comeback game he managed just a further two games for the season and a total of six games during 1975 and 1976 before leaving collingwood i made the comeback just to prove that i could do it and that was about all then i sort of stepped back greening then continued his football career for a few years playing with a number of other senior clubs in victoria and tasmania these included port melbourne in the vfa cooee in the nwfu and citysouth in the ntfa fellow magpie len thompson described greening in 2006 now we can say he was of the style

tomac garin may 24 1937 is a croatian politiciana native of slavonski brod zdravko tomac began his political career in communist party of yugoslavia there he rose through the ranks becoming close associate of jakov blaevi in late 1980s he became one of the chief ideologists of league of communists of croatia and one of the closest associates of ivica raanafter croatian communist party rebranded itself into social democratic party of croatia and lost 1990 parliamentary elections tomac worked very hard to steer the party towards the nationalist course close to franjo tuman and ruling croatian democratic union because of that tomac became deputy prime minister in the wartime national unity government of franjo greguri thus becoming one of the first top communist officials in eastern europe to return to top executive post after the fall of berlin wall he served as deputy prime minister from august 1991 to june 1992 there tomac pushed for hardline policies under the pretext of helping war effort including the curbing of press freedom and criticising human rights organisations for their meddling in croatian internal affairsbecause of that many in croatian public saw tomac as just another of many former communist officials who discarded their former ideology in order to embrace croatian nationalism of tuman and hdz the only difference was in tomac choosing to remain within the former communist party this served sdp very well which made tomac into one of their most prominent members and thus gained enough nationalist credentials to improve its electoral chances in the long runtomac showed this potential in the croatian parliamentary election 1995 by winning a sabor seat in zagreb and later serving as a zagreb city assembly speaker and informal opposition leader during the zagreb crisistwo years later he ran as sdp candidate at the croatian presidential election 1997 although tomac failed to unseat tuman he scored an important victory for himself and his party by finishing second with 210 of the vote he came on top of former dissident vladimir gotovac and croatian social liberal party with sdp established as the top opposition party in croatia it had the upper in the negotiations that would lead to 1998 preelection pact with hsls and victory at the croatian parliamentary election 2000ironically 2000 triumph proved to be the beginning of tomacs political decline soon after parliamentary elections croatia had elections for president sdp endorsed draen budia as its candidate and appointed tomac to be his campaign manager what looked like a formality turned into very unpredictable and increasingly vicious contest when stjepan mesi joined the fray when the contest got narrowed to budia and mesi tomac began to pander to nationalist and rightwing voters this didnt have much effect and mesi got easily elected with tomacs position within the party and new government becoming increasingly marginalisedas time went by tomac began to drift from raan and sdp he began to criticise icty and bitterly oppose extradition of croatian generals to hague finally in september 2003 he formally announced his departure from sdphe founded new party called croatian social democrats croatian hrvatski socijaldemokrati but this party even after being allied with few small rightwing parties failed to enter zagreb city assembly on 2005 local electionstomac has been one of the most vocal supporters in croatian politics of the croats of bosnia and herzegovina"},{"author":"Carlos Lyra","quote":"carlos lyra is a brazilian singer and composer

their support for the studys interpretations the british general medical council gmc conducted an inquiry into allegations of misconduct against wakefield and two former colleagues the investigation centred on deers numerous findings including that children with autism were subjected to unnecessary invasive medical procedures such as colonoscopy and lumbar puncture and that wakefield acted without the required ethical approval from an institutional review boardon 28 january 2010 a fivemember statutory tribunal of the gmc found three dozen charges proved including four counts of

of music in copenhagen more recently laurin was appointed professor of the recorder and teaches at stockholms royal college of music and at trinity college in london he researches and lectures on many areas of interpretation music aesthetics recorder acoustics sound techniques and performance issueslaurin can plausibly be said to be one of the greatest players of the recorder active today alongside others such as piers adams and michala petri he has explored and widened the sonic possibilities of the recorder and has an unequalled technical facility his playing explores a wide palette of tonal colours and a striking control of dynamics the expressiveness of his playing is marked by a freedom in moving from the mutest pianissimo to a clear forte within hairbreadth spaces of time his interpretations combine thoughtful musical structure with highly wrought ornamentation and a sometimes wild sense of fantasy his command of improvisation within a strong understanding of harmonic structure brings to 17th and 18thcentury music something of the spirit of jazz masters such as charlie parker but laurins interpretations remain sensitive to the aesthetic and spirit of older music as his many thoughtful essays on his repertoire reveal laurins unique interpretative style is exhibited perhaps at its strongest in his many recordings of vivaldi culminating in a recording of the four seasons released in august 2006 his efforts to broaden the repertoire and to gain for the recorder the status of a concert instrument together with a large orchestra has resulted in several concertos that are already considered classics his 1994 album the swedish recorder earned him a prize from the swedish association of composers this along with three other albums the japanese recorder vivaldi recorder concertos and telemannbach fantasiassolo works resulted in a grammy award commissions include recorder concertos by daniel brtz henrik strindberg fredrick sterling as well as by chiell

reconstructions of instruments from earlier times including an instrument that was designed specifically for laurins 9cd recording of jacob van eycks monumental der fluyten lusthof biscd775780 the largest work ever written for a wind instrument laurin has inspired a new generation of listeners and players and has already trained some of the leading young recorder virtuosi in europe and beyond

his charitable work for the handicapped shanoms stage name was created by another famous radio personality jos vallenilla aka funky joe who hired him as an assistant producer for a popular morning show el meneo woye fm cosmos 94 where because of the nature of the presentation he was forced to create countless parodies and bits that had to compete with the best in the business this was probably what developed his comedy production style later he became the director of the show because luis had been a musician for most of his life he had the added benefit of producing very convincing reproductions of the songs he parodied as a radio producer he holds two outstanding distinctions longestrunning morning show at the number one spot in its market wcmn delta and as the show with the most gimmicks and elements produced to date also on this show he included numerous outstanding features that brought continued attention to the presentation such as a mentalist elsie whose predictions were 100 accurate international stars and internet firsts that placed el meneo at the top of pop culture at the time as a musician shanom has been very influential in the development of what was then considered underground genres such as reggaeton latin rap and tropical techno music influenced by jose vallenilla aka funky joe he produced some of the first ever reggaeton albums but this remained however an underground phenomena his main interest at the time seemed to be the radio parodies for which he was becoming an icon it was through his radio show that the first ever commercially produced latin rap album was aired and released when prime records hired a young artist known as vico c prior to this reggaeton and rap were only street music and part of the comedy bits presented by a character played by shanom in his morning show shanom then went on to make over his personal presentations to include the new developing music it was here that artists like dinamic two vicoc evy queen and falo found the very first outlets to bring their brand of music into the spot light without vico c dinamic two and evy queen the reggaeton genre would probably not existshanom is credited for having launched the career of many radio professionals in the island this probably started as a gimmick when in the early 1990s any one who dared to enter the production studio would somehow end up in a parody or satire that included even family members some remember his very young son playing some characters in the show but mainly young aspiring students who later became active radio professionals some of shanoms most outstanding parodies include a song that was created for the then upcoming movie batman la baticueva an original song that gained international attention and also the salsa versions of michael jacksons songs the batman song was very successful and it led to a record label deal the stations management decided that it was better to include various songs for which they asked wilfred morales who at the time was working as a coproducer in woyecosmos to recreate commercially the next parody which was beginning to take popularity mi abuela this song became the most successful parody ever recorded in pr and was a hit in both the americas and europe shanoms parodies continued to impress the audience and that lead to yet another album this time featuring most of luiss work and out of the control censorship of the radio station shanom updated the production of radionovels a audio comedy version of a spanish soap opera by creating the very first surround simulation over the airwaves this technique won him an award as a production man but he has never revealed how it was done luis had a lot to do with the revolution of internet radio in pr he was the first to air an internet show in the island and had the most popular website for many years using interactive techniques still fresh to this day shanom later paired with one of his students and launched a successful internet radio station dedicated to reggaeton radio actitud this radio station has been rebroadcast live in mexico and per and has helped launch the careers of various reggaeton

glasses and crumbs of food on partially cleared tables often covered with a white linen that bears the mark of spilled wine as alluded in the title morning and melancholia these scenes are often filled with a fresh clear light as though one is viewing from the perspective of the morning after what the host failed to clean up the evening before however the title of the series itself is a reference to an essay by freud mourning and melancholia which discusses the human response to loss the title i did not remember i had forgotten also has a literary source it refers to a line by st
