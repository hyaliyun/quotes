psychologist known for developing a form of attribution theory which explains the emotional and motivational entailments of academic success and failure bernard weiner got interested in the field of attribution after first studying achievement motivation he used tat to identify differences in peoples achievement needs and then turned to the study of individual issues people face when they think of their own successes and failures one of his students linda beckman came up with this topic and from then on bernard weiner carried on further investigation which led him to a road of the cognitive processes that have motivational influence being a threestage process attribution theory explains the causes of an event or behavior the three stages include observations and determination of behavior and attributing to causes there are two types of attributions external and internal external attribution relates causality to outside agents whereas internal attribution assigns the person himself for any behavior in one of his interviews in 1996 bernard weiner was asked the following how does attribution contribute to high ability high achievement and giftedness his answer is the proceeding paragraphthere are two perspectives to consider selfperception and the perceptionof others certain attributions are maladaptive in that they arelikely to reduce achievement strivings among these are attributions of failureto lack of ability which produce low expectancies of future successtied to the stability dimension of causality low selfesteem linked withthe locus dimension and humiliation and shame because these are perceivedas uncontrollable on the other hand failure ascribed to insufficienteffort results in maintenance of expectancy of success and guilt both motivatorscontinuing commerce with the task increases specific ability whichis unstable as opposed to underlying intelligence which is perceived asstable thus by influencing task persistence attributions also influence actualtask abilitythe same is true from the perspective of others if i ascribe your failureto low ability then i as teacher offer sympathy do not punish forfailure and give unsolicited help all these are cues
