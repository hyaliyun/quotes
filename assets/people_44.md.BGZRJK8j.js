statesglovers book causing death and saving lives first published in 1977 addresses practical moral questions about life and death decisions in the areas of abortion infanticide suicide euthanasia choices between people capital punishment and war his approach is broadly consequentialist though he gives significant weight to questions of individual autonomy the kantian notion that we ought to treat other people as ends in themselves rather than merely as means he criticises the idea that mere consciousness or life itself are intrinsically valuable these states matter he argues because they are prerequisites for other things that are valuable and make for a life worth living there is then no absolute sanctity of human life he criticises the principle of double effect and the acts and omissions doctrine the notion that there is a huge moral difference between killing someone and intentionally letting them die in his discussion of real cases of moral decisions about killing he draws on insights from history and literature as well as philosophy throughout the emphasis is on the consequences of moral choices for those affected rather than on abstract principles applied impersonally in humanity a moral history of the twentieth century published in 1999 glover considers the psychological factors that predispose us to commit barbaric acts and suggests how manmade moral traditions and the cultivation of moral imagination can work to restrain us from a ruthlessly selfish treatment of others gaining greater understanding of the monsters within us he argues is part of the process

awareness within the dream and sleep states associated with the dzogchen tradition of buddhism it also describes the relationship between the practices of the night including dream yoga and the passage through the bardos of death and dyingone of the important messages of dream yoga and the practice of natural light is the distinction between the dzogchen awareness referred to as rigpa which arises from the practice of natural light and the more relative but still important experience of luciditythe lucid dream experience which may arise as a byproduct of rigpa awareness or spontaneously due to karmic causes assists in understanding the unreality of phenomena which otherwise during dream or the death experience might be overwhelming in the same way we believe a nightmare to be real but if we were to watch a similar scene within a movie we would not necessarily be frightened many victorians viewed dreams as the garbage of the mind in stark contrast the surrealist movement extending the work of freud beyond its psychoanalytic bounds sought to unite dreams and waking reality numerous traditional societies have similarly placed great stock in dreams viewing them as both a

exposure to the waves and the ocean i nevertheless rushed down to the shore and snatched it out of the water no sooner had i cradled it in my arms than the crystal baby became animated its uniqueness and beauty instantly struck methis dream expresses a great deal about our predicamentand its solution distracted by the 100000 things of the world our crystal awareness or rigpa is temporarily obscured by the waves of violent emotions despite this it is never destroyed and with attention becomes aliveit often takes a kind of shock to stir us from our complacency and habitual tendencies in

the otherwise typical american city of philadelphia the article proved worthy of the 1975 robert f kennedy journalism award for outstanding coverage of the problems of the disadvantagedfor the next seven years schwartznobel traveled the nation doing similar research in several other cities including boston washington and chicago and writing articles for local newspapers and magazines in each city in 1981 she combined her experiences to form her first novel starving in the shadow of plenty in which she outlined the alarmingly destitute living conditions of americas poor families focusing especially on the difficulty of obtaining food and the ineffectuality of government welfare programs her book as well as a number of economic factors contributed to a distinct period of awareness of domestic poverty in the united states the us department of agriculture for example concluded that hunger is increasing at a frenetic pace and the emergency of food available for distribution is quickly depletedafter at least fifteen federal agencies acknowledged the existence of a domestic hunger epidemic schwartznobel considered her duties as a journalist accomplished she resigned herself to other subjects publishing four nonfiction books on unrelated topics the surge in public awareness of the early 1980s never directly caused any significant political action to alleviate hunger or poverty in the united states in fact as early as 1985 the department of agriculture insisted that domestic hunger was no longer a problem and that the united states government was already more successful at preventing malnutrition and poverty than any other administration in history instead of trying to relieve the problem congress reduced funding for nutrition programs by 12 billion the white house also denied the existence of a problem president ronald reagan himself insisted that there was plenty of food available to the poor and that the hungry are too ignorant to know where to get it reagans words caused a public outcry to which he responded by admitting his mistake and personally participating in hands across america shortly thereafter congress responded to hunger concerns for the first time since starving in the shadow of plenty by increasing funding for nutrition programs by 5 billionin 1996 though the passage of contract with america and welfare to work laws threatened the availability of funds for americas hungry families once again schwartznobel responded by reviving her crusade to put an end to hunger in america in 2002 her efforts culminated in growing up empty another muckraking novel sharply critical of federal government welfare policies some especially shocking and controversial elements of the book include her criticism of poverty among families in the us military and the federal governments ironic preoccupation with solving hunger epidemics in other nations rather than focusing on similar problems inside its own borders

livermore national laboratory his most recent interests have mainly been in quantum information theory condensed matter and quantum gravity in 2003 he received the computing anticipatory systems award for a new interpretation of quantum mechanics based on the similarity of quantum mechanics and helmholtz machines he was awarded the e o lawrence award in 1982 by the united states department of energy for leading the team that first demonstrated a working xray laser see photo in the field of condensed matter physics chapline is best known as the originator of the concept of a gossamer metal ie a metal where the density of states at the fermi surface is depressed because of pairing correlations both the actinides and high tc superconductors are examples of gossamer metalschapline is known for his work with nick s manton on finding the classical equations which unify supergravity and yangmills gauge theories these equations play an important role in superstring theory chapline was also the first person to point out that the anomaly cancellation condition for superstrings in 10 dimensions could be satisfied by e8 x e8 and the first person to suggest that the 24dimensional leech lattice might play a central role in a theory unifying gravity and elementary particle physicschapline is perhaps best known for his research on black holes proposing that they do not exist drawing upon quantum mechanical insights of himself and pawel mazur from the early 1900s he proposed that objects currently thought to be black holes are actually darkenergy starsthis idea incorporates the 1980 proposal by robert b laughlin and chapline that the surface of a dark energy star actually represents a quantum critical transition of a superfluid vacuum the chaplinelaughlin theory predicts that spacetimes with a large vacuum energy are unstable to the formation of dark energy stars in the context of the early universe this provides a natural explanation for both dark matter and the metric fluctuations which led to the formation of galaxies a remarkable astrophysical prediction of the chaplinelaughlin theory is that dark energy stars should be prolific sources of positrons because nucleons decay when they encounter the surface of a dark energy star which may explain the strong positron annihilation radiation observed coming from the central region of our galaxychaplines interest in quantum gravity dates from the time when as a teenager he wrote richard feynman a letter about the problem of quantum propagation in a gravitational field because quantum mechanics is intrinsically nonlocal while the equivalence principle is local there is a tension between quantum mechanics and general relativity that has not yet been resolved as a result of his letter feynman invited the 15 year old chapline to have lunch at caltech chapline and feynman talked often about physics in the following years particularly when he was a graduate student at caltech see photo feynman reportedly helped chapline get his first job as an assistant professor at uc santa cruzchapline earned a ba in mathematics at ucla in 1961 he was a member of the 1959 ucla putnam competition

written for the new york amsterdam news the village voice emerge vibe life and the crisishe is the author of innocents lost when child soldiers go to war which is about children that have been forced to fight wars briggs has disputed the popular saying that the truth is the first casualty of war he believes the first casualty of war is always the children young children are being used as soldiers scouts cooks and sexual servants in conflicts around the world these conflicts are mostly third world countries where there is little or no enforcement of laws and the children are often fighting on both sides of the conflicts the organization with the dubious distinction of having the youngest soldier only five years old forced to fight with small arms is the lords resistance army in uganda led by joseph kony even the most intense media coverage of a war pays very little attention to the children who are affected this includes those forced into combat as well as those that are wounded or killed as a result of collateral damage and those who suffer from malnutrition and lack of schooling and medical treatmentmilitary commanders throughout the world are attracted to young soldiers for combat because they can easily be trained to carry out the most repulsive orders they can be found in abundance when adult soldiers are scarce and they can be forced to fight for little or no pay they often give them drugs to keep them dependent on their leaders and make them more susceptible to indoctrination by their leadersmost researchers into child soldiers including briggs and p w singer believe that the ones who should be held accountable for the crimes of children in war are the adults who force them into combat not the children however the children do need to be reeducated properly until they can function normally in society in many cases the people from the hometowns hold them accountable and dont want them to come back since they dont feel they can trust them in some cases these children are held in the same prisons as adults and are subject to additional physical abuse and rape in some cases when they are fighting for the resistance these child soldiers are labeled terrorists this is less likely to happen if the child soldiers are fighting for the government in power sometimes they have been held for years without access to lawyers or trial including some child soldiers who were arrested for genocide in rwanda under rwanda law children under fourteen cant be tried however this wasnt strictly enforced partly because they didnt know how old the children were in some cases people lied about their age to get out in others children under fourteen were held anyway unlike south africa rwanda didnt have a truth and reconciliation commission to reveal the truth without prosecuting war criminals p w singer has concluded that this helped reduce the uses of child soldiers in south africa however it also left a lot of unemployed soldiers who were only trained for combat some of these soldiers became mercenaries for hire and were later accused of additional war crimesmany of the conflicts involving children are motivated by class differences business and drug interests in many cases these wars are fought over resources like opium coca diamonds oil and coltan religion is also a factor that motivates some of these conflict including the lords resistance army in uganda and the taliban in afghanistan these religious institutions often push religious education in favor secular schools several humanitarians including jimmie briggs have expressed hope

amendments from brunel university on a linguistic analysis of francis bacons contribution to three shakespeare plays the comedy of errors loves labours lost and the tempest see download clarke holds the view that since there are no extant letters or prose works by shakespeare no test is possible that can exclude the man from stratford from having contributed to the work under his name however there is evidence that it would have been difficult for him to have originated plays like the comedy of errors and loves labours lost which have connections to the exclusive inns of court also the writing of the tempest depended on inside information about the virginia company of which shakespeare was not a member see download clarke argues that these plays were likely acquired later by his company for revision and expansion for the public theater use of the early english books online database has also led clarke to the discovery that there are significant rare phrase matches between the work of francis bacon and these three plays bacon was a main contributor to the 15945 grays inn revels when the first known performance of the comedy of errors occurred and he was a leading member of
