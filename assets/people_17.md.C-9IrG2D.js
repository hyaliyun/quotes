not altogether inappropriate susanna and eileen have been shaped with a silky emphasis on idealizationcontours slope elegantly symmetry quietly emphasized with facial features stoic and streamlined though mr grausmans industrial material retains a certain artificial patina it ultimately recalls the quarry rather than the factory a tendency toward abstractionuniversality reallyunderlines the artists belief that art can traverse and find meaning within cultures the world overmr grausmans work is remarkably amenable to public spaceshis sculptures are a highlight of the pratt institutes oncampus sculpture park but just because the sculptures look great surrounded by trees and under the clouds doesnt mean they wouldnt look great indoors moma could do worseand in fact hasthan feature

contemporary art scene today for one thing his portraits are real portraits they address themselves to character and personality and attempt an account of them they are not simply a value accumulation of threedimensional gestures in search of some associations with a recognizable subject for another they are real sculpture their form is compelling their surfaces have an astonishing clarity and finish and they have a haunting physical presence in a period when portrait sculpture of significant quality is a rarity mr grausman works as if it were a flourishing genre and in his portraits it is

Kuczewski","quote":"mark kuczewski is an american philosopher and bioethicist who has been a key contributor to the new professionalism movement in medicine and medical education in general interest in professionalism has been widespread in medicine probably owing to the increasing regulatory and economic pressures on the practice of medicine many physicians have sought to identify the focal meaning of what it is to be a doctor in an effort to revitalize the profession kuczewski has been among a group that includes richard and sylvia creuss john coulehan and matt wynia who see medical professionalism as including a commitment to social justice that is while professionalism entails such things as etiquette communication skills and basic medical ethics professions are also expected to be leaders in educating the public and in advocating for the health of the public such leadership requires an understanding of the factors that lead some patient populations to be underserved and a commitment to bringing about social change to ameliorate these problemsthe new professionalism movement in medicine is a revival of communitarian bioethics that focus on the kinds of people and society we wish to be rather than on particular ethical questions of right and wrong this focus on the relationship between the professional and the community can have important implications for medical education and professional development while not eschewing case analysis and problem solving the emphasis on the development of the person has created a renewed interest in narrative methods and reflection kuczewski has been an outspoken critic of efforts in medical education to focus on quantitative measures of professionalism education he has argued that in an effort to make professionalism education objective many medical educators are equating professionalism with trivial but easily measured behaviorskuczewskis interest in professionalism and social justice has led him to pursue ethical issues in the interactions between medicine and recent immigrant populations he has brought his work in communitarian and casuistic methods to bear on questions such as medical repatriation insurance for undocumented immigrants and the eligibility of dreamers undocumented immigrants who were brought to the united states as children to become practicing physicians his

of several of her victims strongly denied that their relatives had expressed any will to die much less asked malvre to kill themchargeswhile in questioning christine malvre originally admitted to assisting in the death of 30 terminally ill patients at franois quesnay hospital in manteslajolie on the outskirts of paris a statement which she later on recanted stating that she made the original confession under duress although being originally charged with the lesser charge of manslaughter malvres charge was upgraded to that of murder following a report that stated that the nurse had a morbid fascination with death and disease and that patients were three to four times more likely to die while during mmemalvres duty periods in the advanced cancer ward according to olivier morice a lawyer for five patients families who had died in malvres care the charge of murder came about because the judge had realized we are dealing with a serial killer more than with a madonna of euthanasia prosecutors argued for this charge to be seen as a murder charge rather than manslaughter because they believed christine should be treated the same way as any other serial killer rather than a madonna of euthanasia shortly after her release on bail malevre tried to commit suicide herself by overdosing on drugs but was unsuccessfultrialmalvre went on trial in versailles on 20 january 2003 on

injecting them with lethal doses of morphine potassium or other various drugs but denied being responsible for the other three deaths she went on to state that her reason for lethally injecting these patients was due to the fact that the patients requested to die and she helped them do so out of compassion in a book she later penned called my confession malvre stated i helped people to end their suffering and depart in peace i did not kill i am not a criminal prosecutors on the other hand did not agree with this statement nicknamed the black widow by her colleagues prosecutors told the court that mme malvres motives for ending the lives of these gravely ill patients were not out of the kindness of her own heart but rather due to her morbid fascination with death and illness and by killing these patients she was satisfying her sick compulsions families of the deceased also went on the record to agree with the prosecution that mme malvre killed for her own good not for the good of her

to ten years of prison for the murder of six of the seven patients she had assisted in killing on top of this sentence christine malvre was also permanently banned from working as a nursecontroversythe arrest of mme malvre raised national debate over both the case as well as the controversial topic of euthanasia in france where unlike netherland and belgium do not allow for euthanasia france itself is divided between strong roman catholic hostility towards euthanasia as well as mounting pressure from the liberals to decriminalize assisted suicide this division of pro and con euthanasia is just as visible in the divide between those who supported christine malvres actions and those who did not after originally admitting to helping 30 gravellyill patients kill themselves malvre received an outpouring of support from both the public and ministers malvre received over 5000 letter from the public showing support and appreciation for her acts of compassion and health minister bernard kouchner stated that everyone should avoid hasty moral judgement when it came to malvres case the media was also generally sympathetic toward malvre someone they described as a model nurse who was helping these terminally ill patients end their life of misery for the good of the patient despite this outpour of success public opinion seemed to turn against christine malvre when details of the case were leaked by judges and family members that stated the terminallyill patients that malvre had helped in ending their own lives neither wanted nor asked malvre to aid in their suicide the main association that supports the righttodie immediately dropped its support for malvre and public opinion turned quickly against her to now support the prosecutor and lawyers

training method is based on the theory that dogs being descended from wolves fit the social model of the pack an ordered hierarchy with a clearly defined leader she believes that dogs are unable to understand any other social model and when coopted into human families as pets still see themselves as pack members fennell argues that most inappropriate dog behavior arises if the owner does not consistently signal that he or she is pack leader theoretically this makes the dog anxious it cannot conceive of a leaderless pack and so if its owner abdicates leadership the dog has no option but to try to take on the alpha role itself in the attempt it may become aggressive or difficult to handle as it tries to assert dominance hyperactive through uncertainty on what it should be doing or sometimes acutely stressedother dog experts have cited recent scientific research to challenge the theory that dog behavior is based on the model of the wolf pack criticizing this as an oversimplificationdue to this many of fennells beliefs are considered dated and archaic no longer being scientifically accuratefennells method called amichien bonding from the french ami meaning

subordinate it can then possibly trust its owner to take decisions and will become contented and relaxed fennell does not believe in physically dominating or chastising the dogamichien bonding essentially means the dog is consistently shown by the owner that the human half of the partnership is responsible for making decisions the dog is not physically dominated but is trained through among other behaviors ignoring the animal at certain times this is done to reassure it that it is not the one responsible for leadership and decisionmaking there is dispute over whether this type of

papers chapters and books on a number of subjects in the field of psychologymcguinness is an outspoken critic of whole language instruction but also of phonics as traditionally taught in the united states she favors an approach to early reading instruction known as synthetic phonics or linguistic phonics in which the starting point for instruction is the 40odd phonemes of english in synthetic phonics instruction each sound is introduced initially with a single basic code spelling eg the ee sound is connected to the ee spelling students are taught to read by blending all of the sounds in the word spelling alternatives for sounds eg for ee the spellings y as in funny ea as in eat e as in reflex ie as in cookie etc are taught later mcguinness has also introduced the term code overlap to describe a spelling or grapheme that can stand for more than one sound phoneme eg the spelling ow can stand for the ou sound as in the word now or for the oe sound as in the word snow mcguinness has stirred up controversy for her views on dyslexia and teaching letter names she argues that dyslexia is not a biological condition but a socially created problem that results from a complex spelling code and ineffective teaching methods she has argued against teaching the letter names in the early phases of instruction on the grounds that letter names can confuse students what is important
