at princeton university the institute for advanced studies and the institute for theoretical physics at the university of koeln germanybrans is well known among those engaged in the study of gravity and is noted for his development with robert h dicke of the bransdicke1 theory of gravitation in which the gravitational constant varies with time a leading competitor of einsteins theory of general relativity the work of brans and dicke actually was closely related to earlier work of pascual jordan but was developed independently this formulation is often referred to as the jordanbransdicke jbd scalartensor theory of gravity in this theory based on speculations of mach eddington dirac and others a universally coupled scalar field in addition to the metric is introduced which ultimately results in a theory in which the gravitational constant depends on the distribution of matter in the universe a number of very accurate measurements made in the late 1970s has indicated that jbd fares

Ewald","quote":"paul w ewald is an evolutionary biologist specializing in the evolution of infectious disease he received his bsc in 1975 from the university of california irvine in biological sciences and his phd in 1980 from the university of washington in zoology with specialization in ecology and evolution he is currently director of the program in evolutionary medicine at the biology department of the university of louisvilleewald asserts along with a growing body of peer reviewed studies published in mainstream scientific journals that many common diseases of unknown origin are in fact the result of chronic lowlevel infections from viruses bacteria or protozoa for example cervical cancer can be caused by the human papilloma virus some cases of liver cancer are caused by hepatitis c or b and the bacteria helicobacter pylori has been proven to cause stomach ulcers ewald argues that many common diseases of currently unknown etiology such as cancers heart attacks stroke and alzheimers may likewise be also caused by chronic lowlevel microbial infectionewald disagrees with the popular theory that genes alone dictate chronic disease susceptibility ewald whose background is in evolutionary biology points out that any disease causing gene that reduces survival and reproduction would normally eliminate itself over a number of generations ewald says that chronic diseases if they are common and damaging must be powerful eliminators of any genetic instruction that may cause them one example of this is schizophrenia patients with this mental illness rarely reproduce ewald argues that just by evolutionary pressures schizophrenia would have already been eliminated if its causes were strictly genetic he suggests that in future an infectious cause of schizophrenia will be discoveredewald explains that purely genetic causes of chronic disease will persist only if a genetic instruction provides a compensating benefit for example the disease sickle cell anemia is caused by a genetic mutation that in heterozygotes protects against malaria which kills millions worldwide each yearfurther evidence for a nongenetic etiology of diseases like schizophrenia ewald also points comes from concordance studies on identical twins which measure the percentage of identical twins who both develop a disease a concordance of 100 indicates a primarily genetic disease which is not really influenced by environmental factors like infection nutrition or toxins huntingtons disease for example has a concordance rate of 100 indicating a predominately genetic etiology however when the concordance rate is lower this indicates environmental factors like infectious microbes or toxin exposure are playing a causal role schizophrenias concordance is approximately 3560 suggesting says ewald that microbes are etiologically involved another example is breast cancer ewald notes that in the case of identical twins when one twin develops breast cancer the other twin has only a 10 to 20 chance of developing the disease and this concordance rate of just 20 again indicates that environmental factors like infectious microbes or toxins are likely playing large causal roles in breast cancerewalds curiosity regarding the evolutionary process of infections was sparked by his fateful bout of diarrhea in the late 1970s his first thought during this bout was that his body was using diarrhea to expel the pathogen and he should avoid antidiarrheal medication looking at the problem from the standpoint of the organism expulsion was not an evolutionary benefit the only benefit to the pathogen causing the sickness would be the potential transmission to other hosts much like the particulate expelled during coughing diarrhea can be a means of distribution another major influence on ewalds thinking in evolutionary biology terms was the hiv virus which once caught initially remains inactive for years thus allowing it to spread before the chronic disease of aids finally manifests incapacitates and eventually kills the host"},{"author":"Lorraine Miller","quote":"lorraine c miller of fort worth texas was the 35th clerk of the united states house of representatives miller

hillary rodhamclintons race for presidential nomination in the face of sexism mostly propagated by the american media and what this meant for other women throughout their own careers and participation in politics although lawless recognizes that rodhamclinton was an exception to the rule in terms of the backlash she faced during her campaign due to her previous 17 years in politics and her husbands widely discussed extramarital affairs she argued that rodhamclintons experience during the race shed light on at least three gender dynamics that affect women in politics therefore suggesting that the political terrain is more complex for women than for men while the three gender dynamics which emerged from the 2008 election for democratic presidential nominee do not represent the full spectrum of obstacles which burden women in the public sphere of politics as they are mostly based on only one womans experiences they still represent the dimensions of gender and power that men in politics are not required to perform against overall these dynamics include the fact that rodhamclinton was forced to manage her campaign within the confines of a sexist environment recognition of this environment subsequently made other women in politics question the extent to which they were qualified for public office or were willing to face such biased scrutiny and finally the fact that by endorsing barack obama over rodhamclinton women were expected to justify their response at the risk of being considered a traitor to their genderfurthermore while lawless states in many cases women feel better about government when more women are included in positions of political power and are accomplished in terms of fundraising and winning elections despite these successes womens own perceptions of bias against their gender describes another hurdle which aggravates their reluctance to run for office this reluctance and questioning of oneself in turn represents the deeply embedded sexist attitudes which are prevalent throughout politics and provides one explanation for the gender gap which is still experienced and thereby reinforced from these dynamics especially when compared to the long established malecentric atmosphere of high politics it becomes increasingly obvious that there continues to be sexist and biased standards which women are expected to both measure themselves against

wa afrikas newspaper the sunday times subsequently quoted a senior police official close to the case as admitting ja its political pressure while wa afrika himself claimed to have been asked by his

who are the big politicians im working with behind the scenes this made me conclude the police were sent by politicians to harass and intimidate methe prosecution claims that wa afrika was in possession of a forged letter of resignation from mpumalanga premier david mabuza whose denial and formal complaint at the kabokweni police station in nelspruit it was that culminated in the arrest the letter faxed anonymously to the sunday times had yet to be publicised the arrest took place on wednesday 4 august at 1115 outside the sunday times building in rosebank johannesburg in spite of the fact that wa afrikas lawyer who has since echoed claims of political meddling had already negotiated for him to hand himself over at the kabokweni police stationseveral police vehicles with sirens

conceptions of christianity and argued that the nazi party was not antichristian as popularly understood nor was it in any sense a paganist movementexploring the concept of positive christianity steigmanngall writes that many in the nazi party leadership believed themselves and their movement to be inherently christian he argues that while use of the term positive christianity in the nazi party program of 1920 is commonly regarded by historians as a tactical measure he instead believes that it was more than a political ploy and adhered to an inner logic though he agrees that antichristians later fought to expunge christian influence from nazism and the movement became increasingly hostile to the churchesthe holy reich has been translated into spanish portuguese and italian it has been reviewed widely culminating in a symposium on the book published by the journal of contemporary history in 2007 in a 2003 review of the book historian john s conway wrote that steigmanngall made an almost convincing case and was right to point out that there never was a consensus among the leading nazis about the relationship between the party and christianity but that the differences between this interpretation and those put forward earlier are really only ones of degree and timing steigmanngall agrees that from 1937 onwards nazi policy toward the churches became much more hostile he argues persuasively that the nazi partys 1924 program and hitlers policymaking speeches of the early years were not just politically motivated or deceptive in intent steigmanngall considers these speeches to be a sincere appreciation of christianity yet he is not ready to admit that this nazi christianity was eviscerated of all the most essential orthodox dogmas what remained was the vaguest impression combined with antijewish prejudice only a few radicals on the extreme wing of liberal protestantism would recognize such a mishmash as true christianityon september 30 2009
