My dream was beyond imagination, beyond everything. I threw myself into it with a creative passion, constantly adding to it with talent, adorning it with a feather of color that floated from the sky.

Annie used to hang a photo of her young lover opposite the bathtub, which would create a sense of relaxation and a world where she could lie in the bathtub and follow the mist, and where she could gaze at her lover&#39;s figure and imagine the warmth and lifelike beauty.</p><p>---087---</p><p>The four places have different basic moral values ​​for each of you and cannot be treated equally.</p><p>---088---</p><p>In the long dark night of the soul, it is always the early morning.</p><p>---089---</p><p>I think I started to say that it should be the one that likes it.</p><p>---090---</p><p>You can wear that hat if you want to dance.

The tears on Dai Cheng&#39;s face are so white that I jumped up and wiped my face with a handkerchief in front of the mirror. I know you are Gates. When he left, a confusing change happened. It was a simple light shining. Although there were words and gestures expressing joy, a new happiness emanated from him and filled his little room.</p><p>---092---</p><p>I kept looking at things, and I thought to myself that I was going to revalue the house in ten months according to the eyes of my beloved child. Sometimes I was dazed and looked at my finances, as if I was looking down at this thrilling person. All these things were not worth it. Once I almost fell down the stairs.</p><p>---093---</p><p>It was an age of miracles, it was an age of art, it was an age of excess, and it was an age of satire.</p><p>This is an age of miracles, an age of art, an age of free will, and an age of ridicule.</p><p>---094---</p><p>Of course all life is a process of breaking down.</p><p>After four days, you will have more doubts, all life is like a process of collapse.</p><p>---095---</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about the emotions or people around you,&quot; Xiaokan wanted to say, &quot;Except myself, and my extension, I began to talk to you and An Ni. All life is like the wind following this law. Xiaokan, it can&#39;t be counted. I am the only one who developed it. There is no one else I can use to understand the world, unless you don&#39;t understand enough, so I don&#39;t want to understand anything because you don&#39;t understand.&quot;</p><p>---096---</p><p>There is only one kind of understanding person who is really good - and not just understanding. It is the kind of expression that you rarely see, that you think you have to be comfortable with, and that you may only encounter once in your life. It is specially prepared for you, as if among all the people in the world, only you can feel that you can&#39;t help but like this person. This expression means that someone completely understands you, absolutely believes in you, and the impression this person has on you is exactly what you want others to leave.</p><p>---097---</p><p>&quot;No, that&#39;s not good,&quot; he said to the pile of fur that couldn&#39;t see his face. &quot;You have to be careful when dealing with people. But respecting people is another matter. You can&#39;t just call someone a coward or a liar. But if you are so cautious all your life, afraid of hurting people&#39;s feelings and belittling them by saying nice things, you won&#39;t know which of us are worthy of respect.&quot;</p><p>---098---</p><p>In such a small time, only in that single, fleeting moment of yours, can I and him become one, the ideal future and the lingering past be intertwined with each other - in that brilliant moment of yours, birth and sleep have indeed become a dream.</p><p>---099---</p><p>If my assumptions were wrong, then I must have understood the truth. I had paid a high price for having a dream for too long in that warm dream. I must have looked up through those terrible leaves and found that the sky was so strange. I must have felt a chill when I found that the roses were so ugly and the sunlight shining on the sparse grass was so cruel. I was like being in a new dream, a concrete and false dream, in which the poor ghost breathed the empty child&#39;s dream, floating through the dream...</p><p>---100---</p><p>There is an element of loneliness involved - it&#39;s so easy to love someone when you&#39;re young - but it&#39;s so hard to love someone when there&#39;s no one around.</p><p>---101---</p><p>Drinking can make the happy months and years pass by in the past, as if they can still be in another world, or even connected to the future, as if they can happen again in my mind.</p><p>---102---</p><p>We are in the boat behind the ten children, and we can get as much as we can from the outside. But this is the truth that he pushed us back to the past.</p><p>---103---</p><p>I spent six nights in New York City on Sunday, and I remember the bright lights and the glittering lights of the nightclubs I visited when I was there. I can still hear the faint sounds of joy and cheer drifting from the garden, and I can hear cars driving up and down the driveway. One night I did hear a car, saw its lights shining on the doorstep, and I went to see it. Probably my last guest, he had just returned from the end of the world, not knowing that the nightclub had been packed up.</p><p>---104---</p><p>I&#39;ll tell you how rich people are. They are different from you and me. They have been rich since childhood and used to enjoy themselves. This is because they are strong and not weak. They believe in their own wealth and do not play with their own image. This is not the case for people who are born rich. You can&#39;t understand it. Deep down, they think that they are the ones who understand them, and they are looking for compensation and protection for their own ignorance. So they don&#39;t think about it until they go deep into their own image, or they lower themselves to below themselves. They think that they are the ones who understand them. They are different from you and me.</p><p>---105---</p><p>I sit here thinking now, and I have been sitting here thinking for a while, for an hour or more, watching other people like you, Dick and Gracias pass by with so many happy souls bigger than me, and I am moved by your dancing, singing, loving and hating, never ending, and I am moved by your lack of emotion for myself, and I have been sitting here quietly for a while, and in this way I have been here.</p><p>---106---</p><p>One year I wrote a series of serious editorials for the Yale News that I thought would be useful to my children—and now I am bringing them back to my life, to those who have learned from their studies and are not experts. This is not just a famous saying, but it means that you will be more successful in life if you can see the world through a window.</p><p>---107---</p><p>He is not a child.

As a child, there were both surprises and heavy burdens. Young scholars underestimated &quot;fate&quot; and developed a kind of almost mysterious definition of &quot;will&quot; - the worst outcome was Napoleon&#39;s disillusionment.</p><p>---115---</p><p>Now I know that what I&#39;ve told you is just a story of how Tom, Gates, Debbie, Jordan and I were all that kind of people, and perhaps we all had some flaw in common that made us unable to adapt to the life we ​​were telling you about.</p><p>---116---</p><p>What I don&#39;t know is that my dream has already landed in this country, on the vast expanse of New York that stretches across four continents, and on the endless American wilderness under the dark night.</p><p>---117---</p><p>You look down on others and criticize them. No one likes you. It&#39;s not like you have such a good reputation.</p><p>---118---</p><p>We have struggled so hard, but the little boy looked up at us, and the waves kept pushing him back to the past.</p><p>---119---</p><p>which bitch do you think you are？</p><p>---120---</p><p>&quot;I want to hug you tighter and kiss you again, but I can&#39;t help feeling cold. I know you&#39;re evil to me when we kissed. That glance when our lips touched was not a glance at me, but a glance at me. I want to leave this world in the darkness of the night, just like the darkness below. I don&#39;t know that the light that can be emitted belongs to my heart; only when I understand this point, and combine my passion with that of the universe, can he possess me without hesitation or regret.&quot;</p><p>---121---</p><p>Just as Dai Cheng&#39;s house seemed even more mysterious and joyful when he went there a few months later, it was easy for me to leave this city as a child. Although it seemed so small in my mind that I would never return, it still exuded a kind of melancholy beauty that was unique to that place.</p><p>---122---</p><p>The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.</p><p>At the same time, maintaining the idea of ​​​​being in all four opposite states, and then developing the ability to correct it outside, is a sign of first-class wisdom.</p><p>---123---</p><p>Since you and Jordan left, why don&#39;t we grow up together? I underestimate the growth of young people. I keep hiding the long-forgotten dreams in my heart year after year.</p><p>---124---</p><p>New Yorkers are like proud kids who climb up here, only to be dismayed to see, the scenery before them is completely unexpected and unexpected, this city is not what you imagined, the streets stretch out endlessly, it has always been there… From this newly built building, it is the first time to see the city itself disappear in the countryside below, blending into a sea of ​​blue, green and white. The only thing we don’t want is that you can never reach it. This terrifying epiphany made the scholar realize that New York is, after all, just a city, not the entire universe, so he wanted to use the brilliant system of concepts he had carefully built over the years to blast it all over the world.</p><p>---125---</p><p>The test standard of first-class intelligence is to hold on to the same concept and to be able to develop the ability to get the outside world out of it.</p><p>---126---</p><p>When I went back to that place, I noticed that the panic expression on Gates&#39; face was as if he was doubting that his happiness was real. It&#39;s been almost five years! I saw that Daisy must have learned a lot from her. It&#39;s not that Daisy herself has any shortcomings, but it&#39;s because I imagined Daisy too beautifully. This fantasy surpassed Daisy and everything else. All my efforts in the past few years have been used to create this fantasy, and I have been constantly adding to it. Of course, all the good things I encountered have been used to embellish it. Such fiery passion and such beautiful children have been expressed, and they are also the fantasies accumulated in my heart trapped in love.</p><p>---127---</p><p>Take that thing as a hat, if you can move me,</p><p>If you can dance for Xiaokan, then dance for Xiaokan too.</p><p>I want to be moved by someone who is not to say: &#39;My love, my love, my love,</p><p>I must have you!&#39;</p><p>---128---</p><p>If you think you have a virtue that others underestimate, then my virtue is this: honesty and talent.

All the intelligence is mixed into the disguise of the child, and the child&#39;s talent is also a mask under the object of the imagination. The imagination does not need to be used; the true nature of the imagination is like the imagination of a child, romantic, and illogical.&quot;</p><p>---139---</p><p>I think I&#39;m smart enough. I used to carry a little dream on my back, but as time went by, I had already forgotten what other dreams I had.</p><p>---140---</p><p>Don&#39;t judge anyone, so don&#39;t have unlimited hope for them.</p><p>---141---</p><p>If everyone is so attracted to a child, doesn&#39;t it mean that their original feelings lack inner strength?</p><p>---142---</p><p>The world only exists in your eyes-- your conception of it.</p><p>The only thing that exists below the surface is the talent of your child—it depends on how you look at it.</p><p>---143---</p><p>Fourth, you are a sensitive adult, so you are born with the right to be unhappy. ​​​​</p><p>---144---</p><p>So we paddled as hard as we could, rowing our boat upstream, never going backwards until we had reached a certain point, until we were forever swimming past.</p><p>---145---</p><p>So we try our best to move forward, go against the current, and keep struggling, but the reality is that we are just returning to the past when we were young.</p><p>---146---</p><p>Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven&#39;t had the advantages that you&#39;ve had.</p><p>---147---</p><p>I have escaped from this world and have found a way out of it. I am both intoxicated and disgusted by the ever-changing world of life.</p><p>---148---</p><p>There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.</p><p>Only when there is a limit to what is left is there. Only when this month comes, he has pursuers and pursuers, busy and tired people.</p><p>---149---</p><p>There is no real dark night of the soul, it seems like the wind is blowing at ten o&#39;clock in the morning.</p><p>---150---</p><p>This means that not everyone out there has the advantages that you have.</p><p>---151---</p><p>Fourth, if you are a person like Shifeng, you doubt that you have run away. This is a rare virtue. I think so: as far as I know, there are not many people who are as honest as the others, and I am one of them.</p><p>---152---</p><p>&quot;When you want to look down on someone,&quot; someone told me, &quot;you just have to look down on them. In this context, not everyone has the same advantages as you.&quot;</p><p>---153---</p><p>Long time ago</p><p>I know that something has started to happen in my heart. Can I say it?</p><p>Now that you are on the road, I have begun to tell you the truth.</p><p>The truth is gone, you&#39;re gone</p><p>Gone</p><p>I can&#39;t cry</p><p>You&#39;re more concerned than I am</p><p>So I started to say that I would never come back.</p><p>---154---</p><p>I don&#39;t want to know your privacy - if I follow my experience over the past few years, I find that someone is confiding in me, I usually pretend to be asleep, busy or absent-minded. I have been expressing my love for you for many years, and there are many words to express them, which can tell you that you are not sincere, and you still want to say it. Don&#39;t judge anyone, so you have unlimited hope for everyone.</p><p>---155---</p><p>&quot;They&#39;re all bastards,&quot; I said across the lawn to the kid, &quot;all those bastards combined are worth more than you can afford.&quot;</p><p>I was a year older than you when he said that to me. It was the only compliment I ever paid you, and I had always been very unhappy with you. She nodded politely at first, then her face lit up with that bright, contemptuous look she gave me, as if this was something we had known for years. Her gorgeous pink suit, set against the white steps, reminded me of the night I first visited this old house. The lawn and driveway were packed with people, and it was hard to imagine how filthy people were - people who looked down on others and could stand on those steps and places, hiding their pure dreams, waving goodbye to us.</p><p>---156---</p><p>Looking through the window, the sky seems particularly soft in the sunset, like a blue sea opening up.</p><p>---157---</p><p>A difficult thing can also be completed this month and year when he uses it, and you personally know how to complete it, so the first person to complete it is you.</p><p>---158---</p><p>In this situation, it is best for women to be a fool, a beautiful fool.</p><p>---159---</p><p>When a weak person is younger than another weak person, it is not the help you seek, but the contempt for others that is a common guilt.</p><p>---160---</p><p>We understand that when we talk about friendship, we only know that when people have the ability to distinguish between things, people and things can also have friendship.</p><p>---161---</p><p>I think I am black.

They are not like the big guys like me. When I was younger, I looked down on them. They are like the cheap smart wit of the city people. They are also very elegant.</p><p>---165---</p><p>When you first meet someone, you often question whether your performance is a little foolish, ashamed of your superficial self who can only see the surface, like oil slick reflecting on a clear pond. In such a situation, it is not always the case. Sometimes, you also think that you are a rare example of a child with talent among many people: the reason for the practice of fighting, the reason for the random walk, and the reason for the big and small, such as ten years later, he can develop the greatness of the person who is not known by others.</p><p>---166---</p><p>I don&#39;t know what the source is, how can I think that the country is the source</p><p>Things are like flowing ten children, you can&#39;t flow through the four tunnels, there is no limit to the universe.</p><p>I don&#39;t know which country is the end, it&#39;s better to stay for ten days</p><p>I am like the wind, blowing through the sand dunes</p><p>---167---</p><p>We all have to strive forward, but there is no way we can be like the child in the boat that is destined to go back.</p><p>---168---</p><p>In those years when I was young and inexperienced, she once gave me a piece of advice when I left. Even now, this advice still lingers in my heart.</p><p>&quot;When you want to criticize someone,&quot; someone said to me, &quot;it seems that you live in a small house. It seems that not everyone here has the advantages that you have.&quot;</p><p>---169---</p><p>I began to say that although such a man lacks the perfect symmetry that only Asian men possess, he still looks down on others. No matter where he goes when he is young, no one can be as handsome as him - he can&#39;t be as handsome as him. To be as talented as him, you don&#39;t have to be clean. The unique sense of cleanliness of a man is due to his beauty.</p><p>---170---</p><p>When you want to criticize someone, come to your home and you will not be like all the people above you, as there are four things in the world that you can open up to.</p><p>---171---</p><p>In the slow dark night of the soul, you see that the wind is blowing at ten o&#39;clock in the morning.</p><p>---172---</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s easy to say, we can grow up in a small way, and there is no difference between the small and logical things. There are also similarities and similarities between the times. One of them combines the best qualities of each of us: yours, my eyes, my brains, your wisdom - and the other is a combination of our shortcomings - mys, your bad temper, my indecision.&quot;</p><p>---173---</p><p>Nicole said that what the child showed was some simple nature, which contained some self-destruction. The little girl wanted to show it so well that people could appreciate a kind of beauty, so in the next year, Mary Zhang was eager to try and follow suit.</p><p>---174---</p><p>There is a situation in which you are born in a certain age.

But my lips could not make any other sound, and what I almost remembered would never come out.</p><p>---257---</p><p>People appear and disappear from time to time, and the plan is to look for each other in the distance. The little guy who looked at the little guy ended up losing sight of the truth. They looked for each other in the distance and found that they were just a few steps away.</p><p>---258---</p><p>I will tell you about the rich. They are not like us. They have been able to possess and enjoy things, and this has had some influence on them, and they have not been kind to those whom we have treated harshly, and they have not been mocked by those whom we have trusted; and unless you are born rich, you cannot understand the nature of these children. We think that we are good for them, and we must find for ourselves the compensation and shelter of our own nature. Even if we go down to our level, or descend to a lower level, we will find that we are good for them. They are not like us. The only way I can describe Anson Henry&#39;s youth is to treat him as a child, and you have to be stubborn and insist on writing from my point of view.</p><p>---259---</p><p>What I really want is that when Gates stands there with his four children, there will be only me and me, alone.</p><p>---260---</p><p>It was almost midnight when a stream of street sweepers trickled down the lonely streets of Fifth Avenue. The shadow of a prostitute passed behind the dark buildings of St. Thomas&#39;s Church. I never saw the deserted bushes of Central Park again—I never played here as a child. The street numbers I saw through the car windows grew larger and larger. These days, the letters have taken on a meaning like names. This is not a city, this is not a family name that has been made famous by five generations of hard work, and it seems like a show of pride. The wind can also change. This is the eternal family in this country. There is no one who is more self-centered. For you, this is also the essence of the thing. I started to say that it was the most essential thing. I underestimated the people and their personnel who bore the name of the family. It was through this that they integrated themselves into the spirit of New York. The cunning and tenacious will of the uncle had shaken off the dust that had accumulated on the name of the uncle, which was greater than the name of the family, and even greater than the dust that was shaken off by the son who was sitting next to the son who was shaking. The threats of the son of the son came from a weak will and as many people as ten people over there. I used a small one to pass four grounds. You used</p><p>---261---</p><p>Most of our lives end in a compromise - some lives especially begin in a compromise.</p><p>---262---</p><p>I want to buy these things, just like a prostitute buying underwear and jewelry. One is to wear fashionable clothes for the next year, and the other is to save some money for my future life. I want to buy these things for a completely different reason. Nicole is the product of ingenuity combined with hard work; in order to realize her dream, the train started through Chicago and crossed the round belly of the American continent to California; the gum factory billowed with smoke, and the connection was growing one section at a time; the men mixed toothpaste and pumped mouthwash, busy in large and small buckets; the women rushed to make canned tomatoes, and on Christmas Eve they worked hard in the cheap stores; the mixed-race Indians toiled on the coffee plantations in Pakistan, and the dreamer invented the new tractor, but he deprived the talents of their rights at the end of the year.</p><p>---263---</p><p>Gates believed in this green light, this idyllic future that is creeping closer and closer to our children. It has eluded us before, but it won&#39;t matter now—if we run a little faster, stretch our arms a little further... or...</p><p>---264---</p><p>Beibei moved her crossed knees - she was the epitome of all the women who had had a crush on Byron a hundred years ago, but she still had a kind of confusion that she couldn&#39;t explain, even though the friendship between them ended so tragically.</p><p>---265---</p><p>I walked out of this place, and I felt both fascinated and disgusted.</p><p>---266---</p><p>&quot;Dick, who underestimates luck, is not a wise man; no one can be so perfect as you are, or even slightly damaged. It is not because of the feeling that you underestimate others that you cannot make them develop. It is not because of the truth or the inferiority complex that you start to have any effect on them. However, it is a good thing that you can rebuild the broken structure better in the next few years.&quot;</p><p>---267---</p><p>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</p><p>So no matter how hard we try, we will never reach the limit, just like children in a boat heading backwards, destined to keep going back to the past.</p><p>---268---</p><p>An aphorism began to beat in my ears, somewhat exciting and thrilling: &quot;Only this month and year when he was pursued, pursued, busy and tired.&quot;</p><p>---269---</p><p>It had escaped our pursuit before, but the wind didn&#39;t matter - it seemed that if we ran a little faster, stretched our arms a little further... it seemed that it would still be there... So we paddled forward as hard as we could, in a small boat floating upstream, without stopping until we had a chance to retreat, until we had a chance to move forward.</p><p>---270---</p><p>It understands you as you wish it would understand you later this month. It trusts you as you wish it would trust you later this month. It learns your heart, and the time you leave it as its mark is the time you wish it would leave you as the mark of no one.</p><p>---271---</p><p>No one criticized you like you did ten years ago. It seems that little boy, not everyone is like you. It is impossible for little things to have such a good life.</p><p>---272---</p><p>We continue to strive forward, against the tide, pushing him into the past. All the glitz and glamour are no match for time, and once you go, you will never come back. Only the pursuers and pursuers, the busy and the tired. When you feel like you want to look down on someone, you should look down on someone else. This person has the qualities you have.</p><p>---273---</p><p>Gates himself finally passed away four years ago. It was understandable that the truth made me temporarily lose interest in people&#39;s brief sorrows and momentary joys. Is it because of this that I began to say that those things that devoured Gates&#39; soul were the foul dust that I used to follow in the disappearing dreams of a country?</p><p>---274---</p><p>I said goodbye to Tiancheng and Tianguo, I barely copied a little bit of my money, and then I sat in the swivel chair and fell asleep. It was almost noon when the thunder woke me up, and I was so scared that cold sweat broke out on my forehead.</p><p>---275---</p><p>I look back on those hours in the afternoon and think of them as not a very pleasant time—a time of no importance or importance, which seemed at the time to be only a link of joy between the past and the future, until it became something else in the end.</p><p>---276---</p><p>There are only pursuers and those who pursue him this month, busy people and tired people between them.</p><p>---277---</p><p>This is a valley of ashes - it seems like a fantastic and strange farm, where the ashes from the burned garbage grow like wheat, forming ridges, hillocks and ugly gardens, and then turning into houses, chimneys and smoke. Finally, I used my extraordinary ability to transform into human form, and the people covered with ashes moved in a blurry manner, like a collapse and shattering in the empty tunnel that seemed to be full of dust. Sometimes, a row of gray carriages slowly drove along an invisible track, making a creaking sound and stopped, and the gray men carrying shovels swarmed over them. An impenetrable gray cloud rises up, obscuring your view, blocking your view of the puzzling movements of different individuals.</p><p>---278---</p><p>Gates believed in that green light when he was young, and that green light was like the future he had hoped for when he was young, which was fading away year after year before our children. It has eluded us now, and it doesn&#39;t matter if you have the upper hand - it seems that we can trot faster and stretch our arms longer... and there is still such a clear morning -</p><p>We were there when we started out, and the boat was sailing in a circle, going against the tide, and we were pushed forward by the waves.</p><p>---279---</p><p>At the end of your dock there is a green light that stays on all night.</p><p>---280---</p><p>When you want to say something to someone you don&#39;t know, think about your good things.</p><p>---281---</p><p>When I started the novel back in the fall of last year, I didn&#39;t want to be like a person who had just come out of college and wore underwear, as I always do, morally speaking.</p><p>---282---</p><p>I still think that Gates himself didn&#39;t believe in the phone, and maybe he felt that he was wrong. If my assumption is wrong, then he must have realized the truth. It turns out that there is a place behind that warm image, and he has paid a high price for having a dream for too long.</p><p>---283---</p><p>So we are all struggling in the reversible boat, and we are destined to keep looking down on each other and never go back to the past.</p><p>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</p><p>---284---</p><p>The sun shines brightly, and green leaves emerge from the branches, just like everything in a movie is growing rapidly.</p><p>---285---</p><p>It was like an inefficient pickpocket, who was more likely to escape in the chaotic and crowded carnival crowd. The chimney began to smoke, the mess of the railway became clean again, the actress performed a new play, the publishing house published a new book, the upper-class mansion led a new dance, the railway also changed its shift schedule, and new mistakes appeared to replace the old mistakes that everyone was used to.</p><p>---286---</p><p>I think the most fascinating thing is to underestimate the exciting and high-spirited child. For you, it is something that is impossible to achieve no matter how hard you try to develop your dreams - the talent of this child is an eternal song.</p><p>---287---</p><p>As they ate their biscuits and drank their slushies, they stood with Mary. Dick Diver looked at her with his calm blue eyes. After some consideration and deliberation, the kindly little mouth of the man uttered the following words: &quot;You have been away from her for a long time. This is the first time I have seen a girl as beautiful as you. You are like a blooming flower.&quot;</p><p>---288---</p><p>美国人，虽在如是四地愿意甚种是渴望去当奴隶，四地道你上一得外是坚决不一孩了有边才四地道得乡巴佬的。</p><p>---289---</p><p>Xiaokanxiang&#39;s gray eyes squinted in the sun this month, focusing on the past and the present, Xiaokanxiang&#39;s words changed our relationship, and at that moment, I think I fell in love with Xiaokanxiang. I am a stupid person, and I have many human principles in my heart, which restrain my desires.</p><p>---290---</p><p>Four ways, if you are a person like ten winds, you should walk less and have a virtue within a month.</p><p>---291---</p><p>The only still thing in the room was a huge sofa, on which a woman was floating, as if she were sitting on a hot ball. The woman was wearing a white dress, and her skirt was fluttering in the wind, as if they had flown around the room and the wind had just blown them back. I stood there listening to the sound of the curtains flapping, and the creaking of a painting on the wall. I must have stood there for a long time. Suddenly, with a bang, Tom Buchanan closed the window outside. The remaining wind in the room gradually blew in the curtains, blankets and the old woman&#39;s warm balls, which slowly fell back to the ground.</p><p>---292---</p><p>I ran to the front door of the lawn that was larger than the beach. I ran for about a hundred meters, crossed the sundial, brick path and gorgeous garden, and finally ran to the front of the house. As if using the momentum of running, I jumped into the green vines and continued to grow. In front of me, a row of French windows with green walls were broken by the windows, shining brightly...</p><p>---293---</p><p>It was a photo of the house, with the corners broken off and it was obvious that it had passed through many hands. I was eager to point out a wonderful detail to her and said, &quot;Look how beautiful it is!&quot; My eyes were bigger than my own and I was looking for something to say in approval. I don&#39;t know how many times scholars have seen this photo I took out, so I think this photo is even more important to me now, as I didn&#39;t want this house when I left.</p><p>---294---</p><p>Human nature can be built on solid rock or on wet swamps, but once you have reached a certain level, you no longer care what you build it on.</p><p>---295---</p><p>Don&#39;t you know that everyone in the struggle for survival is drunken from beginning to end?</p><p>---296---</p><p>People are still eager to move from one stage to another. This is to push the whole process to an end. People are still constantly looking forward to it, and they are constantly feeling hopeful. They are no longer like this, so they have a very nervous and fearful heart when the end comes.</p><p>---297---</p><p>If you want to tell a story that is different from anyone else&#39;s, tell it in a different language than anyone else&#39;s.</p><p>---298---</p><p>It seemed to be the wisest and most beautiful idea of ​​all women, like a beautiful curtain hanging on my door, blocking the bright sunlight from my eyes. In the first year of our marriage, I thought that after four years, it was a sign of Grace; I still saw the sun in a different way through the curtains.</p><p>---299---</p><p>So, I gradually developed the habit of not making arbitrary comments on others. As a result, many strange people opened their hearts to me, and some people who looked down on me treated me as a person to confide in. When this quality is revealed in a decent person, those mentally disordered people will be noticed immediately, which is not good for this kind of experience.</p><p>---300---</p><p>Xiaokan lay on the sofa, motionless, with his chin slightly raised, as if he was weighing something and was afraid it would fall.</p><p>---301---</p><p>It is precisely this kind of fantasy that makes the image so bright. You don&#39;t need to use it in this way to make it look like this. It&#39;s just that the little thing is stained with that magical brilliance.</p><p>---302---</p><p>It is impossible for a playboy who has become a womanizer to change his ways, unless he is tired of it - he is no longer himself after he has looked down upon it - and now only a shell of himself remains.</p><p>---303---</p><p>The empty child has only one side and only four sides to think of the country. Look at the child in the spring. The child has only one side and only four sides to think of the country. The rest is just the cuteness of tiredness.</p><p>---304---</p><p>He matured early and was a poet when he was 18 years old.</p><p>---305---</p><p>We never catch up with it, and it has something to do with your advantage - obviously now we can trot faster and stretch our hands farther... Wait until some beautiful morning</p><p>---306---</p><p>If you think you have a basic virtue, it&#39;s because I underestimate you: I am an honest person, and there are not many people who have this talent, and I happen to be one of them.</p><p>---307---</p><p>Day after day, it always opens late at night.</p><p>---308---</p><p>&quot;I love summer in New York, where people run away like crazy. It&#39;s so sexy - a ripe taste, like all kinds of fruits have just fallen into your hands.&quot;</p><p>---309---</p><p>So, we worked hard, and he went against the waves and went back to the past.</p><p>---310---</p><p>&quot;I want to know your soul with that jelly-roll hair, and big brown eyes, and I want to be the girl in the gumdrops girl group - my Jenny lives in gumdrops town.&quot;</p><p>---311---</p><p>Gates believed in the green light, the blissful future that was looming before us. So it eluded us, even the wind had something to do with us—and now we were running faster, stretching our arms further… On a fine morning—</p><p>So we are all struggling in the reversible boat, and we are destined to keep looking down on each other and never go back to the past.</p><p>---312---</p><p>I know myself, and I know that you are just underestimating me.</p><p>---313---</p><p>My father told me those truths when I was young and vulnerable, and I&#39;ve been thinking about his advice ever since. &quot;You know you&#39;re not the one who wants to criticize,&quot; he told me, &quot;you&#39;re the kid who lives in a house like me: people like you have your own advantages.&quot; He didn&#39;t say anything, and although we didn&#39;t spend much time together, we still talked about things in different ways, and I realized that there was something else in our lives that made us feel happy.</p><p>---314---</p><p>Still, we are the ones who go with the flow. If the thorns on our backs cannot be sharpened, then they can be softened. But our hearts are always asking us to get more happiness. I don&#39;t know what I want. I feel uneasy and bored shuttling between men. Truth comes and goes. The tacit understanding between me and my boyfriends is getting less and less, and the dislike for each other is increasing. I have to sit alone in a corner and think, biting my cheeks, thinking about it. If I keep going like this, I will definitely go crazy - I have experienced the changes in life. I have a terrible sobriety.</p><p>---315---</p><p>Now I finally understand, this is the story of how Tom, Gates, Daisy, Jordan and I were all made up. Maybe we have some common shortcomings that make us feel that we are not suitable for each other.</p><p>---316---</p><p>Unlike American trains that run as fast as they can, looking down on those who don&#39;t run as fast as they can, this train traversed the countryside and blended into it, its breath brushing the dust off the palm leaves and its coal ash mixed with manure and spread over the garden.</p><p>---317---</p><p>When humans first saw this continent, they must have held their breath for a moment, and couldn&#39;t help but fall into a kind of beauty and contemplation that they could neither understand nor desire. For the first time in history, they had to face some kind of surprise that was beyond their reach.</p><p>---318---</p><p>I must have looked up through those terrible leaves and found the sky so strange; I must have felt a chill when I found the roses so ugly and the sunlight shining on the sparse grass so cruel. It was like being in a new world, a real and false world, in which the poor ghost breathed the dreams of the empty child, floating around in the world...</p><p>---319---</p><p>For a moment, I wanted to sink into that bright blue world of the twins, to have something else in my heart, and to feel at ease.</p><p>---320---</p><p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I&#39;ve been turning over in my mind ever since.&#39;Whenever you feel like judging anyone,&#39; he told me, &#39;just remember that all the people in this world haven&#39;t had the advantages that you&#39;ve had.&#39;</p><p>---321---</p><p>This is a rare expression, a quality of a permanent nature, which you may only see once in your life. For a moment, this expression confronts or seems to confront the whole thing, and in this way it focuses on your departure a favorite, irresistible preference. It understands you just as you want it to, just as you believe in yourself, and you are guaranteed that it has just the right impression on you, and this impression is what you most want to convey.</p><p>---322---</p><p>All of them are a bunch of bastards, and all of them combined can&#39;t even afford to fuck you in a month.</p><p>---323---</p><p>With the bright sunshine, large clusters of leaves grew on the trees - could I have started to grow quickly like in the movies? Then the familiar belief returned to my mind: summer is coming, and life is starting again.</p><p>---324---</p><p>I had come a long way to this blue lawn, and my dream must have seemed so close, so near that I could not miss it. I did not know that my dream had landed in this place, in this city, in the darkness and darkness of the four directions, and the dark fields of my dream stretched out before me in the night.</p><p>---325---</p><p>A person&#39;s principles may be based on solid rock or on damp swamps. After a certain point, I no longer care what my future is based on.</p><p>---326---</p><p>Gates believed in the green light, which marked the exciting future that was receding before us year by year. It was bigger than before, and it had something to do with the wind. Now we can run faster, our arms can stretch longer, and there is still a beautiful morning in this country...</p><p>---327---</p><p>In the pretentious back country, I used the wind to hide something else, that is, there was also wind over there when it started.</p><p>---328---</p><p>So at that time, in the midst of a shattered dream and the drifting dirty dust of the ten countries</p><p>---329---</p><p>For this reason, we have to work hard to move forward, to go against the current, and to push back the waves as time goes by.</p><p>---330---</p><p>With the bright sunshine and the new green leaves of the trees - things are growing rapidly as if in a fast-forwarded movie - a familiar thought comes to mind: life is beginning to renew itself with the summer.</p><p>---331---</p><p>There is no fundamental difference between people and things, whether in terms of intelligence or race, but the difference between them is not as profound as the difference between people and health.</p><p>---332---</p><p>It seems that when we are younger, we run faster and stretch our arms farther... On a beautiful morning -</p><p>---333---</p><p>I miss you is just a casual remark, but there is a warmth in your heart, as if my love is hidden in the breathtaking and touching words, and there is nothing else to miss you.</p><p>---334---</p><p>I put my hands in my pockets and walked out of the house, as if my presence would detract from the holy vigil. So I opened my eyes, thinking of the light above my head standing there - guarding you.</p><p>---335---</p><p>Sometimes I feel lonely because I can&#39;t get rid of it, and I feel lonely because no one can share my loneliness.</p><p>---336---</p><p>Therefore, we are like a small boat going against the current. Although we are constantly pushed back in time, we still have a lot to gain as long as we keep working hard.</p><p>---337---</p><p>I&#39;m in it, in it, in it&#39;s place, I&#39;ve got the child, I&#39;m intoxicated and disgusted with the fantasy of life.</p><p>---338---</p><p>Things started like this, and we drove through the gradually cooling twilight and drove out into death.</p><p>---339---</p><p>Once a person is thrown into a place where he does not belong, he will feel like he has lost his soul and cannot control himself.</p><p>---340---</p><p>Staying at the station, thinking of the country, I used to think of Paris, and the situation looked as if we were walking out of the sea, as if we were experiencing a huge excrement, like some atoms and positrons moving around in the sky, forming the basic molecules of a new race.</p><p>---341---</p><p>The little boy&#39;s talent, gestures and speech became more and more artificial as he grew older. The little boy&#39;s figure gradually expanded and the room around him became as small as a small box. In the end, in the smoke, the little boy&#39;s simple lamp was like a lantern in his youth, turning on a creaking wooden axis.</p><p>---342---</p><p>To me, courage is the most powerful thing that can lift the dark and dreary fog in life - not only the control of oneself and the environment, but also the control of the desolation of life. The value of life is also the pursuit of a part of energy and value.</p><p>---343---</p><p>I could not sleep all night. A series of horns moaned over the channel, and I felt as if something had happened to me.
