integrityhe used to tell us that these values were more important than any riches at the age of 31 zweli mhkize had already completed his degree in medicine at the university of natal by 1983 his internship at the mccord hospital was completed this was important since mccord was a bastion of equality and often got reprimanded for disobeying the group areas act mhkize ended up gaining employment at edendale hospital in his hometown of pietermaritzburg in the following year despite his accomplishments at edendale life was not safe for a successful young black doctor due to the apartheid movement he was forced into exile in swaziland eventually settling in zimbabwe before returning in 1991 to south africaupon his return to south africa he began to network and build contacts within the anc as a member of the anc national health secretariat zweli mhkize is also very close friends with jacob zuma as they hail from the same province without a doubt mhkize was one of the main

it is not possible for him to lead our province and to take a strong line against corruption when he has such serious allegations hanging over his own head reiterating his original view that there needs to be a full and urgent investigation into whether this was an established strategyin this province and whether there are other instances where government tenders have been awarded based on party political favours mhkize has also been criticized for spending over 1 million dollars in public funds over the use of private airplanes over 40 trips between 2010 and 2013 democratic alliance leader sizwe mchunu went as far as stating it was an abuse of public fundscompletely inappropriate and excessive after the private airplane scandal came out in the news zweli mhkize offered to

delhi he is a graduate of national school of drama new delhi india and the canadian film centre toronto canadaas a kid growing up in delhi vipin always wanted to be in the movies he used to hear stories of kids running away from homes and landing up in bombay but he never thought of doing it as he knew it would hurt his parents badly he grew up in delhi watching the movies on television every sunday the trouble was there was no electricity in his own house so he had to rely on his neighbors and it was their choice to let him in or not one sunday he found out that there was a very unique hindi film achanak was to be shown which had no songs at all it was unheard of in those to have a film without a song whereas a separate show called chitrahar was dedicated entirely to songs on doordarshan he wasnt allowed in any of the houses angry he broke someones front gate in lajpat nagar where he grew up and ran away it was this and many other humiliating experiences that he decided that one day the same people who dont allow him to watch television in their homes will be watching him on it one dayacting was always on vipins mind and like thousands his inspiration was also amitabh bachchan even as a kid i would go for movies without telling my father and later he used to beat me up but i was really passionate about it he went to delhi university but his love for acting didnt help much there also as he was rusticated due to the shortage of attendance as he was busy doing a play he was also disillusioned with the entire education system which kept teaching the same thing over and over again he quit college and was fortunate to be selected to study at one of the most amazing acting schools in the country the national school of drama nsd influenced him greatly it surely put him on the right path that is where he came in touch with some of the most important filmmakers and actors of our times like shyam benegal ketan mehta prakash jha naseerudding shah om puri bv karanth barry john to name a few this is also where he flourished as an actor and soon after he graduated he was hired by the madhya pradesh rangmandal a theatre repertory company where he performed all around the country for a year or so again disillusioned by a structured work place he decided to leave and travel around in the country and abroad that is when he went to berlin and studied experimental cinema there for about a year or so upon his return he started his career by assisting ketan mehta in one of the most memorable film of nfdc mirch masala he was with him again on another path breaking film of bollywood hero hiralal acting continued in between and he acted in shayam benegals discovery of india and yatra his portrayal of rama krishna paramhamsa got him rave reviews and mr benegal cast him in carmen along with om puri and nina gupta the film never got made and disillusioned with acting and bollywood of late 80s he now wanted to do something different in toronto he tried different hats and finally became an editor after having attended another very popular norman jewison film school canadian film centre but during all that time acting stayed in his mind and he always thought may be one day he will go back to it and he is back now all this happened because of a chance meeting with one of the most amazing acting teachers he had come across jacqueline mcclintock from montreal who teaches meisner it changed his life vipin studied with her for a bit and decided to pack his bags and head to bollywoodhis first major role was as nandakishore avasti in taare zameen par like stars on earth for his role in the film he was nominated for a 2009 star screen award for best supporting actortaare was a windfall he had no idea that it was going to happen when he first arrived in india he remembers his first day on the shoot there were these huge lights and he was standing with aamir and amole who was then directing the film it felt surrealin taare zameen par he played a dyslexic childs father but he was not the first choice for the character written by amole gupte and directed by aamir khan the movie was not a typical entertainer but it turned out to be one of the biggest hits of 2007 as it carried an important message and was like an eyeopener for many recalling the audition he said i was not called to play the part i was actually asked to audition for the hindi teacher but i requested amole to let me audition for that part too he gave me some lines and asked me to come prepared the next day the next day amole was not there but i still auditioned for the role it was my luck that aamir saw the audition clip and asked amole to let me play that part i guess i will always be remembered for my role in taare zameen par and honestly because of the film i did not have to struggle a lot he addedby the time i did jannat it was still a bit strange i had refused it but i am glad i did it i remember soon after jannat released i was driving in bombay and stopped at a cross light a group of street kids who sell umbrellas books and many other things on these junctions came running towards me i first thought they wanted to sell me their merchandise but soon they told me that they had loved my hamam soap dialog in it i was quite amazed by how much bollywood movies have actually become part of the life in india i mean these kids are not educated and are poor but they see every filmin the movie john day vipin sharma and makrand despande were described as being very engaging in their supporting rolesi dont want to do mindless cinema i want to do something that has a message my character should convey a message to the society vipin last seen in john day as a police officer told ians in a telephonic interview from mumbai having said that i understand that all the movies cannot have a message but then again i dont want to do something that doesnt make any sense he addedacting in such films is like driving through the mumbai traffic where many people are unnecessarily honking quips sharma as we talk about the standards of acting in mainstream cinema see acting is one profession where you dont have to do what your designation suggests an engineer is supposed to do engineering but an actor should not act he has to constantly struggle to minimize the acting part unfortunately many dont understand this in our industry perhaps thats why many still call a supporting actor a character artist it is an archaic term which has lost its meaningi look for something interesting something unique the character should create some arc it has to be very realistic i just see what kind of human being my character is and if i like it i accept it he saidan alumnus of the national school of drama vipin sharma feels that formal training in the craft is vital for every actorif you have a dental problem will you go to an untrained dentist no then why go for an untrained actor training is hugely important for an actors career there is something very intriguing about a trained actor vipin told he added one can easily distinguish between a trained and an untrained actor training gives a depth to their performance so i feel that every actor should undergo a formal trainingi am mostly working with indie filmmakers in bollywood now and that is where i am finding my likemindedness i dont hate mainstream cinema but it very rarely offers films that are greatly entertaining and enlightening at the same time just aiming to entertain through an art form is shallow and doesnt contribute much to any society in a country like india where there are so many issues that need to be looked into there is a great need of cinema which reflects that i am attempting to be part of this new age cinema that is fast emerging here i am also slowly going back to performing on stage and soon will be directing my first film as well see more at
