I returned to Nansheng with this belief. With this belief, we young people can certainly cut a piece of hope and stone from the ridge of despair and despair. With this belief, we young people can certainly turn the harsh quarrels in this country into a beautiful symphony filled with brotherhood and love.</p><p>---031---</p><p>It seems that there is no advantage in having talent.

Interested people always ask if they can get benefits. Invaders always ask if they can get benefits. In the end, I use my little to ask if it is correct. I have a look at people.

Today we are gathered here in front of the statue of the Lord. This solemn declaration is like the light of a beacon, bringing hope to millions of black slaves who were suffering in the injustice and fire that destroyed their lives. Its arrival was like a joyful dawn, ending the long night of bondage for black people.</p><p>---046---</p><p>I have a dream</p><p>that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:</p><p>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.&quot;</p><p>---047---</p><p>We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope.

It is the excessive silence of good people.</p><p>---055---</p><p>If you limit riots and do not push aside moral principles, you will not be able to win. Those in power know this. You are not going to underestimate the revolution. It is a kind of &quot;reverse&quot; and it involves victory and defeat. It is a kind of emotional catharsis. The result is bound to be like this. It is a kind of futility and oversight. You can feel it.</p><p>---056---</p><p>The greater the group of children, the more real the situation is, and the freedom of family learning begins.</p><p>---057---</p><p>We can accept the truth, but our hope for the truth is limited; we must never underestimate and reject hope, but our hope for the truth is beyond our limits.</p><p>---058---</p><p>In the end, what I used to live with was not our friends&#39; natural foreign language, but our friends&#39; silence.</p><p>---059---</p><p>We underestimated the confidence that we have.</p><p>The truth that chiseled the big piece of despair into hope is just a piece of the boy&#39;s four-story building.</p><p>---060---</p><p>If your dream is still standing there, I will use it, and no one can make you fall.</p><p>---061---</p><p>Men must devolve for all human conflict, a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation, the foundation of such a method, is love.</p><p>Human beings must abandon all conflicts and struggles, find ways to reject aggression and revenge, and underestimate the foundation of this evolutionary law, which is love.</p><p>---062---</p><p>I still have a big dream, I can tell you how much fire you can limit in four places.</p><p>---063---</p><p>I dream that one day, when this country is like this, I will be able to use it as a platform, and only then will I be able to realize the truth that &quot;we are not underestimated, and life will be good for everyone.&quot;</p><p>I dream that one day, on the red hill in Georgia, the young sons of former slaves will be able to sit down with the young sons of former slaves who have been separated from them and talk about brotherhood.</p><p>I dream that one day I will see how this state, where justice disappears and oppression prevails, will become an oasis of freedom and justice.</p><p>I dream of a day when I grow up, when I am a kid, I will be a country that is not judged by the color of our skin, but by the quality of our character.</p><p>Now, I have a dream.
