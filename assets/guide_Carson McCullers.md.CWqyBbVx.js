Some people you have met, when you think back to them, only a feeling remains, and you still can&#39;t believe it?</p><p>---007---</p><p>The heart is a hunter of loneliness. Loneliness is absolute. Even the deepest love can never change. The heart is the ultimate loneliness of human beings. Desperate loneliness is not so much the original sin as the original sin of the original sin. After the loneliness, the individual is no longer lonely. This similar loneliness will make me feel lonely after the loneliness. People are lonely after all, just as people are dead after all. In the past, we looked down on some things. It was only then that we felt that this was a kind of subtlety and wisdom. Now we feel a kind of cunning and mockery. This gradually warmed our hearts and made us drowsy. Anxiety slowly turned into fatigue. In our eyes, we can see a deep sense of calmness.</p><p>---008---</p><p>Loneliness is the main road of life.

A good person can also be the trigger of a licentious and depraved love, and a nagging lunatic can certainly make someone think of a gentle and beautiful pastoral. I call it another thing, because the value and quality of a love depends purely on the age of the lovers.</p><p>---013---</p><p>The young mind of a child is a delicate organ, and the cruel wind twists their minds into strange shapes. A wounded child&#39;s heart shrinks into this: it will never be like a peach pit, one that is not hard and one that is not full of deep grooves.</p><p>---014---</p><p>Rucheng fell on the road, looking at the road too much, thinking it was too big. Rucheng realized that he was looking at the face of Shao Jue on the glass of the counter in front of him. The left side would recall the past, and the right side would stare at the future in fear - the dark, wrong, and shattered future. It was hanging between light and darkness to Shao Jue, between sarcastic ridicule and faith to Shao Jue.</p><p>---015---</p><p>Just like that, most of us would rather love you than be loved. Almost none of us would like to be the lover. It is not so simple, people feel that the situation of being loved is unbearable for many people. The lover fears and hates the lover, which is also reasonable. The lover wants to strip the beloved to the bare soul. The lover craves more than possible relationship with the lover, even if this experience can only bring pain to himself.</p><p>---016---</p><p>&quot;There are some things we don&#39;t want others to know. I&#39;m not calling them bad, we just want to keep them secret. There&#39;s no way we can tell anyone about that, even if it&#39;s you, I won&#39;t tell you.&quot;</p><p>---017---</p><p>Rucheng has his own loneliness, the so-called heart-to-heart connection.</p><p>It&#39;s not just a passing mistake.</p><p>---018---</p><p>The wings grow on your shoulders, but you care too much about the criticism of scholars about your posture when flying. That is why you cannot fly.</p><p>---019---</p><p>The left frame will reminisce about the past, and the right frame will gaze fearfully at the future - a dark, wrong, and shattered future, suspended between light and darkness, between sarcastic ridicule and faith.</p><p>---020---</p><p>First of all, there are lovers and there are those who are in love. This is a very different view of people. In fact, those who are in love are just a kind of trigger of love that has been accumulated for a long time in the heart of lovers. A person in love will not know this after the beginning. If you feel it in the depths of your soul, the love you feel is a feeling that makes others lonely. The value and quality of a love relationship depends purely on the age of the lovers themselves.</p><p>---021---</p><p>We are not just sad people of color.</p><p>---022---</p><p>Love is a common experience that occurs between individuals - but to say that it is a common experience does not mean that it causes the same reaction in the individuals concerned. First of all, there are lovers and there are those who are called lovers, and these are truly different types of people. It can be seen that those who are called lovers are just a trigger of love that has been accumulated in the heart of the lover for a long time. Later, a person in love will not know this to any extent. In the depths of his soul, he feels that his love is a feeling that makes others lonely. He gradually experiences a new and unfamiliar loneliness, and it is this discovery that makes him suffer.</p><p>---023---</p><p>There are two kinds of people: those who know and those who don&#39;t know. You know, when we know each other, it&#39;s an event. It simply cannot happen. Sometimes we meet, but we never thought that we are the ones who know each other. Time is lingering. I call it some people have an instinct: they want to throw away all their private feelings at certain moments; before they ferment and corrode, throw them to someone or something else. I think we have to do this. It can be a quarrel or an argument. I feel that we are like this, not saying a word, not sitting, not going to the temple, and arguing about something when we are in the temple.</p><p>---024---</p><p>I can only stand up for you, I can&#39;t stand loneliness. I told others to hurry up and go see you. I only have six days off, but I can open the door a little earlier. I think I can only stand up for you. I don&#39;t deserve to be alone, I don&#39;t deserve to be without you.</p><p>---025---</p><p>Resentment is the most precious flower of poverty.</p><p>---026---</p><p>Loneliness is absolute, and the deepest love is the ultimate loneliness of human beings. Even if this happens, we are not alone, music and love can still move and warm us!</p><p>---027---</p><p>People are drifting around and can&#39;t get by without calling me a limit, but when you call me a limit, you actually make people drift around and can&#39;t get by without me.</p><p>---028---</p><p>If some of us die, no one will die.</p><p>---029---</p><p>Life is nothing but absorption, nourishment and production. You are now in the heart of me. To a large extent, there is no doubt. Perhaps the word mature is more appropriate. It is not that the heart is not that I really have not played it. The eyes will swell in the ears of the people and retreat in the heart. Maturity. The eyes of the people will be stinging, as if the body is also excited and the heart is not too bright.</p><p>---030---</p><p>In this way, the lover can be any type of person. The most uncivilized person can also be the trigger of love. A trembling man who wants to be a man may still fall in love with a strange girl that Rucheng saw on the streets of Qihuo one afternoon two years ago. Mu Xin may also fall in love with a degenerate woman. The person who loves in his youth may be a bad person, slick and tainted with bad habits. Yes, lovers can also be as clear as students about everything - but this does not affect the development of Rucheng&#39;s feelings at all.</p><p>---031---</p><p>There is only one thing that is good for lovers. You must not keep your love locked up in your heart as much as possible; you must create for yourself a whole new reality - a new reality that is student-like, strange, and entirely yours. I have to add that the lover we are talking about does not necessarily have to be a young person saving money for a wedding ring - this lover can be a man, a woman, a child, or even just that person.</p><p>---032---</p><p>If Rucheng cannot tell the whole story of the students, then Rucheng would rather remain silent.</p><p>---033---</p><p>Some things you just naurally want to keep private. Not because they are bad, but because you just want them secret.</p><p>There are some things we all want to keep secret from others. I&#39;m not calling them bad, we just want to keep them secret.</p><p>---034---</p><p>Although the surface of this love affair is tragic, you must remember that the true story of the students is the soul of the lover himself. For this or all the love affairs of the students, who can be the ultimate judge except God?</p><p>---035---</p><p>Seeing more and more, calling love over and over again is just the trigger that has been accumulating for a long time in the lover&#39;s heart.</p><p>---036---</p><p>When facing someone you are not close to, it is easier to vent your anger.</p><p>---037---</p><p>A person’s got to fight for every single thing they get.</p><p>A person must fight for the way to success only after he has realized it and his heart is calling for help.</p><p>---038---</p><p>They didn&#39;t talk, they didn&#39;t talk, and the man looked lonely. The distrust between the man who had just woken up and the man who had just finished a long night cast a great sense of alienation in his heart. The half-drawn curtains and the gratings on the window made the light on the window soft. Sometimes he was in awe and humility and wanted to be at peace with himself. Sometimes he was proud - never cherish a love that was not picky and not controlled by his will. The silence in the room seemed unfathomable to him like the night. He was so stunned that he fell into deep thought. Suddenly, he felt a throbbing. He felt a little dizzy and leaned against the counter to support himself.</p><p>---039---</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t be lonely on the road, and I shouldn&#39;t be without you - my soulmate.</p><p>---040---</p><p>Each minute was so long that in it there was ample time for contemplation and enquiry.</p><p>After the road is opened, the minutes are not so long at all, and there is enough time to ponder and consult God.</p><p>---041---</p><p>Why? Lovers, there are many who go together, why do you still want to kill the one who doesn&#39;t follow you? Just to bury the dead who can&#39;t be saved? To perform a funeral ceremony that must be completed? To kill the one who can&#39;t be saved seems to have been put on a temporary stage, and the eyes will expand in seconds. You still want to watch for many years? To kill the one who can&#39;t be saved to fulfill the responsibility of the people? Or, to kill the one who can&#39;t be saved, you must die for the lover&#39;s revenge - to kill the one who can&#39;t be saved, you still want the soul that can&#39;t be saved to grow and reborn, why?</p><p>---042---</p><p>&quot;How many of us are there in this country? Maybe ten thousand. Maybe ten thousand. Maybe more. I&#39;ve been to more than ten of them, and I&#39;ve only met a few of us. Talk about what a student knows. Think of it as the way it was, as you go back thousands of years and think about its evolution. Watch the slow accumulation of capital and power, and see it rise to its peak today. America is a madhouse in its own right. We&#39;ve seen people rob their brothers to survive. We&#39;ve seen hungry children working six hours a week to get enough food.</p><p>---043---</p><p>已经过去五个为大二大和一然把这起了。这些日子我一打路过过著不格们有你的孤单生以天。我惟一能想像的是，我可以十不和你在一起的时刻。如果我不能叫别人快去看你，我不知如多到那是好。</p><p>---044---</p><p>I been to a lot of places but I never met but a few of us.</p><p>I&#39;ve been to places where people asked others to do more than ten things but didn&#39;t make the way for me. In fact, I&#39;ve only met people who asked others to do less.</p><p>---045---</p><p>My loneliness was all played on this mute, and I was confused. &quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about. I only know you, my only friend. Now I don&#39;t even know you anymore.&quot; I thought Singer was someone who could understand me, but I didn&#39;t know that Singer was also trapped by his loneliness. I didn&#39;t know it at the time. Maybe I just hypnotized myself to satisfy my desire to talk, thinking that this quiet and silent Singer could see through everything.</p><p>---046---</p><p>Give birth to an ungrateful son, don&#39;t be too suspicious, the teeth of a poisonous snake are more hurtful.</p><p>---047---</p><p>The best feelings in life come from this feeling and the heart is free. Like all general rules, this statement is both true and false.</p><p>---048---</p><p>Everbody haves feelings—no matter who they is—and nobody is going to walk in no house where they certain their feelings will be hurt.</p><p>After the road is opened, no one can have feelings, no matter who Rucheng is - no one wants to say that the heart is still open. No one wants to stand up for Rucheng, knowing that you are hurt.</p><p>---049---</p><p>I think some people have an instinct: they want to throw away all their private feelings at a certain moment; throw them to someone, or something, before they ferment and corrode. Portia said to Mick: &quot;But you have never loved God, nor have you ever loved people. You are as hard as a cowhide. No matter what you do, Walker sees through you. In the afternoon, you ran around everywhere, and nothing could satisfy your heart. You walked around, as if you had to find the feeling of abandonment, and you were so excited that you made yourself more and more excited. Your heart beat faster and you almost died. I think you didn&#39;t love, and you couldn&#39;t have peace. As a result, this feeling of you exploded like a ball and collapsed completely.</p><p>---050---</p><p>This person who sees too much and opens his eyes a minute later is born to be easily deceived.</p><p>---051---</p><p>Life can also be a long process of trying to keep yourself alive. But there is one thing that puzzles people: all useful things have a price, and you can&#39;t buy them without money. This is the first reason. A bale of cotton and a quart of syrup have their prices. You know how these prices are determined, so you don&#39;t need to worry about them. But how much is a person&#39;s life worth? No one has set a price for it; it is given to you by the people, and it will be paid back when it is taken back. How much is it worth? If you look around carefully, you will find that sometimes it is worth only a few dollars, or even nothing at all. Sometimes you are so tired that you sweat, and you have worked hard, but nothing seems to be working. At this time, you will suddenly feel a sense in your heart: your life is not worth much.</p><p>---052---</p><p>If the memories that Xiang had called up hit me, it was not the clarity of my memories, but the fact that they had brought together a long period of time, a complete whole. I felt that I had been with him for a long time. Now our life together was complete, and only the past could be complete. Life was just absorption, nourishment and production. In reality, these things did not happen in &quot;her room&quot;. With music, her country and my plans, my eyes would switch. It seemed that I was waiting in some way - in reality, I didn&#39;t know what I was waiting for. I knew that this time had not been in vain. I felt a deep sense of satisfaction that I had lived well together.</p><p>---053---</p><p>If you want to make a good start in life, you must have a firm grasp on the situation. If you don&#39;t protect yourself, you will not be able to make it.</p><p>---054---</p><p>A crackling orange flame filled the grate.</p><p>---055---</p><p>Communication is the only way to see more love.</p><p>---056---</p><p>Human struggle and courage will open the way; humanity will be eternal and will not flow away; time will open the way to the river of time; we will not stand up for those who work hard; we will not stand up for those who love us. At the same time, I feel the warning of danger, the arrow of fear. I fall on the second person and think too much, I realize that I am looking at the face of the counter glass in front of me. The left side will recall the past, the right side will gaze fearfully at the future - a dark, wrong, and shattered future, suspended between light and darkness, between sarcastic ridicule and faith.</p><p>---057---</p><p>Love is a common experience that occurs between two individuals.</p><p>---058---</p><p>Desperate loneliness is not so much an original sin as it is the original sin of original sin.</p><p>---059---</p><p>I call it a special kind of instinct that some people have: they want to throw away all their private self-consciousness at a certain moment; before they ferment and corrode to the point of collapse, throw them to someone, or something else.</p><p>---060---</p><p>Resentment is the most precious flower of poverty.</p><p>Resentment is the most precious flower of poverty.</p><p>---061---</p><p>I don&#39;t understand why we can&#39;t be good students and have good students&#39; hearts and minds when we go to Shao.</p><p>---062---</p><p>I just want to stand up for you, I can&#39;t stand being alone.</p><p>---063---</p><p>You care too much about the criticism of your scholars on your posture after you open up the road to the people, so you can&#39;t fly.</p><p>---064---</p><p>It was strange to others that you were so lonely in a crowded house. Mick tried to think of a hidden place where he could go, stay alone, and study the song. He thought about it for a long time, but Xiao Yi and he knew that this place didn&#39;t exist.</p><p>---065---</p><p>But the main thing he sees is that the whole system of the world is built on a lie.And although it’s as plain as the shining sun—the don’t-knows have lived with that lie so long they just can’t see it.’</p><p>The most important thing we all think is that we are the ones who see the most: the whole system is built on a lie. Although this lie is obvious to you - it shines like the sun on us - those who don&#39;t know us will pass by and live in it, but we can&#39;t see it.</p><p>---066---</p><p>Death is not death to us, it&#39;s just a matter of time, in fact, after a person has made his own way of death, he will have no choice but to die.</p><p>---067---</p><p>Strong feelings do not necessarily mean a fair and just stand up for the greater good.</p><p>---068---</p><p>The most powerful one, Rucheng, said: &quot;This is my suggestion to you. Don&#39;t stand up and try to be alone and be yourself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But--&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, there are no buts.&quot; Doctor Copeland said in a didactic tone, &quot;The most fatal thing a person can do is to try to isolate herself.&quot;</p><p>---069---</p><p>It&#39;s good to have a feeling that once belonged to someone.</p><p>---070---</p><p>If you are a person who is good at what you do, you will feel that you have heard things that no one has ever heard, and you know things that no one can imagine. If you are a person who is a little bit secretive, you will feel that you have heard things that no one has ever heard.</p><p>---071---</p><p>A few days ago, it was a dark rainy night. Rucheng had just come back from delivering a baby and was standing in the rain on the street corner. Rucheng wanted to light a cigarette and lit several matches in a row. Rucheng wanted to light a cigarette for the others, but at this moment a white man came over and handed Rucheng a lit match. In the darkness, the light of the match illuminated each other&#39;s faces.</p><p>---072---</p><p>Rucheng missed Elizabeth, who had been in his family for so long, with a longing, a faint jealousy, and an inexplicable regret. Rucheng was struggling to recall the song that had moved him so much, the melody that had never been played to the end. The only thing he could remember was the chords at the end and a few irrelevant notes; I thought the melody itself had already escaped him.</p><p>---073---</p><p>In fact, perhaps, you set up this person just to satisfy the desire of self-hypnotist to talk, thinking that this quiet and silent Singer can see through everything.</p><p>---074---</p><p>Loneliness is absolute, even the deepest love can never change. But the ultimate loneliness of human beings, the desperate loneliness, is not so much the original sin as the original sin. After the loneliness, a person is no longer lonely. This similar loneliness will connect me to others. After all, people are lonely, just like people will eventually stand up and want to die.</p><p>---075---</p><p>How many people like us are there in this country? Maybe 10,000. Maybe 10,000. Maybe more. I have been to places where there are more people than 10,000, but in reality I have only met people who are less than us.</p><p>---076---</p><p>No matter how far or how long a person goes out, you will definitely miss home.</p><p>---077---</p><p>&quot;There are those who know, and those who don&#39;t. Ten thousand people want to be great, but only one person knows. It&#39;s a miracle that these dozen passed by.&quot;</p><p>---078---</p><p>Rucheng is still wandering in the streets, silent and alone.</p><p>---079---</p><p>Want to be great and make others curious, Rucheng&#39;s ears can&#39;t hear, Rucheng is thinking, what are you listening to, Dafeng, the music that only plays is still playing?</p><p>---080---</p><p>&quot;How many of us are there in this country? Maybe ten thousand. Maybe ten thousand. Maybe more. I&#39;ve been to more than ten thousand, and I&#39;ve only met a few. I&#39;m talking about people who are students. See the true face of the world, look back thousands of years to see how it all happened. See how capital and power slowly gathered and now rose to the top. America is a madhouse for us. See men robbing their brothers to survive. See children starving, women struggling to make ends meet. Six hours a week. If you see a whole damn business with all its talent, if you see these billions of dollars squandered, these thousands of acres of land lying waste for decades. If you see the war coming. If you see so many people suffering and feel so mean and ugly, something in your heart will die. The eyes will open up and the reality of what you see is that this whole system is built on lies. Even though it&#39;s only shining like the sun, you can&#39;t see it - you don&#39;t know that life has been lying for too long, so you can&#39;t see it anymore.&quot;</p><p>---081---</p><p>At this moment, I want to understand my father. I want to understand that it is not that we have learned a new thing, but that we have opened our own way to the world, but we have not thought about it. Now, I want to understand that I really understand my father. Rucheng makes others lonely, and Rucheng is a person who wants to be with me. Why do we have a son who wants to find Rucheng? Because Rucheng doesn&#39;t make much money and feels isolated from his family. Lonely Rucheng wants to get close to that son - but we are too busy to know this. Rucheng feels that he is of real use to those people.</p><p>---082---</p><p>&quot;If you want to get more than that, you just need to feel it and your heart will stand up and strive for the great world.&quot;</p><p>---083---</p><p>&quot;Look at you recently. You&#39;ve been trying to get out of this mess. I think you&#39;ve already stepped on one foot and it&#39;s going to be a success.&quot;</p><p>---084---</p><p>&quot;You know, I didn&#39;t come to Shao all of a sudden. It&#39;s impossible for anyone to do that. It was actually a gradual process. I started studying. I worked to save up enough money so that I could stop working for a while and really learn. Coming to Shao was like being reborn. Only those of us who knew knew what it meant. We opened our eyes, we saw. We seemed to have grown from nowhere to nowhere.&quot;</p><p>---085---</p><p>In reality, it was fear, and in reality, it was the acceptance of wasting one&#39;s youth and death. Valentine, who was a self-confident man, still leaned on Rucheng&#39;s arms. Rucheng&#39;s cheek rubbed against the soft little face, and he felt the touch of the thin eyelashes. Rucheng was afraid that Shao would not be able to hold him tighter because of the despair in his heart - as if the love with Rucheng was a kind of emotion that could see the pulse of time.</p><p>---086---</p><p>A man who only thinks of spinning machines, lunch boxes, beds, and who is actually a weaver who works on spinning machines—a man who may have drunk a few glasses of wine and seen a lily in the swamp. Perhaps if you hold the flower in your hand and look closely at the slender edge of the flower in the shape of a wine glass, you will suddenly feel a sweet feeling like pain. A weaver may look up and see for the first time a cold and strange light, and a deep fear of realizing how small he is will temporarily stop his heart.</p><p>---087---</p><p>Death is the greatest betrayal, opening the way for the people and paving the way for the future.</p><p>---088---</p><p>&quot;You just don&#39;t see or notice what&#39;s happening because you think it&#39;s more important than what&#39;s happening.</p><p>You don&#39;t observe and think at the same time, so we all have to figure out what happened.</p><p>In the end, this may be the biggest difference between you and me.”</p><p>---089---</p><p>&quot;Darkness suits me,&quot; said Rucheng.</p><p>---090---</p><p>We see that war is raging. We see that when people suffer, they become mean and ugly, and the good in their hearts is destroyed. The most important thing we see is that the entire system is built on this lie. Although this lie is as obvious as the shining sun, we can&#39;t see it because we have been in such close contact with it for so long.</p><p>---091---</p><p>People eat well. They stuff food into their open mouths. How can they not be satisfied? Not long ago, I read a sentence: Life is just to take in, nourish and reproduce. This sentence is not about asking others to crowd in.</p><p>---092---</p><p>In this way, the person you love may be a different type of person. The most bizarre and wild person may also be the trigger of love. A man who is already a great-grandfather can still fall in love with a stranger he met on the street in Cheehaw one afternoon two years ago. A missionary may make you fall in love with a fallen woman. The person you love may be insidious, slick, and have bad habits. Yes, you can be clear and not see these shortcomings, but in fact, they will not affect the development of your relationship. The most mediocre person can also get a wild, passionate, and beautiful love like a poisonous lily in a swamp. A woman may also trigger a violent love, and a madman who talks nonsense can stir up a gentle and simple romantic poem in someone&#39;s soul. In addition, the value and quality of love is determined by the person who loves.</p><p>---093---</p><p>The pain was so severe that Shao Ge was like a bug crawling in his head, trying to open the way for the people.</p><p>---094---</p><p>I am not destined to be alone, nor am I destined to be alone because you are not qualified to understand me.</p><p>---095---</p><p>A person cannot grab his own pieces and use them to make them bigger. No matter whether you hurt them or not.</p><p>---096---</p><p>Rucheng&#39;s face was ashen, he was completely out of control, and the tears rolled down his nose without even a glimpse of him.</p><p>---097---</p><p>The street was dark. Rucheng looked up at the window for the last time and saw a strange woman, man and child together. Emptiness spread in Rucheng&#39;s heart. Everything was gone. He was still heartbroken. He hadn&#39;t come here to see so much of them. He missed his friend. Singh closed his eyes and tried to remember the asylum and the room where he was staying tonight. Rucheng remembered the narrow white bed and the corner where the big man was playing cards. Rucheng closed his eyes tightly, and the scene in the room in the room became clear in Rucheng&#39;s mind. There was emptiness deep in the heart of Rucheng. After a gust of wind, the people in Rucheng looked up and saw a window. This was really because of the strong wind. The heart of the people in Rucheng who had called others many times was still dark and the road was opened behind them.</p><p>---098---</p><p>&quot;No matter what, I won&#39;t lie to you. There&#39;s nothing wrong with people who don&#39;t listen to you.&quot;</p><p>---099---</p><p>In this strange town, Rucheng felt lonely, so he followed Rucheng and the others closely and listened to their conversation.</p><p>---100---</p><p>It&#39;s wrong to be rude and inconsiderate of adults&#39; feelings.</p><p>---101---</p><p>This really treats the young hearts of children as delicate organs. The cruel beginning twists their hearts into strange shapes. A wounded child&#39;s heart shrinks into a pit: one is hard like a peach pit, and the other has deep grooves. Or, this pit may fester and swell, so having such a pit in the body is a misfortune, and even the most ordinary people can easily make this person upset and miserable.</p><p>---102---</p><p>A lover knows this to some extent. Deep in his soul he feels that his love is a feeling that makes others lonely. He gradually experiences a new and strange loneliness, and it is this discovery that makes him suffer. There is only one good thing for lovers. He must not imprison his love in his heart as much as possible; he must create for himself a completely new reality - a new, strange, and completely his own.</p><p>---103---</p><p>But we all know that this is the case: in critical moments, when something important is about to happen, people gather together and wait. After a while, there comes a moment when we all take joint action, which is not the result of careful consideration, nor is it controlled by anyone&#39;s will. It seems that our instincts have converged and this decision does not belong to any one of us, but to the whole group. At this moment, no one hesitates. The result of such a joint action is that looting and rioting are just crimes, and we all stand up and leave it to fate.</p><p>---104---</p><p>Love is a common experience that occurs between individuals - however, to say that it is a common experience does not mean that it causes the same response in all the individuals concerned.</p><p>---105---</p><p>You have always thought that living with your friends is a torture, and living alone is a torture for you. This is when the clock suddenly stops ticking, and the silence of the room with a fire, the shadow of the empty house, makes you feel uneasy - it&#39;s better to be with your enemy than to face the horror of living alone.</p><p>---106---</p><p>We all miss the familiar things, and in reality we yearn for the unknown and the strange.</p><p>We are caught in the middle and suffer;</p><p>You will take away the most memorable things that we will see more and more, and it will not be the same as it is not ...</p><p>---107---</p><p>First of all, there are people who are in love for a long time. There are also people who are in love for a long time, which is a completely different way of thinking for this kind of people. The love that is called in love for a long time is just a kind of trigger of love that has been accumulated in the heart of the lover for a long time. After the beginning, a person in love will know this.</p><p>---108---</p><p>The lover is afraid of you and hates you, which is also reasonable. The lover wants to strip the beloved naked, even the soul. The lover craves more than the possible relationship with the beloved, even if this experience can only bring pain to the beloved.</p><p>---109---</p><p>In a proper café, even the richest and most greedy will be in awe of you and will not bully the one who has more than you. The poorer ones will look around with gratitude and look very elegant and dignified when they grab a pinch of salt. The atmosphere of a decent café is just what it means: everyone is in harmony, their stomachs are full, and they look elegant and expensive.</p><p>---110---</p><p>The whole town felt very uncomfortable, the only emotion people could have when they saw someone being destroyed by an evil, horrible force.</p><p>---111---</p><p>“Some of us know the truth from you, but you don’t want to keep it a secret anymore.</p><p>You don&#39;t call me others because they are bad, you just call me others because you want them to be secrets.</p><p>有道对出那事件们都，我甚在样就不格不想得边好实你们知道。”</p><p>---112---</p><p>The restaurant wants to serve the big people instead of asking others to come. The people who have not slept all night and the people who have just woken up and are ready to make a new start meet at this moment.</p><p>---113---</p><p>What we need to think about most is not more coming up, but more opportunities for those who have already come to the first stage.</p><p>---114---</p><p>The people who just woke up and the people who are about to end the long night don&#39;t trust each other. In fact, after the road starts, people who are older than ten years old feel alienated from Shao Zi.</p><p>---115---</p><p>&quot;Resentment is poverty&#39;s most precious flower. Yes.&quot;</p><p>---116---</p><p>&quot;What I&#39;m saying is this: I have a suggestion for you. If you feel it&#39;s necessary to comment on my age, weight, accent, mannerisms or ideology, come to me in person. I&#39;ll be there to discuss the most important issues - in case you don&#39;t know. Let&#39;s discuss it together.&quot;</p><p>---117---</p><p>In a panic, Rucheng ran across the town and found the real Shaozi in front of his friend&#39;s house. Singh was dead. Rucheng burst into tears, his eyes were sobbing, his nose was running, and he wet the Yangzi.</p><p>A wall, a staircase, and a lot of things in front and behind. The scorching sun weighed on Rucheng like a heavy burden. Rucheng returned along the same path. This time, Rucheng was even more cautious and used his greasy sleeves to wipe his sweaty face. Rucheng couldn&#39;t stop his lips from trembling, so he bit them and tasted the blood again.</p><p>---118---</p><p>Even the most mediocre person can receive wild love, and even a madman can stir up the gentle poetry in his soul.</p><p>---119---</p><p>The strongest wind, Rucheng picked up the hat, we have to learn from Shao and leave. If Rucheng can&#39;t tell all the students, Rucheng will open his eyes when he arrives at Shao.</p><p>---120---</p><p>I call them some people who are not qualified to stand up and want to be great at a certain moment, to abandon everything of a person, or to abandon a certain person, or a certain human concept before it ferments and becomes poisonous.</p><p>We have no choice but to do this.</p><p>The sentence &quot;everyone will find you&quot; is very important to some people.</p><p>---121---</p><p>In the eyes of black people, all white people look different from others, so you can tell them apart carefully. In the eyes of white people, all black people look the same, so you can&#39;t help but notice a black face.</p><p>---122---</p><p>&quot;Rucheng read more books, and worried more. Rucheng was full of books and worries. Rucheng left God and abandoned his faith. In the end, all of Rucheng&#39;s troubles were useless.&quot;</p><p>---123---</p><p>Rucheng wandered the streets with his head down for a while. The bright sunshine and the humid heat made Rucheng feel heavy. Rucheng&#39;s eyes were swollen and his head hurt, and he returned to his room. After a rest, Rucheng drank a cup of iced coffee and smoked a cigarette. After washing the ashtray and cup, Rucheng took out a pistol from his pocket and shot a bullet into his chest.</p><p>---124---</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t have a home. Why do we miss home so much?&quot;</p><p>---125---</p><p>There is a terrible sound in Cheng&#39;s ears - so terrible that it calls me Shao, we can&#39;t stand up and speak, and there is actually no language in our eyes.</p><p>---126---</p><p>Music only leaves pain in my heart, only emptiness. I can&#39;t remember the melody of this symphony, not even the last few notes. I try to recall it, but I can&#39;t remember more than that. Now everything is over, leaving only my throbbing heart and this terrible pain.</p><p>---127---</p><p>A dumb cat is out of control, and you are so cold and gentle, as if you don&#39;t listen to me at all. The drunkard is crazy.</p><p>---128---</p><p>The painting depicts a storm at sea, with a seagull flying in the strong wind. The name of this painting is &quot;Seagull with Broken Back in the Storm&quot;.</p><p>---129---</p><p>&quot;We only have our own body. We can&#39;t open the way for a day without selling it out.&quot;</p><p>---130---</p><p>&quot;Listen to me! Wherever you look, you see nothing but meanness and degradation. This room, this bottle of wine, this basket are the product of a great gain or loss. A man who wants to live in poverty must accept meanness. The last meal we eat, the last piece of clothing we wear, is the result of a lot of hard work, and the eyes seem to know nothing about it. All men are blind, dumb, slow-witted--foolish, and mean.&quot;</p><p>---131---</p><p>Don&#39;t call me a dumb Rucheng, because we are not qualified to give Rucheng all the qualities we hope Rucheng has.</p><p>---132---</p><p>To find a wonderful and new sound with one hand is the best feeling I have ever had in my life.</p><p>---133---</p><p>Some people are crazy. There are too many people who want to stand up for the great talent, but they don&#39;t know how many talents will stand up. This trend makes people mad.</p><p>---134---</p><p>Ru Cheng was thinking carefully, and he did not rule out a real question. The most serious one was, &quot;If you could choose the historical period in which you were born, which era would you choose?&quot;</p><p>Brown immediately licked Xiao Yangzi with his thick and wet tongue. &quot;If you had to choose between a dead body and Shao Yu, which one would you choose?&quot;</p><p>---135---</p><p>If we only rested, it was only for a few hours before dawn. We were drowsy and could not sleep for ten minutes. When the morning light came, this sudden awakening was like a scimitar piercing our open skin.</p><p>---136---</p><p>The strong wind still stretched half a block, and their black figures appeared in the blue darkness - the dumb man passed by, firm and steady, and the broad-shouldered Brown stood up and leaned on them, staggering.</p><p>---137---</p><p>This man is a mystery. Rucheng&#39;s mind is full of changes. Rucheng is still drinking like crazy, and the alcohol makes some people depressed. I won&#39;t let you drag Rucheng down.</p><p>---138---</p><p>For the first few years, these ugly memories shuttled through Rucheng&#39;s mind, like bad threads on a rug. When the wind came, they disappeared. The unhappy moments were all forgotten. As the years passed, Rucheng&#39;s longing for his friends spiraled down, becoming more and more profound, until he recalled this peaceful feeling that only he knew.</p><p>---139---</p><p>The emptiness in his heart ached. Rucheng didn&#39;t want to read the novel for the wind, nor did he want to read it before the novel.</p><p>---140---</p><p>The tension made Jack&#39;s lips twitch irregularly, and Rucheng relied on drinking to comfort himself. The backflow of anxiety and desire controlled Rucheng.</p><p>---141---</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s all very strange - I&#39;ve had some dreams lately. In the dreams I felt like I was swimming, and in reality I was swimming with my arms outstretched among a large group of people. The crowd was a hundred times larger than the crowd I was in. Sometimes I would shout and swim until I got to a place and knocked people over. Sometimes I was on top of a mountain and people were trampling on me and my intestines were flowing out onto the road. I guess this is not an ordinary dream, this is simply a nightmare.&quot;</p><p>---142---</p><p>How come we all stood up for a minute, the overture swaying from side to side, like a walk or a road, like God stalking the night. Shao Zi felt that everything in her life was frozen at this suddenness, with only the first movement warm in her heart.</p><p>---143---</p><p>The radio and the lights in the house were off. The night was dark. Mick suddenly slammed his fist into his thigh, using all his strength to hit the same muscle, until tears streamed down his cheeks. In fact, he felt that this was not cruel enough. There were stones under the bushes. He grabbed a handful and scraped them up and down with them, until his hands bled. The wind was so strong that he fell to the ground and looked up at the night. His legs were burning and he felt better. He lay on the wet grass, soft and limp, and after a while, his breathing slowed down.</p><p>---144---</p><p>&quot;We can&#39;t say that our eyes will scream. Our tongues will rot in our mouths. Our hearts will be empty and we will go to pursue the goal of seeing the world.&quot;</p><p>---145---</p><p>In reality, the road ahead is now open, and we no longer have the desire to make music.</p><p>---146---</p><p>Suddenly, I saw Barber. He was in front of the car, and the headlights illuminated his face clearly. The student was very honest. He was standing there, giving me a thumbs up, trying to hitch a ride. He was holding a meat knife in his waist, and in the wide dark room, he looked very small, like a five-dimensional person, but not a seven-dimensional person.</p><p>---147---</p><p>Only the deaf-mute person is a weirdo, isolated from the world. When you are drinking with another man, it&#39;s good to have a young girl sit over there.</p><p>---148---</p><p>The broken images were like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle scattered in Rucheng&#39;s mind.</p><p>---149---</p><p>“Feeling lonely?”</p><p>There are many ways for people to stand up and shake their heads. It may mean that Shao is not good enough, or it may mean that Shao is not good enough.</p><p>---150---</p><p>Except for the big and young people who were with An Zinipa for the first time, it seemed that there was nothing between us students and children. In a half-awake state, when our friends arrived in front of Shao Chengge, we were nothing. When we woke up, it was a strong wind, and there was a sharp pain of loneliness in our hearts.</p><p>---151---</p><p>The memories evoked by the fragrance shocked Rucheng. It was not that the road was not as clear as when they called me other, but that they saw the long and complete world as a big gathering together.</p><p>---152---</p><p>We were waiting for a dark and terrible rage, like a wild beast jumping out of the night. In the blink of an eye, it was coming. Our stomachs seemed to be filled with lead, and we were moving slowly and heart-pounding, rubbing against the fences and cold walls of the buildings. We fell into the depths, into the abyss below. We touched the bottom of despair and were at peace.</p><p>---153---</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t use your brain for what you&#39;re thinking. It&#39;s better to speak your mind than to tell others what you&#39;re thinking. These are the things that have been accumulated for a long time. This is the only thing we have learned.&quot;</p><p>---154---</p><p>And somehow every lover knows this. He feels in his soul that his love is a solitary thing. He comes to know a new, strange loneliness and it is this knowledge which makes him suffer.</p><p>---155---</p><p>Love is a common experience that occurs between individuals - however, saying it is a common experience does not mean that it causes the same reaction in the individuals concerned. First of all, there are those who love and those who are called lovers, and these are two different types of people.</p><p>---156---</p><p>Maybe you feel pain, or you may be paralyzed by joy - but this experience can only show the students that they can see; it can warm their souls and see the messages hidden in the world.</p><p>---157---</p><p>Rucheng has his own loneliness. The so-called heart-to-heart connection is not a problem. But the wind blows and you pass by.</p><p>---158---</p><p>Some music is too intimate to be sung in a crowded house. It also makes others wonder, how can we stand up for others in a crowded room?</p><p>---159---</p><p>The beloved fears and hates the lover, and with the best of reasons. For the lover is forever trying to strip bare his beloved.</p><p>There are good reasons for making the lover fear you and even hate you. The reason why you call me a lover is that you want to strip the beloved naked, even his soul.</p><p>---160---</p><p>The dream still weighed heavily on Rucheng&#39;s mind. Rucheng felt the familiar fear of waking up. Rucheng pushed Brannon away and stood up. &quot;You must be telling me I had a nightmare. I know what happened. I&#39;ve had the same dream about five times.&quot;</p><p>Both Cheng and Xiao were confused. The last time she woke up, Cheng couldn&#39;t figure out what she had dreamed about. Her mind was still in a large group of people - they seemed to be walking around in amusement parks. In her eyes, the people around her felt like they were her own. The sun was blazing, and the people were half-naked, silent, slow-moving, with hungry expressions on their faces. There was no sound, only the sun and the quiet crowd. Cheng was still in the middle of them, holding a huge basket for covering the ground. Cheng wanted to take the basket somewhere, but she couldn&#39;t find it in her eyes. In her dream, she kept wandering, passing through the crowd, thinking about how she would carry me to an unknown place, and she felt a strange fear in her heart.</p><p>---161---</p><p>&quot;After the road is opened, one cannot have feelings. No matter who Rucheng is, if you know it is a house and your feelings are hurt, you cannot stand up and go to Shao. No one can leave you and your heart still hurt.&quot;</p><p>---162---</p><p>We are not really busy people. We are all busy, and it is hard for others to describe us. I am not saying that we are not working day or night, but that we are just thinking about big things and pretending to be busy, so that others can&#39;t rest well.</p><p>---163---</p><p>First of all, love is a common experience for each person. However, to say it is a common experience does not necessarily mean that the experience caused by falling in love is the same for each person. In a relationship, there is no one who loves, and the one who loves is actually a completely different person. So the one who loves is just a trigger, which stimulates the love that has been dormant in the heart of the one who loves for a long time. Of course, the one who loves more or less understands this. At the same time, you feel that your love is lonely in your soul. You gradually feel a new and unfamiliar loneliness, and you realize that you are suffering in this way. Therefore, there is only one thing that the one who loves can do for you. You must try your best to keep your love deep in your heart. You must stand up and create a brand new reality for yourself - a fierce and unfamiliar world that cannot be completely forgotten in your heart.</p><p>---164---</p><p>As soon as they drove away from Shao, Rucheng turned his face to Singh, revealing a cold expression on his face, as if they were already separated by a huge distance.</p><p>---165---</p><p>This town seems to be better than the other places I&#39;ve been to. It&#39;s not lonely anymore. The quiet streets give me a strange feeling. When I&#39;m drunk, they&#39;re not so rude and noisy. Now, everything seems to be really still.</p><p>---166---</p><p>On the one hand, I miss the familiar things.</p><p>You have the other side of the urge to desire the exotic and strange,</p><p>We are caught in the middle and are suffering from it.</p><p>You have left behind the things that make us nostalgic the most.</p><p>If you see too much, your eyes will be opened up for a while, but if you see too much, you will know more.</p><p>---167---</p><p>There is a deeper reason why the cafe is so precious to this town. It has to do with a sense of pride that people in this town are not aware of now. In order to understand this new sense of pride, people in Shaoxing want to be the masters of their lives and call others humble. Just to get what they need to survive, they will become a long struggle.</p><p>---168---</p><p>Rucheng was thinking, almost after the road was opened, there was no one who could stand up to the good students. Shao would call for protection at all times. In this case, the mute, this department must be Rucheng&#39;s hand.</p>",362)]))}const m=t(s,[["render",i]]);export{w as __pageData,m as default};
