famous song he played li chuanyuns chinese name is the following below is information gathered from another site httpenglishcricn44062007061447238578htmif china wants to have a great violinist they have one all they have to do is look after him commented master violinist ruggiero ricci after a performance by li chuanyun in 2004this boy should make a good career hes got good breed hes intuitive hes temperament he has a lot of temperament its strong and temperament is very important so hes got all the requisitesli chuanyun is widely recognized as the youngest professional violinist in the

early at five he won his first championship at the beijing youth and junior violin competition at eleven he received the top award at the fifth wieniawski international youth violin competition becoming the youngest winner in the competitions historybut it is not awards that stir lis passion his motivation is musicthe relationship between me and violin is that of soulmates its a kind of spiritual support something like that almost everyone agree that he is talented professor lin yaoji from the central conservatory of music the most prestigious music education center in china recalls the first time he listened to sixyearold li chuanyuni didnt take it seriously at first a sixyearold playing lalo i just dismissed it but once the boy started playing i saw huge talent i was amazedin

people he felt that way he said we just wait and seechuanyun has been labelled by some as crazed and unbridled because of often eclectic and spontaneous style however qiu xingye thinks its a misunderstandingchuan yun is very lovely and sensitive he cant hurt any people even an animal some people always say he is crazy i think they misunderstand him actually he is very sensitive for example if he saw a beggar or somebody who cant walk he feels sad he thinks what if hes like that how would he feel he thinks a lot and then it becomes depression thats his problem actually he cares about people he wants to feel about these people why they are sad and then he feels sad himselfthen what does the young violinist think about his dynamic and expressive range and spontaneous outbreakcontrol myself more that will be good i mean i always put too much energy anger maybe power into it i can play like more mild more gentle i think i have that kind of ability but it depends whether i want to do it or notwhile other musical prodigies like violinist ning feng pianist li yundi or lang lang have gained fame in the international arena li chuanyun has lagged behind with his

struggling tanzanian economy and the rise of hip hop nationalism served as a broader socioeconomic backdrop for the group expansion of what mc rhymson termed the kiswacentric concept rhymsons efforts to create this hip hop nation coined kwanzania is one of his largest contributions to tanzanias hip hop scene as he tried to create a hypothetical community whose cementing force is hip hop creating this hypothetical yet important space for hip hop in tanzania was a way to unite rappers to lyrically express their culture values and goals and overall way of life rhymson along with the other

an old mentality of rising a country from a colonial state into an independent country called ujamaa by developing this sort of community rhymson showed an authentic quality that was far more profound than just the expression of hip hop through the swahili language kwanzania developed into a vanguard against the cultural imperialism of american hip hop as africans looked past the romanticized

raj bhattarai is a heartrending tale of illiterate and naive nepalese youths who are tricked to work as bondage laborers in bhutan while in search of better future in indiait is a saga of sorrow owing to lack of education and consciousness there is cruelty of the heartless and extreme of exploitation the major theme is the dictatorship of the state and discrimination suffered by the immigrant nepalese thule and satar the major characters represent thousands of poor innocent and illiterate nepali youths who flee their homes every year with the dream of better quality of life but their dreams get shattered in the hands of frauds and tyrants in the alien land various well known authors and critics like parijat and michael hutt have spent words to praise the magic the twenty one year old author cast on the audience in those days and even nowfor parijat mugln is the second novel i have read in a single breath within a decade unless the language style presentation is good it becomes difficult to read any literature muglan however is criticized for being too pessimistic in tone and exaggerating the then existing circumstances muglan has been rendered into english from nepali by lekhnath sharma pathaksocrates footsteps is the english translation of govinda raj bhattarais masterpiece sukaratka paila into english socrates footsteps is a major representation of war literature from nepal it is set against the time when nepal was undergoing the most devastating war led by maoists the novel reveals how war creates mere destruction and division not merely of physical kind but also of psychological and spiritual socrates a historical character represents here a university professor and ananta the central character represents nepalese youth who becomes the victim of war the novel is immensely philosophical and attempts to raise several metaphysical questions on life death truth etc the novel exploits history as fiction and appears to revolve around the theme of war terror suicide romance and academia at surface level however at deeper level bhattarai takes the readers even higher to contemplate on the question of life and death and consciousness this novel is as infamous as famous again for dealing with the issue of suicide the novel has been translated from nepali into english by bal ram adhikarisocrates diary is govinda raj bhattarais sequel to his previous fiction socrates footsteps socrates diary is a fiction about fiction and therefore technically a better label would be metafiction or a poimenon bhattarai has used a number of postmodern devices to give his thought a concrete shape such as pastiche intertexuality authorial intrusion historiographic metafiction technoculture hyperreality magical realism farce melodrama etc at surface level socrates diary appears to be a narrative of a university professor instructing his student the principles and practices of fiction writing but at deeper level it turns out to be mere play of signs farcical socrates represents fictional professor sharma of nepal who is very conventional and sticks to the realist tradition which ultimately fails to bring about the author inside ananata the major character of the novel coleridges dictum there is no great art without strangeness proves true to this artistic unlike other novels socrates diary puzzles the readers with travelogue poetry dialogue diary exercises references appendices interviews online conversations and its reviews within the novel bhattarai has shown his creative altitude with a stylistically most complicated creation so far it is not without criticism either socrates diary is perceived as too complex a work which is of course beyond the reach of ordinary readers the novel is being translated into

pakistaniborn player who emigrated to canada in the late1960s and who retired shortly before talbott emerged on the scenethe most significant factor that counts against talbotts claim to being the greatest hardball squash player of alltime is his record against sharifs distant cousin jahangir khan in the mid1980s talbott had begun to establish himself as the most dominant player in the hardball squash game while jahangir was the clear leading player on the international softball squash circuit during 198386 jahangir decided to test his ability on the north american hardball circuit talbott

the challenge from jahangir talbott acquired a personal coach ken binns who helped him develop a much sharper array of shots as the rivalry developed their matches became very competitive and drew considerable attention after 1986 jahangir stopped playing on the hardball circuit to focus more on the softball game whether talbott would have been able to turn the tide had the rivalry continued
