twentythree were diagnosed with fiithe project attracted controversy for its methods and for the ethical implications of the research critics argued that the desire of the researchers to observe the carers harming the children exposed the children to further abuse that the betrayal of doctorpatient trust necessarily involved in the surveillance could cause harm to the subjects and that a diagnosis should lead to treatment not punishment however the researchers argued that the surveillance saved the lives of many of the children involved and southall himself said that by doing covert video surveillance we are betraying the trust of parents but if a parent has been abusing his or her child in this way then the trust between child and parent has already gonein the early 1990s southall led a study which pioneered continuous negative extrathoracic pressure therapy a treatment for breathing difficulties in young children involving the application of negative pressure to the patients chests the study was controversial with some parents of the children involved suggesting that the treatment was linked to subsequent death or brain injury the research was the subject of

psychological outcomes from the use of the techniquein 1993 during the bosnian war southall traveled to sarajevo as a participant in a medical evacuation programme for sick children from the area prompted by his experiences there of what he described as trauma inflicted on children and their families not only by warring factions but also by the indolence of the international community southall established child advocacy international on his return to advocate for international child health issuesin 2004 southall was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the general medical council gmc after alleging to police that the husband of sally clark was responsible for murdering the couples children southall made the claim to child protection officers of the staffordshire police after watching a television documentary about the case the gmc banned southall from child protection work for three years the council for healthcare regulatory excellence challenged the decision as insufficient and argued that he should be deregistered but a high court of justice decision in 2005 held that the sanction was not unduly lenientin february 2007 attorneygeneral lord goldsmith announced that a review would be held into a number of criminal cases in which southall gave evidence for the prosecution following allegations that southall kept up to 4450 personal case files on child patients which were kept separate from the official hospital recordson 4 december 2007 southall was struck off the medical register after being found guilty of professional misconduct by the general medical council southall appealed this decision in the high court but the appeal was dismissed in his judgement mr justice blake stated that southall had speculated on nonmedical matters in an offensive manner entirely inconsistent with the status of an independent experton 1 june 2009 dr southall was the subject of an episode of the bbcs current affairs program panorama title a very
