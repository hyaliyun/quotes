an irishborn australian psychiatrist known for his development of the early intervention services for youthmcgorry is professor of youth mental health at the university of melbourne he has written numerous peer reviewed articles published in journals including the lancet the british journal of psychiatry the american journal of psychiatry and the medical journal of australia he is executive director of orygen the national centre of excellence in youth mental health and founding editor of early intervention in psychiatry published by the international early psychosis association mcgorry also advocated strongly for the establishment of the australian government funded national youth mental health foundation which became headspace and is a founding board member of that organisationmcgorry and his colleagues developed an approach for young people who have symptoms of psychosis for the first time based at the eppic clinic in melbourne this eppic clinic has played a key part in an early psychosis treatment paradigm for psychiatry and has led to significant reform of mental health services especially in the united kingdom the eppic clinic is best represented by the catch phrase a stitch in time and its development of a service for those at risk of developing psychosis initial evaluations of eppic showed that it was not only effective compared to the previous traditional model of care but that it was also cost effective some critics have recently disputed these findings in the past two decades more rigorous randomised evaluations in england and denmark have shown that early intervention is effective over the first two years of care at least but when patients return to traditional care some of the gains are lost canadian data indicates that if patients remain in early intervention services for five years the gains are sustained one critic has alleged that mcgorry has systematically misled the australian government about the nature and implications of his evaluation study on eppic by misstating the description of the control group while more rigorous evaluations of early intervention services have been carried out in other countries a systematic review of these studies concluded there is some support for specialised early intervention services but further trials would be desirable and there is a question of whether gains are maintained mcgorry has claimed that early intervention services can save money but this has also been questioned by a recent review of the evidence professor mcgorry was awarded the centenary medal in 2003 in recognition of his work on the eppic programmemcgorry has advocated for early intervention with young people who are at risk of psychosis but who are not currently psychotic including the use of antipsychotic medication his views have been criticised by a number of people including allen frances the chair of the dsmiv taskforce on the basis that most atrisk young people will not become psychotic and preemptive treatment may be risky mcgorry and his colleagues have responded to this criticism arguing that critics have blurred the key distinction between clinical recommendations and ethically approved research designed to build evidence to more firmly guide clinical practice a trial of the antipsychotic medication quetiapine led by mcgorry attracted criticism on ethical grounds and was discontinued more recently mcgorry has begun investigating the use of lower risk treatments such as fish oilmcgorry has advocated to the australian government to create a national network of early psychosis intervention centres based on claims that early treatment may improve longterm outcomes some critics have argued that he has exaggerated the evidence for early intervention and that longterm benefits and economic savings have not been established he has been accused of having a conflict of interest in using his position on a government advisory committee to advocate for programs that he founded mcgorry has denied that he has any conflict of interest and a spokesperson for the australian government stated that professor mcgorry was just one member of the mental health expert working group which was made up of experts from a range of health and nonhealth sectors plus consumer and carer representatives and while these consultations helped to inform the development of the

later became interested in existential issues and family therapy he worked for a time with fritz perls and there is much overlap in their orientations kempler calls his form of treatment variously experiential or gestalt family therapy his focus is on the immediate on feelings and desires that lie behind verbal and nonverbal messages and on their clear and complete deliveryfull engagement of family members is his immediate goal which in turn supports his overall goal the experience of life its ongoing flow of union and separationneither separateness nor union is the goal of the therapeutic process but rather the exhortation of the endless and often painful undulation between thema family is made up of members who need and seek both union and separation from each other the task of the therapist is to reconcile emerging and often conflicting personal desires to arouse remind forgotten desires to fire up abandoned conflict and to keep all combatants at the front until everybody wins winning of course does not mean that everybody is satisfied with the result but rather the resulting satisfaction compromise or loss is fully felt with no residuals for example if someone must give up a cherished fantasy about their relationship this loss must not only be realized but experienced and fully grievedexperience is essential for kempler he sees his approach as oriented to an exploration of the resistances to experience he is quite clear in asserting that experience action is the key to producing change the therapist can lead or push people toward experience but wherever possible must not usurp the experiencing but let the momentum created carry the participants into the intimate experience of each other and their own desires needs and fantasies desire clearly expressed and movingly delivered brings change in its wake sometimes through fulfillment sometimes through the expression alone for kempler change results from confronting and fully experiencing reality in the here and now leading to the acceptance of ones and others continual movement toward and away from union"},{"author":"Richard Dalla-Riva","quote":"richard alex gordon

armando vassallo a leading sculptor of the 20thcentury style the first teacher and close friend of francesco messina was one of the most representative of the close of figurativists who shone by their research potential and originality mostly inspired by the classicism and archaicmodernizing that were supreme in 1930s italy by the time vassallo moved from genoa to novi he had taken part in two venice biennals 1928 and 1930 and the 1925 exposition des arts dcoratifs in paris he had established relationships and worked with major exponents of art and culture from adolfo wildt to arturo martini from edgar wood to rino valdameri giovanni pastrone and gabriele dannunzio on the poster of the major film cabiria by this time vassallo had already begun to express dissent with fascist regime as far as art was concerned and this was to lead to him openly criticising its leaders and his consequent exclusion from the public exhibition circuit vassallos last showing was in september 1933 together with arturo martini with whom he shared the pressing need to italian art and sculpturealmaviva has processed the dramatic events his father lived through into one of the reasons for demystifying artistic officialdom a feature of his entire career19631966almaviva attended francesco messinas studio in brera milan this was when he came into contact with gino ghiringhelli dino buzzati carlo carr and lucio fontana the milano period very soon led almaviva to define his artistic itinerary just as he was subjecting himself to unconditional critical scrutiny as to what he had acquired not only in art but in much broader terms every idea that could provide a global view of the world too the need of selfgenerated research which by definition does not use known languages not even those of the avantgarde movements stemmed from the basic idea of immersing the part of what existed that could be accomplished into the sphere of the biological which is dominated by violence and injustice and compared to which everything that has been acquired in art or by metaphysical projection is elusive or consolatory faced with the drama of existence of dominating the ze the whole contemporary debate on art avantgardism or tradition figurative or abstract and its role seemed secondary to almaviva19671968almaviva delevops tonaltimbrica which provides an original translation of the character of irrepressible biological antagonism its formal structure consists in a reduction to the extreme of the two components that make up the tonal element the colouristic base which identifies the masses in the background and the timbric the weft of pure immediate intractable colour that gives it a particularly aggressive look as though the shapes were reaching outward to the onlooker in milan almaviva exhibits palpito primordiale primordial beat at the rotonda besana and holds his first oneman show at the galleria einarte in corso buenos aires19691970he opens galleria amaltea in genoa a documentation centre for his work there emerges a more pronounced need for autonomy also by means of a dialectic exchange with avantgardism that were appearing in the city19711979 in 1971 filoplastica was born a structure whose form was the channeling off through a sinuous gossamerthin filament which symbiotically enlivens the tonal element of the background of the code that had been honed in tonaltimbrica in an atmosphere of suspension and tenuousness of the mark of the painting the phyloplastic outcome means that the block caused by fruitless witnessing and denunciation seen in the poetics of tonaltimbrica is partly overcome prefigurig globalism which is possible since filoplastica itself has a secular outlook of openness to knowledge which absorbs the very dimension of the biological and leads it to being the manifestation if a crystalline substance indefinitely plastic and tenuous the theoretical definition of filoplastica is continued in genoa fully independently from the dominating artistic currents and the critique which was then considered militant by a series of 50 oneman shows up to now almaviva does not take part in collectives or awardwinning events19792007he continues his workand research in tuscany in his homeatelier in buggiano noting that he is also interested int the cultural promotion of public bodies and museums both in

professor rudolph staffel continuing at the university of wisconsin he studied with british sculptor hubert dalwood graduating in 1968 with an mfa oginz was offered the opportunity by dalwood to teach parttime at hornsey college of art and design in londonduring this time his work focused on the contemporary minimalist school using steel and wood in precise ways trying to achieve an industrial aesthetic oginzs pieces were installations that depicted a continuity of space and scale without the ridgity of the edge or boundary in an exhibition at serpentine gallery in hyde park a rectangular shape was described by its content of random vectors ending at the imaginary plane of the rectangle this piece was a few feet high inside the gallery and got progressively larger as it moved through a glass wall and continued out into hyde park where it ended at a 10 foot height though it embraced the minimalist aesthetic oginzs inspiration came from notions of quantum physicsthat vectors made of wood were describing the scale and shape as opposed to its contours this piece is an example of a turning point in oginzs artistic practicea shift from minimalism to a focus on the philosophy of sciencethe serpentine exhibition lead to a postgraduate fellowship at the university of leeds called the gregory fellowship where his work made another radical changefrom abstract to figurative here oginz found his ideas concerned with scientific thinking needed a more literal expression he retrained himself in traditional sculpture technique in rendering the human figure after 8 years of living in england partly in leeds partly in london oginz came to identify strongly with los angeles a city devoted to individual expression and fantasy the great piece of folk art called the watts towers captivated oginzs imagination and in 1976 he moved to los angeles this is where drawing became central to his practice focusing on depicting the juxtaposition between the innerworkings of his studio and the outerworkings of the city windows became a metaphor for mental imagery contrasted with the external environment this was a comparative study between subjective and objective these early years in los angeles in spite of fulltime teaching were the most successful for oginz with exhibitions and representation in three different commercial galleries and a major award and survery exhibition at

november 2005 was leaked to sue neales chief reporter of the mercury who was later criticised by the chief justice for her contempt of court the agreement was leaked by a disgruntled employee david john diprose a former director of the tcc who had previously been stood down for incompetency and then sacked for dishonesty the agreement was intended to provide for the protection of intellectual property of the tcc and enable the establishment of appropriate contingency arrangements in the event of either party the tcc or the government wishing to withdraw the intention of the sla was to
