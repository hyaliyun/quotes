However, it can be an extremely valuable savings account.</p><p>I think it&#39;s horrible that people have to be told. Don&#39;t smoke! Everybody knows it&#39;s bad for the health. But they have to forbid it.</p><p>There are less than 1 per cent of anorexic girls, but there more than 30 per cent of girls in France - I don&#39;t know about England - that are much, much overweight. And it is much more dangerous and very bad for the health.</p><p>A retired teacher paid $62,000 towards her pension and nothing, yes nothing, for full family medical, dental and vision coverage over her entire career.

Beginning on May 6, we will once again have the opportunity to truly commend the nursing community for their contributions to our national health delivery system.</p><p>Got good news and bad news for you, Mr. President. The good news is that Chief Justice John Roberts just saved your legacy and, perhaps, your presidency by writing for the Supreme Court majority to rule health care reform constitutional.</p><p>For families across the UK who are income-poor, but more than that, whose lives are blighted by worklessness, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt and poor health, as well as other problems, giving them an extra pound - say through increased benefits - will not address the reason they find themselves in difficulty in the first place.</p><p>He whom the gods love dies young, while he is in health, has his senses and his judgments sound.</p><p>We believe in government involvement that leads to independence: good schools, quality roads and the best health care.</p><p>We know a great deal more about the causes of physical disease than we do about the causes of physical health.</p><p>I have never yet met a healthy person who worried very much about his health, or a really good person who worried much about his own soul.</p><p>Well, we lost a lot of our independence already.

What the public is taught is that health is the cure for disease.</p><p>I have had lots of friends who&#39;ve been affected by Aids and a very good friend of mine, Oscar Moore, died of Aids and I was with him in his last year quite a bit. And of course he was a man living in a very rich culture with a wealthy family who was able to afford health care.</p><p>The ultimate purpose of religious life is to make this evolution move in a direction far more important to the destiny of the ego than the moral health of the social fabric which forms his present environment.</p><p>People use so much more health care when they live longer.</p><p>We drink one another&#39;s health and spoil our own.</p><p>There&#39;s a need for accepting responsibility - for a person&#39;s life and making choices that are not just ones for immediate short-term comfort. You need to make an investment, and the investment is in health and education.</p><p>One thing governors feel, Democrats and Republicans alike, is that we have a health care system that, if you&#39;re on Medicaid, you have unlimited access to health care, at unlimited levels, at no cost. No wonder it&#39;s running away.</p><p>My main goal is to stay healthy because when you&#39;re injured you realise how lucky you are to have your health.</p><p>I&#39;m one of those people who is actually inspired by a deadline. I might not sleep for many days on end, it may not be good for my health, but it definitely helps.</p><p>America doesn&#39;t have health insurance.</p><p>If you want to know why Republicans and conservatives are in a political crisis, you need only consider the fact that the Right&#39;s deeply held view now boils down to this: Taxes should not go up on the wealthy, and your health benefits should be cut.</p><p>Obama seemed poised to realign American politics after his stunning 2008 victory. But the economy remains worse than even the administration&#39;s worst-case scenarios, and the long legislative battles over health care reform, financial services reform and the national debt and deficit have taken their toll. Obama no longer looks invincible.</p><p>Health consists of having the same diseases as one&#39;s neighbors.</p><p>In order to lead a country or a company, you&#39;ve got to get everybody on the same page and you&#39;ve got to be able to have a vision of where you&#39;re going. America can&#39;t have a vision of health care for everybody, green economy, regulations - can&#39;t have a bunch of piece-meal activities. It&#39;s got to have a vision.</p><p>If I were a capitalist I would not give my employees health insurance with no deductible, which I do, including dental, and paid pregnancy leave. That&#39;s not called capitalism, that&#39;s called being a Christian and someone who believes in democracy, so that everyone should get a fair slice of the pie.</p><p>Successful health reform must not just make health insurance affordable, affordable health insurance has to make health care affordable.</p><p>People who overly take care of their health are like misers. They hoard up a treasure which they never enjoy.</p><p>People who are always taking care of their health are like misers, who are hoarding a treasure which they have never spirit enough to enjoy.</p><p>Many kids come out of college, they have a credit card and a diploma. They don&#39;t know how to buy a house or a car or health insurance or life insurance. They do not know basic microeconomics.</p><p>Dick Cheney said he was running again.

Health is the most important thing.</p><p>We cannot continue. Our pension costs and health care costs for our employees are going to bankrupt this city.</p><p>What I got which was unusual, especially as a child actress, was parents who believed that Hollywood was not that important. They told us education, family, health, all come first and they meant it.</p><p>The preservation of health is a duty. Few seem conscious that there is such a thing as physical morality.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to be a wreck. You don&#39;t have to be sick. One&#39;s aim in life should be to die in good health. Just like a candle that burns out.</p><p>Obama is capable - as evidenced by his first-term success with health care reform. But mandate-building requires humility, a trait not easily associated with him.</p><p>Republicans would have preferred the court overturn the health care bill, an act that would have underscored Obama&#39;s biggest liability - the perception among voters, including those who like and trust him, that he has been ineffective.</p><p>Restoring responsibility and accountability is essential to the economic and fiscal health of our nation.</p><p>My life in Brooklyn was in constant danger because of my bad health.</p><p>I am opposed to anybody making a decision for you or me or anybody else about what health care plan we should have.</p><p>My Dad is my hero.

But what they&#39;ve lost is the argument that we are a society.</p><p>While Democrats fussed with the details of health care reforms, conservatives spent months telling the nation that the real issue is freedom, that what&#39;s on the line is American liberty itself.</p><p>Government is, by its very nature, a destroyer of liberties the Obama administration, specifically, is promising to interfere with the economy and the health care system so profoundly that Washington will soon have us all in chains.</p><p>What is at stake in the debate over health care is more than the mere crafting of policy. The issue is now the identity of the Democratic Party.</p><p>Mr. Obama still has time to reverse course. A great deal depends on it. To fail on health care yet again might well be the &#39;Waterloo&#39; Republicans dream of.</p><p>Every profession will have its rogues, of course, no matter what oaths are sworn, but many health care professionals have a real commitment to serving the best interests of their clients.</p><p>No matter how old you are, no matter how much you weigh, you can still control the health of your body.</p><p>Effective health care depends on self-care this fact is currently heralded as if it were a discovery.</p><p>The greatest public health threat for many American women is the men they live with.</p><p>As it turns out, social scientists have established only one fact about single women&#39;s mental health: employment improves it.</p><p>It&#39;s easier to lecture women on sexual morality than it is to explain why all Americans shouldn&#39;t have comprehensive, fair, and equal health care coverage.</p><p>Women know the financial, social and physical costs of not having access to basic health care.</p><p>It&#39;s long past time we started focusing on the solutions that actually keep women healthy, instead of using basic aspects of women&#39;s health as a tool of cultural, moral, and political control.</p><p>We should be concerned not only about the health of individual patients, but also the health of our entire society.</p><p>People spending more of their own money on routine health care would make the system more competitive and transparent and restore the confidence between the patients and the doctors without government rationing.</p><p>Health care is one-sixth of our economy. If the government can control that, they can control just about everything. We need to understand what is going on, because there are much more economic models that can be used to give us good health care than what we have now.</p><p>I hope someday we will be able to proclaim that we have banished hunger in the United States, and that we&#39;ve been able to bring nutrition and health to the whole world.</p><p>I&#39;m not into animal rights. I&#39;m only into animal welfare and health. I&#39;ve been with the Morris Animal Foundation since the &#39;70s. We&#39;re a health organization. We fund campaign health studies for dogs, cats, lizards and wildlife. I&#39;ve worked with the L.A. Zoo for about the same length of time. I get my animal fixes!</p><p>As musicians and artists, it&#39;s important we have an environment - and I guess when I say environment, I really mean the industry, that really nurtures these gifts. Oftentimes, the machine can overlook the need to take care of the people who produce the sounds that have a lot to do with the health and well-being of society.</p><p>I think the number one thing Black women and all Black people should be paying attention to is our health.</p><p>Any health care funding plan that is just, equitable, civilized and humane must - must - redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the poorer and the less fortunate. Excellent healthcare is by definition re-distributional.</p><p>I think first and foremost everybody should understand that Canadians are strongly committed to the system of universal health insurance, to the principle that your ability to pay does not determine your access to critical medical service.</p><p>For the sake of our health, our children and grandchildren and even our economic well-being, we must make protecting the planet our top priority.</p><p>Thanks to evolution, our bodies have powerful ways to ward off illness and infection and enable us to live long and healthy lives. Why, then, do health costs continue to climb at unsustainable and frightening rates?</p><p>Hydraulic fracturing requires massive amounts of water. Disposing of the toxic wastewater, as well as accidental spills, can contaminate drinking water and harm human health.</p><p>Doing all we can to combat climate change comes with numerous benefits, from reducing pollution and associated health care costs to strengthening and diversifying the economy by shifting to renewable energy, among other measures.</p><p>The power of community to create health is far greater than any physician, clinic or hospital.</p><p>I was one of those people who put too much emphasis on work and career and material possessions, and it took its toll on all my relationships, on my physical health, my emotional and mental health.</p><p>My health and my family are the core of my being.</p><p>Strong advocacy for education, health care and worker safety will be indispensable if they are to get their fair share of President Bush&#39;s austere budget for the next fiscal year.</p><p>The dual scourge of hunger and malnutrition will be truly vanquished not only when granaries are full, but also when people&#39;s basic health needs are met and women are given their rightful role in societies.</p><p>Yoga is wonderful. It clears up most health problems. It also gives you an overview.</p><p>Do we talk about the dignity of work? Do we give our students any reason for believing it is worthwhile to sacrifice for their work because such sacrifices improve the psychological and mental health of the person who makes them?</p><p>Love is not as important as good health. You cannot be in love if you&#39;re not healthy. You can&#39;t appreciate it.</p><p>It&#39;s funny, I do try to maintain health. I started doing Bikram yoga which is that hothouse yoga, the 105 degrees yoga for 90 minutes. It&#39;s great, you purge out all the sweat and you&#39;re drinking water.</p><p>If Charlton Heston can have a constitutional right carry a rifle, why can&#39;t grandma have a constitutional right to health care?</p><p>My health is very much improved.</p><p>Think of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance.</p><p>Health care reform, the marquee legislative accomplishment of the Obama administration&#39;s first term, was passed before we entered the world of divided government.</p><p>You cannot drive a system that&#39;s going to be aiming at preventing illness if everyone is not in it. The whole gaming of health insurance and health care in America is based on that fundamental principle: insure people who aren&#39;t sick and you don&#39;t have to pay more money on them.</p><p>Experience taught me that working families are often just one pay check away from economic disaster. And it showed me first-hand the importance of every family having access to good health care.</p><p>A woman&#39;s health is her capital.</p><p>I mean, the fight for a health care bill to cover all Americans and leave none behind is attacked as being a race appeal, which is not true, but then it&#39;s put out in the media as true.</p><p>One state retiree, 49 years old, paid, over the course of his entire career, a total of $124,000 towards his retirement pension and health benefits. What will we pay him? $3.3 million in pension payments over his life and nearly $500,000 for health care benefits - a total of $3.8m on a $120,000 investment.</p><p>In today&#39;s world, it is shortsighted to think that infectious diseases cannot cross borders. By allowing developing countries access to generic drugs, we not only help improve health in those nations, we also help ourselves control these debilitating and often deadly diseases.</p><p>With the loss of Free Choice Vouchers, hundreds of thousands of workers will now be forced to choose between their employers&#39; unaffordable insurance or going without health care.</p><p>Since 1994, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have considered it politically risky to offer a plan to fix America&#39;s broken health care system. The American public, though, has paid the price for this silence as health care costs skyrocketed, millions went uninsured, and millions more grappled with financial insecurity and hardship.</p><p>Pay mind to your own life, your own health, and wholeness. A bleeding heart is of no help to anyone if it bleeds to death.</p><p>A comfortable house is a great source of happiness. It ranks immediately after health and a good conscience.</p><p>Wendy Malick and Valerie Bertinelli make fun of me, but I take care of my health - I don&#39;t abuse it.</p><p>The bottom line is, I&#39;m blessed with good health. On top of that, I don&#39;t go around thinking &#39;Oh, I&#39;m 90, I better do this or I better do that.&#39; I&#39;m just Betty. I&#39;m the same Betty that I&#39;ve always been. Take it or leave it.</p><p>I seem to be thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists. However, this is not entirely a matter of joy as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health.</p><p>Competition makes things come out right. Well, what does that mean in health care? More hospitals so they compete with each other. More doctors compete with each other. More pharmaceutical companies. We set up war. Wait a minute, let&#39;s talk about the patient. The patient doesn&#39;t need a war.</p><p>It is reasonable to expect the doctor to recognize that science may not have all the answers to problems of health and healing.</p><p>Frequent worshippers are also significantly more active citizens. They are more likely to belong to community organizations, especially those concerned with young people, health, arts and leisure, neighborhood and civic groups and professional associations.</p><p>Walking is magic. Can&#39;t recommend it highly enough. I read that Plato and Aristotle did much of their brilliant thinking together while ambulating. The movement, the meditation, the health of the blood pumping, and the rhythm of footsteps...this is a primal way to connect with one&#39;s deeper self.</p><p>Health is not a condition of matter, but of Mind.</p><p>The accumulation of numbers always augments in some measure moral corruptions, and the consequences to health of the various vices incident thereto, are well known.</p><p>Japan actually is an aging population, and so as the population has aged, they have had a lot more problems with health.</p><p>The rise of childhood obesity has placed the health of an entire generation at risk.</p><p>It&#39;s about businesses nervous about taking on school leavers because of a mass of red tape. It&#39;s about health and safety regulations and green fines.</p><p>I don&#39;t think healthcare&#39;s a right. The only right you have is the ability to go out on an even playing field and work, and then purchase health insurance, or whatever it is.</p><p>As long as I have my health, I want to be reporting somewhere.</p><p>Hollywood... a city I was to come back to time and again, in sickness and in health, in success and in failure, with anticipation and with dread.</p><p>I always made my food congenial to my constitution, and my health was always excellent.</p><p>I learned very early that our health is always impaired by some excess either of food or abstinence, and I never had any physician except myself.</p><p>My personal feeling, if I can interject a political note, is that I don&#39;t think it is right that basic health care is a privilege. It shouldn&#39;t be. It should be a right of all human beings. And certainly in the richest country in the world.</p><p>I try to stay positive by focusing on how much I&#39;ll appreciate my health if I get better.</p><p>Furthermore, we believe that health care reform, again I said at the beginning of my remarks, that we sent the three pillars that the President&#39;s economic stabilization and job creation initiatives were education and innovation - innovation begins in the classroom - clean energy and climate, addressing the climate issues in an innovative way to keep us number one and competitive in the world with the new technology, and the third, first among equals I may say, is health care, health insurance reform.</p><p>I think about my parents all the time, especially on Sunday when I&#39;m at Mass. My mother always said, &#39;We do not pray to win elections. We pray for people&#39;s health, we pray that God&#39;s will be done, we pray that we do our best. But we do not pray to win elections.&#39;</p><p>For me, I am left leaning when it comes to health and education, on the right when it comes to defense. So I don&#39;t know where I come on the political spectrum. And I think this the challenge that a lot of Jordanians have to deal with.</p><p>Children born to teens have less supportive and stimulating environments, poorer health, lower cognitive development, and worse educational outcomes. Children of teen mothers are at increased risk of being in foster care and becoming teen parents themselves, thereby repeating the cycle.</p><p>Looking after my health today gives me a better hope for tomorrow.</p><p>Look, I hate to sound like Pollyanna, but I literally can&#39;t wait to get to work in the morning. I&#39;ve got steady jobs, I&#39;ve got my health, and I&#39;m here in the greatest city in the world. I&#39;d be a pig not to be grateful.</p><p>As the National Football League and other pro sports increasingly reckon with the early dementia, mental health issues, suicides and even criminal behavior of former players, the risk of what&#39;s known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), is becoming clear.</p><p>There&#39;s no one place a virus goes to die - but that doesn&#39;t make its demise any less a public health victory. Throughout human history, viral diseases have had their way with us, and for just as long, we have hunted them down and done our best to wipe them out.</p><p>And I believe that if we can care about whether or not our neighbor has a good job or access to affordable health care for their children, and we move to implement the policies that can improve these situations, we will unleash vast amounts of human potential and recapture the American spirit.</p><p>Our children&#39;s health and well-being are dependent on our commitment to promoting food access and good eating habits at home, at school and in the community.</p><p>If you&#39;re going to vote on a television contract, there is a certain rationality to saying that the same structures that are applied to Health Plan participation should be placed on the right to vote on a strike.</p><p>I would support a devolution of power out of Washington for education, health care, transportation.</p><p>It begins and ends with money. It&#39;s absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It&#39;s obscene.</p><p>All the evidence shows very clearly that if you are a member of a trade union you are likely to get better pay, more equal pay, better health and safety, more chance to get training, more chance to have conditions of work that help if you have caring responsibilities... the list goes on!</p><p>True health care reform cannot happen in Washington. It has to happen in our kitchens, in our homes, in our communities. All health care is personal.</p><p>We are spending most of our time in American health care fixing the mistakes that either we in the profession are causing or our patients are, without recognizing it, causing to themselves.</p><p>I saw many people who had advanced heart disease and I was so frustrated because I knew if they just knew how to do the right thing, simple lifestyle and diet steps, that the entire trajectory of their life and health would have been different.</p><p>Illegal immigration costs taxpayers $45 billion a year in health care, education, and incarceration expenses.</p><p>Lack of time is a real health killer.</p><p>Alaska is what happens when Willy Wonka and the witch from Hansel and Gretel elope, buy a place together upstate, renounce their sweet teeth, and turn into health fanatics.</p><p>When I was on Broadway, I got really sick with walking pneumonia. I decided not to take my health for granted anymore and make it a priority. The great thing is, the pounds just started to fall off.</p><p>And I think of that again as I&#39;ve written in several of my beauty books, a lot of health comes from the proper eating habits, which are something that - you know, I come from a generation that wasn&#39;t - didn&#39;t have a lot of food.</p><p>I think health is another exceedingly important thing.</p><p>I believe that parents need to make nutrition education a priority in their home environment. It&#39;s crucial for good health and longevity to instill in your children sound eating habits from an early age.</p><p>Many health care providers, particularly physicians in rural and urban areas, are leaving the Government programs because of inadequate reimbursement rates.</p><p>It&#39;s time to look beyond the budget ax to assure access to health care for all. It&#39;s time to look for bipartisan solutions to the problems we can tackle today, and to work together for tomorrow - building a health care system that works for all Americans.</p><p>Fixing health care and fixing the economy are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>For the amount of money that the country is going to spend this year on health care, you can go out and hire a doctor for every seven families in the US and pay the doctor almost $230,000 a year to cover them.</p><p>I believe the most important aspect of Medicare is not the structure of the program but the guarantee to all Americans that they will have high quality health care as they get older.</p><p>When the Veterans Affairs Department implemented a program to provide home-based health care to veterans with multiple chronic conditions - many of the system&#39;s most expensive patients to treat - they received astounding results.</p><p>Without Free Choice Vouchers, there is little in the health reform law that discourages employers from increasingly passing the burden of health care costs onto their employees.</p><p>The reality is that the special interest groups that have lobbied against Free Choice Vouchers object to any measure that would empower employees to have a say in their health benefits because it begins to erode their power in the current health care system.</p><p>It is hard to miss the irony in the fact that the very same week that Republicans were publicly heralding Congressman Paul Ryan&#39;s plan to inject market forces into the American health care system, they were crafting a budget deal to strip them from the health reform law.</p><p>While Free Choice Vouchers didn&#39;t fulfill my vision of a health care system in which every American would be empowered to hire and fire their insurance company, they were a foothold for choice and competition and a safety valve for Americans whose employers are already forcing them to bear more and more of their family&#39;s health insurance costs.</p><p>It&#39;s correct that I wanted health reform to do more to create choices and promote competition.</p><p>Americans are free to choose everything from what they eat, drive and watch on TV to the President of the United States. Yet, when it comes to allowing Americans to choose the health insurance that works best for them and their family, the freedom to choose suddenly becomes un-American.</p><p>I agree with just about everyone in the reform debate when they say &#39;If you like what you have, you should be able to keep it.&#39; But the truth is that none of the health reform bills making their way through Congress actually delivers on that promise.</p><p>If you like the health insurance that you have you should be able to keep it, but if you don&#39;t like the health insurance you have, you should be able to choose something else.</p><p>I believe that whether you love your job or hate your job, get laid off or are just in-between jobs, you deserve health care that can never be taken away.</p><p>Under the Healthy Americans Act, you&#39;re in charge of your health care - not your employer. If you lose your job, change jobs or just can&#39;t find a job, your health insurance is guaranteed to stick with you.</p><p>With a host of proposals on the table and a President examining new ideas for health reform, we have an obligation to give real reform our best shot.</p><p>To help the poor to a capacity for action and liberty is something essential for one&#39;s own health as well as theirs: there is a needful gift they have to offer which cannot be offered so long as they are confined by poverty.</p><p>Because of the president&#39;s leadership, every American will have access to affordable, quality health care.</p><p>Teaching kids about health and fitness is important to me.

Now I make smoothies with frozen berries and Green Vibrance health powder.</p><p>I am interested in getting people to use the healthcare system at the right time, getting them to see the doctor early enough, before a small health problem turns serious.</p><p>Hey &#39;Bachelor,&#39; take notes! Trusting one another and sharing a journey to health leads to lasting relationships!</p><p>One of the things I like best about &#39;Biggest Loser&#39; is being around people who are trying to make the right choices. When you feel defeated about your weight and your health, like there&#39;s no hope, and you still make the choice to fight for it, to make the change happen no matter what people say or think, that&#39;s inspiring to me.</p><p>Nothing is more capable of troubling our reason, and consuming our health, than secret notions of jealousy in solitude.</p><p>I&#39;m happy that I feel a little less out of place in filmmaking than I once was - but it&#39;s almost impossible for a playwright in the U.S. to make a living. You can have a play, like I did with &#39;Angels,&#39; and it still generates income for me, but it&#39;s not enough for me to live on and have health insurance.</p><p>Each State has its own health insurance mandates, and some of them are good, but there are about 1,800 of them all across the Nation, including provisions for acupuncturists, massage therapists, and hair replacements.</p><p>We need better neighbors, neighbors that care about the schools in their neighborhood whether they have kids in them or not, because they know that the health and vitality of that neighborhood depends on it.</p><p>Make no mistake, a &#39;yes&#39; vote on the Democrats&#39; health care bill is a vote for taxpayer-funded abortions.</p><p>The public health of five million children should not be left to luck or chance.</p><p>Productive achievement is a consequence and an expression of health and self-esteem, not its cause.</p><p>The health effects of air pollution imperil human lives. This fact is well-documented.</p><p>Today we have a health insurance industry where the first and foremost goal is to maximize profits for shareholders and CEOs, not to cover patients who have fallen ill or to compensate doctors and hospitals for their services. It is an industry that is increasingly concentrated and where Americans are paying more to receive less.</p><p>America has the best doctors, the best nurses, the best hospitals, the best medical technology, the best medical breakthrough medicines in the world. There is absolutely no reason we should not have in this country the best health care in the world.</p><p>Well, the truth is that a lot of people lie about their health, they lie about the finances, they lie about things at work, they lie about things.</p><p>I don&#39;t know of a Democrat - whether they&#39;re a conservative, a centrist or a liberal Democrat - that doesn&#39;t think that it&#39;s important to have quality jobs that pay decent wages so that families can support themselves, so that they can have the dignity of being able to afford health care, put money aside for pension, buy a home.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if there is a Democrat who necessarily doesn&#39;t believe health care is a right instead of privilege. There is a significant between us and the Republican Party on that issue.</p><p>We know that there are significant health benefits from consuming more fruits and vegetables, and that&#39;s an opportunity for us to sort of move away from some of the meals that we&#39;ve been preparing in the past.</p><p>I have no regrets. I&#39;ve got my health.</p><p>Spiritually good people, pure in heart, who long for the Blessed Sacrament but cannot receive at the time, can receive spiritually... even a hundred times a day, in sickness and in health, with immeasurable grace and profit.</p><p>I&#39;m 58 years old and I just went through 8 back surgeries. They started cutting on me in February 2009, and I was basically bed ridden for almost two years. I got a real dose of reality that if you don&#39;t have your health, you don&#39;t have anything.</p><p>I have a lot of health anxiety.</p><p>Advances in technology will continue to reach far into every sector of our economy. Future job and economic growth in industry, defense, transportation, agriculture, health care, and life sciences is directly related to scientific advancement.</p><p>Many smart folks seem to think that if you just get your metaphors and messages right, you&#39;ll win. That if you start describing what you favor as a &#39;moral value&#39; - &#39;affordable health care is a moral value&#39; etc., - then you&#39;ll appeal to red-state voters.</p><p>There are all kinds of things you can do to marry literacy with health.</p><p>I think that age as a number is not nearly as important as health. You can be in poor health and be pretty miserable at 40 or 50. If you&#39;re in good health, you can enjoy things into your 80s.</p><p>I&#39;d like to see the health care professionals making decisions, not some bureaucrat in Indianapolis working for an insurance company.</p><p>Voters did say &#39;repeal health care,&#39; they did say &#39;reduce the size of government.&#39; But not a single one of them from the tea party or anywhere said &#39;give tax breaks to the wealthiest.&#39;</p><p>I became a vegetarian out of compassion for animals and to live as healthy as possible. I realized soon after that I was truly concerned with nonviolent consumption and my own health, a vegan diet was the best decision.</p><p>I&#39;m by no means condemning prescription medicine for mental health. I&#39;ve seen it save a lot of people&#39;s lives.</p><p>We are all born with a unique genetic blueprint, which lays out the basic characteristics of our personality as well as our physical health and appearance... And yet, we all know that life experiences do change us.</p><p>Women are half the population and they know how to take care of themselves, if they are only given access to health care.</p><p>The idea of making access to safe abortions harder and more expensive and more difficult, having to travel across state lines - that puts women&#39;s health and lives in jeopardy, which is something I think no one wants.</p><p>Women&#39;s health needs to be front and center - it often isn&#39;t, but it needs to be.</p><p>The more easily digestible and refined the carbohydrates, the greater the effect on our health, weight and well-being.</p><p>Most American diets, even bad ones, provide more than enough calcium for bone health, especially for men.</p><p>I fully support a national health care program for the U.S.</p><p>One of the most obvious ways dogs can improve our physical and mental health is via daily walks.</p><p>The bottom line is that the human body is complex and subtle, and oversimplifying - as common sense sometimes impels us to do - can be hazardous to your health.</p><p>Human beings have survived for millennia because most of us make good decisions about our health most of the time.</p><p>If we can make the correct diagnosis, the healing can begin. If we can&#39;t, both our personal health and our economy are doomed.</p><p>The World Health Organization has recognized acupuncture as effective in treating mild to moderate depression.</p><p>I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America. We have a disease-management system - one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet, lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy.</p><p>I am not against all forms of high-tech medicine. Drugs and surgeries have a secure place in the treatment of serious health conditions. But modern American medicine treats almost every health condition as if it were an emergency.</p><p>The most common objection that I hear to walking as exercise is that it&#39;s too easy, that only sweaty, strenuous activity offers real benefits. But there is abundant evidence that regular, brisk walking is associated with better health, including lower blood pressure, better moods and improved cholesterol ratios.</p><p>It does kids no favors, and sets them up for a potential lifetime of poor health and social embarrassment, to excuse them from family meals of real food. Everyone benefits from healthy eating, but it is particularly crucial at the beginning of life.</p><p>Citizens must pressure the American Hospital Association, the American Public Health Association, the Centers for Disease Control and other relevant governmental agencies to make greening our hospitals and medical centers a top priority so that they themselves don&#39;t create even more illness.</p><p>We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.</p><p>As an American, you have a right to good health care that is effective, accessible, and affordable, that serves you from infancy through old age, that allows you to go to practitioners and facilities of your choosing, and that offers a broad range of therapeutic options.</p><p>You can&#39;t afford to get sick, and you can&#39;t depend on the present health care system to keep you well. It&#39;s up to you to protect and maintain your body&#39;s innate capacity for health and healing by making the right choices in how you live.</p><p>Whenever I write about mental health and integrative therapies, I am accused of being prejudiced against pharmaceuticals. So let me be clear - integrative medicine is the judicious application of both conventional and evidence-based natural therapies.</p><p>The health care system is really designed to reward you for being unhealthy. If you are a healthy person and work hard to be healthy, there are no benefits.</p><p>Oh my gosh, I feel like I&#39;m really obsessive about anything dealing with my health.</p><p>I&#39;ve always enjoyed poor health.</p><p>Most of the provisions designed to fix what ails our health system don&#39;t kick in until 2014, which, one wishes administration officials had noticed, is two years after he has to win an election.</p><p>Yes. I think the anti-Wal-Mart is Costco, which pays much better and has much better health benefits and which is profitable and offers low prices.</p><p>When a woman earns a dollar, the payback is higher. She&#39;ll invest in her children, in their education, health care, and basic needs. The impact of a woman&#39;s role in the economy benefits society at large.</p><p>You should be able to afford health care for your family. You should be able to retire with dignity and respect. And you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger, go even farther and accomplish even more than you could ever imagine.</p><p>TV does not care about you or what happens to you. It&#39;s downright bad for your health now, and that&#39;s not a far-out concept. I think watching the TV news is bad for you. It is bad for your physical health and your mental health.</p><p>I am trying to inspire people to just take control of their oral health, because if we don&#39;t take care of our oral health, it affects so many different aspects of our lives. If your smile and mouth is not together, it affects your relationship, your self-esteem, your health.</p><p>Mark Ruffalo, aka the Incredible Hulk, is the natural gas industry&#39;s worst nightmare: a serious, committed activist who is determined to use his star power as a superhero in the hottest movie of the moment to draw attention the environmental and public health risks of fracking.</p><p>The biggest tab the public picks up for fossil fuels has to do with what economists call &#39;external costs,&#39; like the health effects of air and water pollution.</p><p>In this country, the health concerns and the environmental concerns are as deep as in Europe. All the surveys show that. But here, we didn&#39;t have the cultural dimension. This is a fast-food culture.</p><p>From this experience we have learned that in a big party it is important to have the necessary and often controversial discussions on policy issues such as the health system while in opposition.</p><p>As I mentioned previously, the tools that allow for optimum health are diet and exercise.</p><p>Prevention is one of the few known ways to reduce demand for health and aged care services.</p><p>We designed both our state employee health plans and the one we created for low-income Hoosiers as Health Savings Accounts, and now in the tens of thousands these citizens are proving that they are fully capable of making smart, consumerist choices about their own health care.</p><p>Left to ourselves, we might pick the wrong health insurance, the wrong mortgage, the wrong school for our kids why, unless they stop us, we might pick the wrong light bulb.</p><p>Why do we have 47 million people without health care? Because America has become about &#39;me&#39;. What&#39;s happened to &#39;we&#39; as a people? I believe in that and that resonates to most people.</p><p>We cannot rest until we make sure that our families can afford to live and raise their kids here, that our seniors can remain in their homes and afford their health and pharmaceutical costs.</p><p>If you look at things that really affect people&#39;s lives - sport, the arts, charities - they were always at the back of the queue for government money - health, social security, defence, pensions were all way ahead. And each of those areas - sports, the arts, the lottery - got relatively petty cash from the government.</p><p>It&#39;s totally different from last year because I came in with good shape with no health worries so it was about going out there and running well and enjoying it.</p><p>I can understand why some people might look at me and say, &#39;What&#39;s she got to be depressed about?&#39; I get that a lot in Britain, where mental health issues seem to be a big taboo.</p><p>You go to Scandinavia, and you will find that people have a much higher standard of living, in terms of education, health care and decent paying jobs.</p><p>High-quality food is better for your health.</p><p>I think the British people are very, very attached to the idea that the health service is free at the point of use. But there is no reason why every doctor, nurse and teacher in this country has to be employed by the state.</p><p>If I have my health I can carry on. There will be a point when I do quit but I have absolutely no idea when that is.</p><p>I&#39;m very confident my health isn&#39;t going to allow me to be a good player, especially in the spring.</p><p>But if you&#39;re asking my opinion, I would argue that a social justice approach should be central to medicine and utilized to be central to public health. This could be very simple: the well should take care of the sick.</p><p>We&#39;ve taken on the major health problems of the poorest - tuberculosis, maternal mortality, AIDS, malaria - in four countries. We&#39;ve scored some victories in the sense that we&#39;ve cured or treated thousands and changed the discourse about what is possible.</p><p>The biggest public health challenge is rebuilding health systems. In other words, if you look at cholera or maternal mortality or tuberculosis in Haiti, they&#39;re major problems in Haiti, but the biggest problem is rebuilding systems.</p><p>Once brave politicians and others explain the war on drugs&#39; true cost, the American people will scream for a cease-fire. Bring the troops home, people will urge. Treat drugs as a health problem, not as a matter for the criminal justice system.</p><p>If you&#39;re too embarrassed and want to hide behind your computer screen, that&#39;s what this is for. It&#39;s about building confidence and that&#39;s what U by Kotex does. Girls owning their bodies and health.</p><p>One of the jewels in the crown of Labour&#39;s time in office was the rescue of the National Health Service. As the Commonwealth Fund, the London School of Economics and the Nuffield Foundation have all shown, health reforms as well as additional investment were essential to improved outcomes, especially for poorer patients.</p><p>Because we spoke so loudly, opponents of reproductive health access demonized and smeared me and others on the public airwaves. These smears are obvious attempts to distract from meaningful policy discussions and to silence women&#39;s voices regarding their own health care.</p><p>But you say, does it represent change? The change is that we are fighting an insurance industry that has killed health reform for generations. They&#39;re spending tens of millions of dollars right now to defeat this bill, and we&#39;re on the doorstep of winning a great victory for the American people.</p><p>When bureaucrats talk about increasing our &#39;access&#39; to x, y or z, what they&#39;re really talking about is increasing exponentially their control over our lives. As it is with the government health care takeover, so it is with the newly approved government plan to &#39;increase&#39; Internet &#39;access.&#39;</p><p>For the past two years, President Obama has promised our children the moon, stars, rainbows, unicorns and universal health care for all. But the White House Santa&#39;s cradle-to-grave entitlement mandates are a spectacularly predictable bust.</p><p>If Obama wanted to make radical changes to America&#39;s health long-term, all he has to do is treble the price of sugar and salt.</p><p>I admit it: I had fun watching right-wingers go wild as health reform finally became law.</p><p>I&#39;m on a health kick! I&#39;m drawn to cheeseburgers, so I&#39;ve got to just try and keep it on an even keel.</p><p>We can never, ever say it enough: every woman - especially every young woman-has to take charge of her health... and do what&#39;s right for her!</p><p>And so to those who suggest that we are somehow &#39;harming&#39; young women by encouraging them to take charge of their health we say this: We are not harming young women by educating them. We are arming them with information that they will carry with them throughout their lives.</p><p>Both referred to the Affordable Care Act, which is the accurate title of the health care reform law, as &#39;Obamacare.&#39; That is a disparaging reference to the President of the United States, it is meant as a disparaging reference to the President of the United States.</p><p>When President Obama passed health care reform, it was personal! And when Governor Romney says he would repeal Obamacare and put insurance companies back in charge of a woman&#39;s health, that&#39;s personal too.</p><p>As the President reviewed the state of the union and unveiled his second-term agenda, he fell short of adequately explaining how he intends to set America back on the course of fiscal responsibility and secure the fiscal health of the nation.</p><p>Mental agitations and eating cares are more injurious to health, and destructive of life, than is commonly imagined, and could their effects be collected, would make no inconsiderable figure in the bills of mortality.</p><p>It&#39;s never too late to take your heart health seriously and make it a priority.</p><p>Investing in health will produce enormous benefits.</p><p>You cannot achieve environmental security and human development without addressing the basic issues of health and nutrition.</p><p>I have always detested any departure from reality, an attitude which I relate to my mother&#39;s poor mental health.</p><p>When the Nobel award came my way, it also gave me an opportunity to do something immediate and practical about my old obsessions, including literacy, basic health care and gender equity, aimed specifically at India and Bangladesh.</p><p>The five different areas in which boys are in crisis - education jobs emotional health physical health and fatherlessness - are handled by different portions of the government.</p><p>Medical professionals, not insurance company bureaucrats, should be making health care decisions.</p><p>Look, all this is about is utilizing the rules of the Senate, using a majority of the senators, to make sure that we get health reform done. We cannot wait another day.</p><p>It is true that too much belief can be bad for your health.</p><p>Happiness lies first of all in health.</p><p>Today&#39;s business and health care climate may not be pleasant. Cutbacks, pay cuts and layoffs do not make anyone&#39;s job easy. But that does not mean that the humor need stop.</p><p>I&#39;m a parent, and I try to take care of my health and keep my life in order. In the last few years I&#39;ve really had to decide what&#39;s important to me, and it seems to me that my family and my health are top on the list. And those have nothing to do with show business.</p><p>The arts have always been an important ingredient to the health of a nation, but we haven&#39;t gotten there yet.</p><p>From dear, dear Gloria Swanson, I learned how to live long, happy and free of health problems. I owe her my life.</p><p>We all want more information available when making health care decisions for ourselves and our families.</p><p>By cutting critical domestic programs such as education, health, environmental protection, and veterans&#39; services, this budget reveals misplaced priorities.</p><p>No employer is going to hire robustly until they know what the health care cost is going to be.</p><p>It&#39;s wonderful that so many people want to contribute to fighting aids or malaria. But, if somebody isn&#39;t paying attention to the overall health system in the country, a whole lot of money can be wasted.</p><p>Age does not depend upon years, but upon temperament and health. Some men are born old, and some never grow so.</p><p>Sleep is that golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.</p><p>Building a new Health and Hospitals Network is fundamental to building a stronger and fairer Australia.</p><p>The Australian Government&#39;s decision to take on the dominant funding role for the entire public hospital system is designed to: end the blame game eliminate waste and to shoulder the funding burden of the rapidly rising health costs of the future.</p><p>If the states and territories do not sign up to fundamental reform, then my message is equally simple: we will take this reform plan to the people at the next election - along with a referendum by or at that same election to give the Australian Government all the power it needs to reform the health system.</p><p>These are important reforms. Infrastructure, education, health, hospitals, closing the gap with indigenous Australians. Also the Apology to the first Australians. As Prime Minister of the country I am proud of each and every one of these achievements.</p><p>I am in very good health. I&#39;ve never felt better.</p><p>I&#39;m always active in trying to educate people when it comes to eating animal products, testing on animals, and the health benefits of being vegan, although I&#39;m probably not the best person to be talking about the latter at the moment.</p><p>I&#39;m against big bureaucracy in Washington making health care decisions. I just have an aversion to bureaucrats. But it&#39;s not just government bureaucrats. I don&#39;t like HMO bureaucrats and insurance company bureaucrats either.</p><p>And under the existing circumstances, I understand there are situations where people indeed need care and need services, but I believe in America that the majority of those people are getting those services under situations and circumstances that are afforded to them by their health care providers and their state government.</p><p>We have over 500,000 illegal immigrants living in Arizona. And we simply cannot sustain it. It costs us a tremendous amount of money of course in health care, in education, and then, on top of it all, in incarceration. And the federal government doesn&#39;t reimburse us on any of these things.</p><p>The truth is I had lots of rehab and now I have a clean bill of health.</p><p>I am passionate about talking to women about their breast health.</p><p>When you start fooling around with drugs, you&#39;re hurting your creativity, you&#39;re hurting your health. Drugs are death, in one form or another. If they don&#39;t kill you, they kill your soul. And if your soul&#39;s dead, you&#39;ve got nothing to offer, anyway.</p><p>Do you suppose there is any living man so unreasonable that if he found himself stricken with a dangerous ailment he would not anxiously desire to regain the blessing of health?</p><p>I believe in health care reform.</p><p>In my forties, my optimism was boundless. I had really good health and tremendous success which allowed me to do anything I wanted.</p><p>Better understanding of the natural world not only enhances all of us as human beings, but can also be harnessed for the better good, leading to improved health and quality of life.</p><p>I have health. I have a wonderful support system. I have the admiration of millions of strangers, which I do not underestimate.</p><p>I basically believe the medical insurance industry should be nonprofit, not profit-making. There is no way a health reform plan will work when it is implemented by an industry that seeks to return money to shareholders instead of using that money to provide health care.</p><p>When you get older, your health becomes important to you, things start breaking down, you&#39;ve always got a different ache or pain.</p><p>Aaron Pryor wants to get into the ring with me. He wants to be able to retire, and he will. For health reasons.</p><p>You bet every member of Congress who votes for this bill ought to read it, read it thoroughly, and understand that what we&#39;re looking at here amounts to nothing more than a government takeover of our health care economy, paid for with nearly a trillion dollars in new taxes on individuals and small businesses. And it must be opposed.</p><p>Most of the State of the Union will not be about Iraq. Most of the State of the Union will be about improving America&#39;s economy and providing greater access to health care for millions of American people, including senior citizens.</p><p>I believe you need scientific proof that something works before you entrust your health to it.</p><p>There is much that public policy can do to support American entrepreneurs. Health insurance reform will make it easier for entrepreneurs to take a chance on a new business without putting their family&#39;s health at risk. Tort reform will make it easier to take prudent risks on new products in a number of sectors.</p><p>Here in Silicon Valley, I have taken part in hundreds of conversations trying to convince people to dive in and become entrepreneurs. All too often, innovators with good, safe, jobs are unwilling to put their family&#39;s access to health care at risk by walking away from company-backed medical insurance.</p><p>Balance is key: I need to be successful in my career to feel fulfilled, be surrounded by people I care about to share it with, and have my health to be able to do the things I love to do!</p><p>The voice collects and translates your bad physical health, your emotional worries, your personal troubles.</p><p>When elected officials abandon our environment and ruin our natural resources, public health is endangered. I know the importance of providing a clean environment for our children I have attended more than one funeral for a child who has died from an asthma attack.</p><p>The fact is, if our primary legislative goals are to repeal and replace the health spending bill to end the bailouts cut spending and shrink the size and scope of government, the only way to do all these things it is to put someone in the White House who won&#39;t veto any of these things.</p><p>When women earn the money for the family, everyone in the family benefits. We also know that when women have an income, everyone wins because women dedicate 90% of the income to health, education, to food security, to the children, to the family, or to the community, so when women have an income, everybody wins.</p><p>We simply can no longer afford to deny the full potential of one half of the population. The world needs to tap into the talent and wisdom of women. Whether the issue is food security, economic recovery, health, or peace and security, the participation of women is needed now more than ever.</p><p>As a doctor, when I was minister of health and would go somewhere, little girls would come up to me and say, &#39;I want to be like you one day, I want to be a doctor.&#39; Now, they tell me, &#39;I want to be president just like you.&#39; All of us can dream as big as we want.</p><p>Advances in science and medical research and public health policies have meant that life expectancy for Australians is one of the highest in the world.</p><p>I&#39;m active in PAX, which is a gun awareness organization. We treat gun safety as a public health issue.</p><p>When the courts decide that murderers, rapists, and others who maliciously break our social contract deserve health care that most working Americans can&#39;t afford, they are condemning good people to death.</p><p>We are all ill: but even a universal sickness implies an idea of health.</p><p>You may keep your beauty and your health, unless you destroy them yourself, or discourage them to stay with you, by using them ill.</p><p>Economists are coming to acknowledge that measures of national wealth and poverty in terms strictly of average income tell you little that is significant of the health or viability of a society.</p><p>In sharp contrast to the idea that this stage of life is enviable, we hear high levels of anxiety about getting old, anxieties about health, mobility, access to facilities, simple routine care and attention.</p><p>The answer was that in Burundi, having a clean bill of health has taken on a very particular meaning: unless and until you have paid for your hospital treatment, you simply can&#39;t leave, you are in effect a captive.</p><p>People take the mickey out of mental health, but it is very delicate.</p><p>Over 120 Aboriginal communities run their own health services - some have been doing so for 30 years. They struggle with difficult medical problems. They also try to deal with counselling, stolen generations issues, family relationships, violence, suicide prevention.</p><p>I&#39;m actually tougher on myself as I get older. It&#39;s a vicious cycle. The things that are important in life are the things that you can&#39;t buy in life: love, health and happiness. I say that, and I believe that, and I try to live that.</p><p>My health is good and it&#39;s up to me to keep it that way.</p><p>I want to see far more decisions taken far closer to the patients, the passengers and the pupils. Far more power for locally and regionally elected politicians who understand best the needs of their areas. And far more say too for the dedicated staff at all levels in health and education.</p><p>I should do something about the cigarettes I quite accept that it&#39;s bad for your health, but you know a moderate tipple is positively beneficial and, at certain times, absolutely essential.</p><p>These are the same people who believe, in some cases, the federal government should not play any role in providing health care to our people or protecting the environment.</p><p>People don&#39;t trust private health insurance companies for all the right reasons.</p><p>If the goal of health-care reform is to provide comprehensive, universal health care in a cost-effective way, the only honest approach is a single-payer approach.</p><p>As a single-payer advocate, I believe that at the end of the day, if a state goes forward and passed an effective single-payer program, it will demonstrate that you can provide quality health care to every man, woman and child in a more cost-effective way.</p><p>Look, if you have somebody who doesn&#39;t have health insurance, who doesn&#39;t have a doctor or dentist, and in order to deal with their cold or flu or dental problem, they go to an emergency room - in general, that visit will cost ten times more than walking into a community health center.</p><p>I believe that investing in our children&#39;s development from the earliest age is the single most important contribution we can make to the health and wellbeing of our citizens, their capacity and the future prosperity of our state.</p><p>As I go to sleep I remember what my father said-that one can never be sure if one will awake. The way my health is now, this is becoming more and more real.</p><p>I think that everyone is saying all kinds of things about &#39;rich.&#39; Not only am I rich from doing some of things I&#39;ve been able to do, but I&#39;m rich in spirit. I&#39;m rich in health. I&#39;m rich in every way possible.</p><p>Like it or not, in the end, it&#39;s one&#39;s body. It&#39;s literally what carries you through life. There&#39;s a reason for the saying, &#39;If you have your health, you have everything,&#39; and it&#39;s true. Old age, disease - these are the great equalizers.</p><p>The Supreme Court has never ruled that Congress can use the Commerce Clause to require individuals to engage in an activity they have chosen to avoid. Yet that is precisely what Obamacare does: It forces Americans without health insurance to purchase coverage. Such a requirement is unprecedented and unconstitutional.</p><p>In other words we have marketed our way into this health crisis.</p><p>So I can&#39;t show you how, exactly, health care is a basic human right. But what I can argue is that no one should have to die of a disease that is treatable.</p><p>If any country was a mine-shaft canary for the reintroduction of cholera, it was Haiti - and we knew it. And in retrospect, more should have been done to prepare for cholera... which can spread like wildfire in Haiti... This was a big rebuke to all of us working in public health and health care in Haiti.</p><p>You can&#39;t have public health without a public health system. We just don&#39;t want to be part of a mindless competition for resources. We want to build back capacity in the system.</p><p>When I ran for Congress I promised to help make health care affordable again.</p><p>My background is in health care.</p><p>I know the exploding cost of health care is at the root of our long-term fiscal challenges.</p><p>Prior to passage of Obamacare, Americans spoke out against the individual mandate they didn&#39;t want to change the health care they had they didn&#39;t want a 3,000-page bill that empowered 15 Washington bureaucrats to decide the future of the doctor-patient relationship.</p><p>Americans want and deserve a broad array of health insurance choices so they can identify those that best fit their own individual or family needs. These choices expand when we allow free enterprise to foster innovation, not smother it with taxes and one-size fits all ideology.</p><p>Under President Obama&#39;s new health care law, Medicaid will become a very different health coverage program than first envisioned.</p><p>Originally created to serve the poorest and sickest among us, the Medicaid program has grown dramatically but still doesn&#39;t include the kind of flexibility that states need to provide better health care for the poor and disadvantaged.</p><p>The national debate on health care once centered on improving access to quality care, yet the effect of Obamacare will be the exact opposite, resulting in the shameful degradation of care for the neediest individuals.</p><p>Obamacare is a seriously flawed law that makes health care coverage less affordable, costs taxpayers more than advertised and fails to deliver on most of its other grand promises.</p><p>Giving governors more leeway in administering health care could represent a small, positive development in the ongoing saga of Obamacare. Unfortunately, instead of choosing flexibility, President Obama and his left-leaning advisers always default to rigid &#39;Washington knows best&#39; answers.</p><p>The real truth is that the Obama administration is professional at bullying, as we have witnessed with ACORN at work during the presidential campaign. It seems to me they are sending down their bullies to create fist fights among average American citizens who don&#39;t want a government-run health care plan forced upon them.</p><p>Money spent on carbon cuts is money we can&#39;t use for effective investments in food aid, micronutrients, HIV/AIDS prevention, health and education infrastructure, and clean water and sanitation.</p><p>We are losing our living systems, social systems, cultural systems, governing systems, stability, and our constitutional health, and we&#39;re surrendering it all at the same time.</p><p>I am actually in poor health due to chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome, and my ability to work is greatly diminished right now, so I have to get better before I can start another big project.</p><p>I am now almost certain that we need more radiation for better health.</p><p>The way I feel today, as long as my health is good and I can handle myself well and people still come to my concerts, still buy my CDs, I&#39;ll keep playing until I feel like I can&#39;t.</p><p>Exercise keeps me occupied, which is good for my mental health.</p><p>By adopting a wonderful mutt, you&#39;ll save a life and help reduce animal homelessness while also boosting your chances of a more robust new furry friend, as mixed-breed dogs have demonstrated better health and longer life spans than their purebred cousins.</p><p>People are ready to say, &#39;Yes, we are ready for single-payer health insurance.&#39; We are the only industrialized country in the world that does not have national health insurance. We are the richest in wealth and the poorest in health of all the industrial nations.</p><p>That&#39;s why I wrote this book: to show how these people can imbue us with hope. I read somewhere that when a person takes part in community action, his health improves. Something happens to him or to her biologically. It&#39;s like a tonic.</p><p>Everyone should have health insurance? I say everyone should have health care. I&#39;m not selling insurance.</p><p>I believe health care is a civil right.</p><p>I have worked to expand the health care debate beyond the current for-profit system, to include a public option and an amendment to free the states to pursue single payer.</p><p>In the past week it has become clear that the vote on the final healthcare bill will be very close. I take this vote with the utmost seriousness. I am quite aware of the historic fight that has lasted the better part of the last century to bring America in line with other modern democracies in providing single payer health care.</p><p>Order is the sanity of the mind, the health of the body, the peace of the city, the security of the state. Like beams in a house or bones to a body, so is order to all things.</p><p>I would like to be as fit as I&#39;ve always been. I&#39;ve been blessed with good health, I&#39;ve been blessed with stamina. Particularly for those great classical roles, you need an Olympian stamina. I, fortunately, have that.</p><p>The issues that matter to me are the social safety nets for people, health care, middle-class concerns. We need to take care of the middle class and the poor in our country.</p><p>We will always make sure player health and safety is our No. 1 priority in the NFL.</p><p>The fact is if we do our job right, if we keep worrying not about polls but about the jobs of the American people, about their health care, about their ability to educate their kids, stay in their homes and own their homes, send their kids to college, the basic pillars of a middle-class life, if we keep worrying about the future and building a stronger future for this country, these things will take care of themselves.</p><p>I think that the millions and millions of young Americans, young Americans, who have health care today, who wouldn&#39;t have had it if the president hadn&#39;t acted are better off.</p><p>My father was a small-town banker. He became very ill when I was 10 years old, and we went to California three years later in an attempt to recover his health, which never happened.</p><p>My hobbies include maintaining my physical and mental health. It&#39;s a full-time job. Yoga definitely helps for both of them. I&#39;m a big fan of relaxing and not having a schedule. That&#39;s my best way to keep from going crazy.</p><p>It became obvious in 1957 that I was endangering my health by carrying so much weight.</p><p>As an integral part of the Department of Agriculture, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service monitors our Nation&#39;s agriculture to protect against agricultural pests and diseases.</p><p>Nurses are an integral component of the health care system, and it is important that we recognize the over 2.7 million registered nurses for the significant work that they do.</p><p>Well, you know my number one cause has always been that women&#39;s reproductive health needs to be protected.</p><p>I work very hard on my health, and I think about it, of course, like I&#39;ve never thought before.</p><p>In mid-May, the House of Representatives approved the full amount of money that the Veterans Administration said was needed for next year - plus an additional $1 billion increase for veterans&#39; health care.</p><p>Years ago nobody was elected on the economic ticket. It was either the education platform, or it was health or it was other issues. It is only recently that economic values have superceded every other human value.</p><p>I think there&#39;s a lot of work to be done with our societies. My biggest passions are the environment and health. And when I say &#39;health&#39; I mean the secrets behind health and our food system.</p><p>Studies have shown that inmate participation in education, vocational and job training, prison work skills development, drug abuse, mental health and other treatment programs, all reduce recidivism, significantly.</p><p>We are particularly interested in the mental health programs and policies that support our troops and their families before, during, and after deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>The minute health care becomes a huge, unwieldy, expensive government bureaucracy it&#39;s a permanent feature of life and there&#39;s nothing anyone can do about it.</p><p>There&#39;s definitely evidence that capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior. When you look at the worst corners of the American health insurance industry or the sub-prime banking market, it really feels like the more psychopathically someone behaves, the more it&#39;s rewarded.</p><p>There should not be one new dime in tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires as long as millions of children in America are poor, hungry, uneducated and without health coverage.</p><p>It was very clear to me in 1965, in Mississippi, that, as a lawyer, I could get people into schools, desegregate the schools, but if they were kicked off the plantations - and if they didn&#39;t have food, didn&#39;t have jobs, didn&#39;t have health care, didn&#39;t have the means to exercise those civil rights, we were not going to have success.</p><p>The U.N. Population Fund has a maternal health program in some Cameroon hospitals, but it doesn&#39;t operate in this region. It&#39;s difficult to expand, because President Bush has cut funding.</p><p>Neither left nor right has focused adequately on maternal health.</p><p>Health care comprises nearly 20 percent of our national economy, but outdated bureaucracy and red tape have stifled competition and raised costs. As a result, today more than 45 million are without any health coverage.</p><p>I really believe that beauty comes from health - sensible eating and exercise.</p><p>Third issue, and again I think it is important to note, anyone can make a mistake and any administration can make a mistake once in a while, but this is just a long train of abuses, an unbroken chain of following special interests rather than the health of the American people.</p><p>Challenges of historic import threaten America&#39;s future. Action on the deficit, economy, energy, health care and much more is imperative, yet our legislative institutions fail to act. Congress must be reformed.</p><p>Everybody likes Johnny Cash. I think the sad part of it is his health is givin&#39; him problems.</p><p>I am hopeful for the American people that we can actually improve the outlook for bringing down costs in health care.</p><p>We&#39;ve had Town Hall meetings, we&#39;ve witnessed election after election, in which the American people have taken a position on the President&#39;s health care bill. And the bottom line is the people don&#39;t like this bill. They don&#39;t want it.</p><p>You know, there are people making a lot of money in this country who can actually afford their own health care. We are in a situation where we got a safety net in place in this country for people who frankly don&#39;t need one. We got to focus on making sure we got a safety net for those who actually need it.</p><p>Finally, the ecological health of the Mississippi River and its economic importance to the many people that make their living or seek their recreation is based on a healthy river system.</p><p>As founder and co-chair of the upper Mississippi River Congressional task force, I have long sought to preserve the river&#39;s health and historical multiple uses, including as a natural waterway and a home to wildlife, for the benefit of future generations of Americans.</p><p>Nor is it the least advantage to health, accruing from such a way of life, that it expose those who follow it to fewer temptations to vice, than persons who live in crowded society.</p><p>The best advice is to avoid foods with health claims on the label, or better yet avoid foods with labels in the first place.</p><p>Because what happens is, as the economy suffers, tax revenues go down. But unlike businesses, where at least your variable costs go down, in government your variable costs go up: unemployment insurance, workmen&#39;s compensation, health care benefits, welfare, you name it.</p><p>It has pleased and interested me to see how I could get along under difficult circumstances and with so much discomfort but as I say I was not sent out here to improve my temper or my health or to make me more content with my good things in the East.</p><p>We each have a personal myth, a vision of who we really are and what we want. Health means that part of what you want is to give to others.</p><p>I understand that in these difficult economic times, the potential for any additional expense is not welcomed by American businesses. But in the long run, the health insurance reform law promises to cut health-care costs for U.S. businesses, not expand them.</p><p>The concern right now is that families are paying for insurance, or getting insurance from their employer and trusting that health care will be available for their families. In too many instances now, the care they need isn&#39;t available.</p><p>I think that we have a number of different health care challenges in our country, and certainly addressing the uninsured is one, and the second is making sure that those with health insurance actually get the care that they assume they&#39;ll have available to them if they get sick.</p><p>The Patients&#39; Bill of Rights is necessary to guarantee that health care will be available for those who are paying for insurance. It&#39;s a part of the overall health care picture.</p><p>When I turned 30, due to my father&#39;s heart history and my family genetics, I vowed to start seeing a cardiologist every year and just really be proactive and take my own heart health into my own hands.</p><p>I want to encourage everyone to be proactive with their health and get checked out.</p><p>During my nearly five years as director-general of WHO, high-level policymakers have increasingly recognized that health is central to sustainable development.</p><p>Health is the core of human development.</p><p>Intervention for the prevention and control of osteoporosis should comprise a combination of legislative action, educational measures, health service activities, media coverage, and individual counselling to initiate changes in behaviour.</p><p>Since the reduction of risk factors is the scientific basis for primary prevention, the World Health Organization promotes the development of an integrated strategy for prevention of several diseases, rather than focusing on individual ones.</p><p>That the AIDS pandemic is threatening sustainable development in Africa only reinforces the reality that health is at the center of sustainable development.</p><p>Women&#39;s health is one of WHO&#39;s highest priorities.</p><p>This is a historic moment in global public health, demonstrating the international will to tackle a threat to health head on.</p><p>This syndrome, SARS, is now a worldwide health threat... The world needs to work together to find its cause, cure the sick and stop its spread.</p><p>When they favor the access of other people to education and health care, the countries of the North not only demonstrate generosity or solidarity, but also implement the principles of respecting and promoting human rights.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s government&#39;s job to find health care for people. I think it&#39;s the individual&#39;s job to find health care.</p><p>I think the first and principle objective is to repeal Obamacare before it does lasting, fundamental damage to our health care system, to our individual liberty, to the relationship each of us has with his or her doctor.</p><p>My motivation has always been health - eating healthy and taking care of myself.</p><p>With a lot of hair and make-up then I&#39;m possibly, remotely attractive. But it&#39;s rare, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ugly but I&#39;m nothing particularly special. I&#39;m not a yoga and health girl. I don&#39;t exercise that much and I eat crap and smoke and bite my nails.</p><p>I retire with a smile on my face, in good health, and ready to spend autumns at my kids&#39; games instead of my own. I&#39;m excited to start the next chapter of my life.</p><p>The majority of Americans receive health insurance coverage through their employers, but with rising health care costs, many small businesses can no longer afford to provide coverage for their employees.</p><p>Skyrocketing insurance premiums are debilitating our Nation&#39;s health care delivery system and liability insurers are either leaving the market or raising rates to excessive levels.</p><p>In turn, more physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers are severely limiting their practices, moving to other states, or simply not providing care.</p><p>American families, families back home in Minnesota, know only too well that out-of-pocket expenses for health care have been rising at an astonishing rate.</p><p>America&#39;s veterans deserve the very best health care because they&#39;ve earned it.</p><p>The Recovery plan will put money in the pockets of the American worker, create and save millions of new jobs and invest in crucial areas such as health care, education, energy independence and a new infrastructure.</p><p>For those that are working part time, in small businesses, or who are unemployed and do not currently have health insurance, we want to make sure that you are covered.</p><p>One of the major goals of health insurance reform is to bring down the cost.</p><p>We want to make sure that we incentivize the health care system to be designed to provide you the best quality health care possible.</p><p>Please be assured that as we move along through the implementation of health insurance reform, making sure that we find efficiencies within the existing system, is foremost on the President&#39;s mind.</p><p>President Obama stands ready to work with everyone, because that&#39;s what the American people expect and deserve - not for the short term political advantages, but the long term health of our country. We don&#39;t spend time trying to figure out what&#39;s in the minds of Republicans, we try to keep our focus on the American people.</p><p>I turned into a workaholic to the point of where my health was in jeopardy.</p><p>Health care costs blunt the competitive edge of American entrepreneurs, from the auto industry to internet start-ups.</p><p>By giving every American access to quality, affordable health care, they will create a more competitive, a stronger and more secure America!</p><p>To do what we are doing in this budget to our children, cutting their health care funds, decreasing opportunity, simply so we can pay for tax cuts and a war in Iraq is beyond belief, and we need to reverse it.</p><p>I&#39;m committed to universal health coverage and education.</p><p>When you&#39;re young, you don&#39;t think very far ahead. You just think in terms of the next day, the next week, the next competition. You don&#39;t think about injuries that could threaten your long-term health.</p><p>I don&#39;t work out and be healthy and want a strong body because I want to look good in a bikini. I do all of those things for me and for my health. I&#39;m not going on the cover of &#39;Maxim&#39; and &#39;FHM&#39; because that&#39;s not me.</p><p>What you see is when the government gets involved, you run out of money and health care gets rationed.</p><p>If you can eat 70 percent raw or introduce raw into your diet, it will help your health.</p><p>We all recognize that in recent decades, many important achievements have helped create a cleaner, healthier environment, yet our national needs in environmental health are not being fully met.</p><p>America&#39;s health care system provides some of the finest doctors and more access to vital medications than any country in the world. And yet, our system has been faltering for many years with the increased cost of health care.</p><p>The lack of health care coverage has remained very important to me during my time in Congress and as a member of the House Subcommittee on Health, I am working hard with my colleagues to correct these inequalities.</p><p>The American economy has always been driven by the entrepreneurial nature of its citizens, and blocking access to affordable health care will only suffocate growth within the small business sector of our economy.</p><p>The World Health Organisation has a lot of its medical experts sitting in Geneva while hospitals in Africa have no drugs and desperate patients are forced to seek medication on the black market.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had any health problems and I&#39;m Ruben, man, all the way through.</p><p>I never want to try to be a spokesperson for health and wellness because I most definitely am not the most in shape person in the world.</p><p>Health and education are always issues.</p><p>Some of the best health care services are free or cost very little and are even available to millionaires but hardly anyone knows they exist.</p><p>There are few in America that really know how to take advantage of the current health care system.</p><p>Family, nature and health all go together.</p><p>When my friends have a health concern, they call me. I&#39;ve always been a vitamin taker. I also take digestive enzymes and antioxidants, and supplements that help with the thyroid and adrenals for my time-zone changes.</p><p>People really do make the assumption that I had some weirdo Hollywood upbringing, but my parents are incredibly down-to-earth people who worked really hard to raise us in a way that was health.</p><p>And whether it is equal pay, health care, Social Security, or family leave, this Congress has refused to address issues critical to hard-working American women.</p><p>Contraceptives have a proven track record of enhancing the health of women and children, preventing unintended pregnancy, and reducing the need for abortion.</p><p>For most women, including women who want to have children, contraception is not an option it is a basic health care necessity.</p><p>Half of all women who are sexually active, but do not want to get pregnant, need publicly funded services to help them access public health programs like Medicaid and Title X, the national family planning program.</p><p>I&#39;ve been working with the National Lung Health Education Program to raise awareness about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.</p><p>For example, lead paint in old houses can be a greater threat to children&#39;s health than lead that may be under some industrial site where there are no children.</p><p>For that story, I took as my subject a young woman whom I got to know over the course of a couple of visits.

That had a profound effect on me.</p><p>I don&#39;t think a director should have any kids. I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s good for your physical health. Even guys in their 30s look exhausted because directors never get enough sleep. What I do is stressful enough.</p><p>As I travel around Idaho and visit with seniors, I hear almost universal concern about the rising cost of health care, particularly the cost of prescription drugs.</p><p>We must take action now, by permitting re-importation, to ensure that health care and prescription drugs remain accessible and affordable for everyone.</p><p>While most Americans have access to the best oral health care in the world, low-income children suffer disproportionately from oral disease.</p><p>Recent demonstration projects have shown that with some Federal support, a little funding can go a long way toward ensuring that low-income children have access to good oral health care.</p><p>Fear is a question: What are you afraid of, and why? Just as the seed of health is in illness, because illness contains information, your fears are a treasure house of self-knowledge if you explore them.</p><p>In the midst of these hard times it is our good health and good sleep that are enjoyable.</p><p>Science is the international language, so when we are able to convince countries that good decision-making for human health and animal health is based upon science, that&#39;s a real success story for us.</p><p>I&#39;ve always believed fitness is an entry point to help you build that happier, healthier life.

Do you know what - private insurance is 30 percent in overhead and profits? Given a choice how I&#39;m going to improve health care, I&#39;m going to take it away from private insurance profits and overhead. Wouldn&#39;t you?</p><p>What I am saying is, all health care has a problem with costs. Medicare is growing slower than the private insurance plans. Why? Because of their efficiency. They don&#39;t have to give money to shareholders. Why should be defending shareholders?</p><p>Is Medicare socialism? You want to get rid of Medicare. And a lot of the people against health care do. I want to preserve it and grow it.</p><p>Optimism is not inherently a superior way of viewing the world. Certainly doctors will say it might be better for one&#39;s physical health to be an optimist. But, morally speaking it may not be appropriate in certain circumstances.</p><p>I believe we can incentivize more affordable health care in general by better regulating insurance and creating meaningful competition for health care services.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it should be a surprise when we&#39;re talking about energy and trying to have more home-grown energy, be less reliant on foreign oil when you look at our health care that we&#39;re trying to get more affordable health care, that these are going to create major debates in this country and be somewhat polarizing.</p><p>I would prefer a public option that would be a competitive option that would allow people to buy into a Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which is a series of private plans.</p><p>When Medicare was created for senior citizens and America &#39;s disabled in 1965, about half of a senior&#39;s health care spending was on doctors and the other half on hospitals.</p><p>I have a computer screen near my seat where I monitor the overall health of the vehicle and pick up any problems that might be occurring early on or once we see any kind of a malfunction or anything unusual that&#39;s happening, we can look at the data and figure out what that is.</p><p>Health care costs are eating the Defense Department alive.</p><p>Disease and ill health are caused largely by damage at the molecular and cellular level, yet today&#39;s surgical tools are too large to deal with that kind of problem.</p><p>I recently formed a foundation to raise awareness for prostate cancer.

Those were the only two jobs I ever had.</p><p>The people in Iraq lived essentially good lives. They had brilliant health and education systems.

Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which light bulbs to buy, and which will put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama&#39;s health care bill.</p><p>I&#39;m up here in Cleveland tonight and there are a lot of folks who are concerned about it. Twenty-five percent of the people up here get their health care through religious organizations and so that religious freedom issue is very important to them.</p><p>Americans oppose Obamacare because they understand that it is inconsistent with our liberties and our idea of limited government and that it will destroy the best health care system in the world.</p><p>And in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement: who knew that when asked, &#39;will government impose a new federal mandate requiring middle class Americans to buy health insurance whether they can afford it or not?&#39; The answer would be &#39;Yes we can!&#39;</p><p>The more you worry, the more you throw off the delicate balance of hormones required for health.</p><p>The truth is that stress doesn&#39;t come from your boss, your kids, your spouse, traffic jams, health challenges, or other circumstances.

Or, they used dangerous methods when they had no other recourse.

I am just glad to have been given the opportunity to do what I love most.</p><p>In choosing global corporate partners UNICEF emphasises compatibility with our core values and looks to build alliances that advance our mission of ensuring the health, education, equality and protection for all the world&#39;s children.</p><p>By offering individuals ownership and control of their health care coverage, we return control to the patients and that is exactly where it should be.</p><p>San Francisco businesses face many challenges, including high rents, regulatory burdens, and the rising cost of workers compensation insurance and employee health plans.</p><p>Not really in all honesty because until you take control of your own health and go to your own doctor and have your own doctor tell you what&#39;s going to work for you.</p><p>It is essential that the women&#39;s preventive coverage benefit, including contraception, be available to all women, regardless of what health plan they have or where they work - as Congress intended. Providing access to birth control just makes good sense.</p><p>It is important for women to have a choice, to have an opportunity to plan their families, because if they don&#39;t, the Republicans have said this is an ownership society. You are on your own, and they&#39;re going to begrudge that child everything, from WIC to a Pell Grant to health insurance.</p><p>Too many of my constituents, like many other hard working Americans across the country, are suffering unnecessarily due to our flawed health care system.</p><p>The time is now for Congress to address health care in America.</p><p>Our system of private health insurance that fails to provide coverage to so many of our citizens also contributes to the double-digit health care inflation that is making America less competitive in the global economy.</p><p>In this most powerful nation in the world, lack of access to health care should not force local and state governments, companies and workers into bankruptcy, while causing unnecessary illness and hospitalization.</p><p>All Americans should have access to quality, affordable health care.</p><p>Working families need to know that we will work to protect their health needs, promote the development of safe, effective medicines, and guarantee patient rights.</p><p>After I had gone through this matter with the President I told him of my condition of health and that my doctors felt that I must take a complete rest and that I thought that that meant leaving the Department finally in a short time.</p><p>I have long recognized a link between fitness and mental health and I think we need to encourage young people to take part in sports and team activities because we know it has such positive results.</p><p>We need a vibrant Medicaid program and strategies to expand affordable access to health care for all, especially for the specialty care services that community health centers do not provide.</p><p>In Illinois, community, migrant, homeless and public housing health centers operate 268 primary care sites and serve close to 1 million patients every year.</p><p>Each and every day health centers provide high-quality primary and preventive care to our constituents.</p><p>Community health centers do a great deal with limited resources. They provide critical medical care services to many who would otherwise have no other place to go or would end up in an emergency room.</p><p>As grateful as we are for all the work the community health centers do, it is also important that we recognize that they cannot solve the health care crisis facing our Nation by themselves.</p><p>Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are still in an age where individuals may be discriminated against because of health conditions.</p><p>Research clearly shows us that the earlier women think about maintaining their bone mass and take the steps to do so, the better their health will be in the long run.</p><p>I want to thank the efforts of the American Public Health Association and its 200-plus partners who have organized events around the Nation that serve to raise everyone&#39;s awareness of the need to improve public health.</p><p>It is great good health to believe, as the Hindus do, that there are 33 million gods and goddesses in the world.

It&#39;s a bigger picture.</p><p>We have one of the few societies, the only one I can think of right offhand, where your health care is so tied to your job, so that when an American company has to hire, they have to think about health care.</p><p>Health care for all Americans is the most pressing domestic issue today. It&#39;s far past time for the President and Congress to deliver health care to everyone.</p><p>Well, my view is that the insurance companies have done awfully well and spent a lot of money on a lot of things that don&#39;t have anything to do with health care.</p><p>Coal is absolutely critical to our nation&#39;s economic health and global competitiveness.</p><p>While some people are certainly seeing economic benefits, many others are unemployed, underemployed, without health insurance and struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>Jobs are disappearing from every sector of the economy, from engineering to health care workers, forcing hundreds of thousands of families into unemployment and low-paying jobs.</p><p>As state leaders, I think its important for us to provide our perspectives on issues we face every day - like access to school spending, access to health care and governing in a global economy.</p><p>The main thing is that it&#39;s nice to see these young people - 9 to 14 years old - take the opportunity to get more involved in their health and fitness.

It is the only art which can be practiced at any hour of the day or night, whenever the time and inclination comes, that is your time for reading in joy or sorrow, health or illness.</p><p>We can all agree that no American should lose their life savings or their home because of illness or injury and that the rising cost of health care severely burdens individuals, families and businesses.</p><p>At least Obama was half-way honest about how much he was going to spend on health care. He had it at $600 billion. And the real number... is $1.2 trillion.</p><p>As the GAO report recognizes, the long-term health of our forests relies on additional fuel reduction options and funding to reduce the risks that catastrophic fire poses to our nation&#39;s ecosystems, communities and federal budgetary resources.</p><p>And what we&#39;re doing in Ohio is we&#39;re moving from a basic manufacturing economy to one that&#39;s diversified, including energy and health care and agriculture and IT.</p><p>But, at the end of the day, we need to represent the taxpayers who have made enormous sacrifices. Many have lost their jobs. Many of them have seen their companies - they don&#39;t have a pension - they have seen their companies cut the match for their 401(k). They have seen their health care benefits be shredded.</p><p>In addition, California spends nearly $1 billion a year in Medi-Cal services for an average of 780,000 illegal immigrants a month, over and above emergency health services.</p><p>The biggest mistakes, early on, involved foreign policy and involved the strategy for health care.</p><p>On health care, virtually every political error that could be made was made.</p><p>My health is the No. 1 concern and my longevity is the No. 1 concern.</p><p>In some ways I&#39;m still recovering from the trial.

It would not be easy. I have worked with nutritionists who have said a vegan diet is not necessarily all positive for your health, because you need nutrients you only find in meats. I believe in a balanced diet.</p><p>Taste is developed by the diversity of the products one can sample. I think our children today may be missing an education about food. We must teach them to know their cuisine and to know the equilibrium of nourishment. That is very important for health.</p><p>Raising taxes is the last thing we should do amid the weakest economic recovery since World War II. Unfortunately, even if we avoid the full &#39;Taxmageddon&#39; scenario, President Obama&#39;s health care law also contains a new surtax on investment that will take effect in 2013.</p><p>By the Obama administration&#39;s reasoning, it would be constitutionally permissible to make Americans purchase nearly any product (broccoli, gym membership) that improved their health and thereby contributed to lower health-care costs.</p><p>Think for a moment about what Obamacare has done: The federal government has come up with its own (ever-evolving) definition of &#39;health insurance,&#39; which now includes free access to sterilization, contraception, and certain abortifacients such as the morning-after pill.</p><p>If Obamacare is allowed to stand - and Congress is allowed to make the purchase of government-endorsed health insurance compulsory - there will be no meaningful limit on Washington&#39;s reach into the lives of the American people.

Don&#39;t worry about your health care.</p><p>Every American has a right to affordable, high-quality health care.</p><p>Health reform is an essential part of restoring America&#39;s economy and maintaining our competitiveness.</p><p>But reducing harmful emissions, abating our dependence on foreign oil and developing alternative renewable energy sources have benefits that go beyond environmental health, they improve personal health, enhance national security and encourage our nation&#39;s economic viability.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies are enjoying unprecedented profits and access with this Administration. Yet the Republicans&#39; prescription drug plan for seniors has been a colossal failure, and over 43 million Americans wake up every morning without health insurance.</p><p>Democrats believe we must have comprehensive health care reform that includes giving the federal government authority to negotiate lower prices with drug companies.</p><p>People are at their happiest if they are true to themselves. I think that applies to their chosen profession, friends and relationships. It goes for your health too.

And within 20 minutes, I was being told by the director there that they didn&#39;t have what I needed there.</p><p>Irregular contact with doctors means many men fail to receive any preventive care for potentially life-threatening conditions. In addition, when men do seek care, embarrassment can often prevent them from openly discussing health concerns with their physicians.</p><p>This change to a higher phase of alert is a signal to governments, to ministries of health and other ministries, to the pharmaceutical industry and the business community that certain actions now should be undertaken with increased urgency and at an accelerated pace.</p><p>We have really good data that show when you take patients and you really inform them about their choices, patients make more frugal choices. They pick more efficient choices than the health care system does.</p><p>Paul Farmer has helped to build amazing health care system in one of the poorest areas of Haiti.

But, how can it be good for America if it raises taxes by a half trillion dollars and costs a trillion dollars or more to implement?</p><p>As problems like identity theft become more prevalent, now more than ever, Americans need to take their financial health seriously - and this information is of the utmost importance.</p><p>The people of South and Central Texas and the Coastal Bend need jobs, they need health care, they need water infrastructure improvements, they need a quality education, and they need the resources to keep our borders safe and secure.</p><p>Most Americans want health insurance.</p><p>I think the thing that the American people want is for the divisive debate on health care to stop.</p><p>If you have a student who graduates from college and they don&#39;t have a job, they are now able to stay on their family health plan.</p><p>If you look at the cost of providing health insurance, it actually doesn&#39;t cost more to provide a plan with contraceptive coverage than it does without.</p><p>I&#39;m a big proponent of having a mental health component go along with whatever the physical realities are.</p><p>My priority is to turn people - especially kids - on to sports and being active so they don&#39;t even have to think about it being good for their health. If people participate for the fun of it, and believe me - it is fun, then fitness programs will be much more successful.</p><p>We take our kids for physical vaccinations, dental exams, eye checkups.

And some of what they know about him complicates his task: Romney has a history of flip-flopping on issues, he&#39;s extraordinarily wealthy, and he can be tone-deaf about what moves voters. He just doesn&#39;t seem comfortable in his skin.</p><p>I normally ignore the History Channel.</p><p>Life moves fast.

I like natural history. The travel bit is not the important bit. The travel bit is what you have to do in order to go and look at animals.</p><p>In the old days... it was a basic, cardinal fact that producers didn&#39;t have opinions. When I was producing natural history programmes, I didn&#39;t use them as vehicles for my own opinion. They were factual programmes.</p><p>You can only get really unpopular decisions through if the electorate is convinced of the value of the environment. That&#39;s what natural history programmes should be for.</p><p>Cameramen are among the most extraordinarily able and competent people I know. They have to have an insight into natural history that gives them a sixth sense of what the creature is going to do, so they can be ready to follow.</p><p>The process of making natural history films is to try to prevent the animal knowing you are there, so you get glimpses of a non-human world, and that is a transporting thing.</p><p>Natural history is not about producing fables.</p><p>If I were beginning my career today, I don&#39;t think I would take the same direction.

They will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease, and will find themselves on the wrong side of history.</p><p>Well, the first thing is that truth and power for me form an antithesis, an antagonism, which will hardly ever be resolved.

I&#39;m interested in writing because one of those grandfathers wrote books.</p><p>From Jefferson to Jackson to Lincoln to FDR to Reagan, every great president inspires enormous affection and enormous hostility.

History is unmistakable on this point.</p><p>With the perspective afforded by the passage of time, where does 9/11 rank as a turning point in our national history? For the victims and their families, innocents going about their lives, suddenly and brutally murdered, no other day can ever matter as much.</p><p>I believe history will come to view 9/11 as an event on par with November 22, 1963, the date on which John F. Kennedy was murdered, cutting short a presidency that was growing ever more promising. Dreams died that day in Dallas it is easy to imagine the 1960s turning out rather differently had President Kennedy lived.</p><p>Religious belief, like history itself, is a story that is always unfolding, always subject to inquiry and ripe for questioning. For without doubt there is no faith.</p><p>History tells us that America does best when the private sector is energetic and entrepreneurial and the government is attentive and engaged. Who among us, really, would, looking back, wish to edit out either sphere at the entire expense of the other?</p><p>The past always seems somehow more golden, more serious, than the present. We tend to forget the partisanship of yesteryear, preferring to re-imagine our history as a sure and steady march toward greatness.</p><p>In retrospect, the Millennium marked only a moment in time. It was the events of September 11 that marked a turning point in history, where we confront the dangers of the future and assess the choices facing humankind.</p><p>The best history is but like the art of Rembrandt it casts a vivid light on certain selected causes, on those which were best and greatest it leaves all the rest in shadow and unseen.</p><p>It&#39;s not the sentiments of men which make history but their actions.</p><p>We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn&#39;t ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts.</p><p>Jews have a special relationship to books, and the Haggadah has been translated more widely, and reprinted more often, than any other Jewish book. It is not a work of history or philosophy, not a prayer book, user&#39;s manual, timeline, poem or palimpsest - and yet it is all these things.</p><p>There is at least one point in the history of any company when you have to change dramatically to rise to the next level of performance. Miss that moment - and you start to decline.</p><p>We also have to make sure our children know the history of women. Tell them the rotten truth: It wasn&#39;t always possible for women to become doctors or managers or insurance people. Let them be armed with a true picture of the way we want it to be.</p><p>I just think it would be unrealistic to suggest we&#39;re going to eliminate every last domestic insurgent in Afghanistan. Certainly, the history of the country would indicate that&#39;s not a very realistic objective, and I think we have to have realistic objectives.</p><p>Violence is a part of America. I don&#39;t want to single out rap music. Let&#39;s be honest. America&#39;s the most violent country in the history of the world, that&#39;s just the way it is. We&#39;re all affected by it.</p><p>As a state we are so uniquely positioned in so many ways.

It&#39;s about the Munich massacre and what Mossad did afterwards with the assassination squads. I think it&#39;s a turning point in history, especially for the Palestinians.</p><p>It&#39;s a huge challenge, a huge responsibility. Bond is a huge iconic figure in movie history. These opportunities don&#39;t come along very often so I thought, &#39;Why not?&#39;</p><p>But let me tell you, this gender thing is history. You&#39;re looking at a guy who sat down with Margaret Thatcher across the table and talked about serious issues.</p><p>History will point out some of the things I did wrong and some of the things I did right.</p><p>I have written too much history to have faith in it and if anyone thinks I&#39;m wrong, I am inclined to agree with him.</p><p>Permanent superiority has never been realized by any nation in history.

A country once known only from British consular reports and intrepid travelogues is now awash with historical documents, letters, diaries, grainy video, weblogs and secret police files of questionable authenticity.</p><p>Bulls don&#39;t read. Bears read financial history. As markets fall to bits, the bears dust off the Dutch tulip mania of 1637, the Banque Royale of 1719-20, the railway speculation of the 1840s, the great crash of 1929.</p><p>Cause and effect, the riddle of all history, is a particular devil in financial history and never more so than today, where entire classes of security are collapsing not on public exchanges and stock-tickers but because there are no markets to establish prices this side of nothing.</p><p>Nowhere else in history has there ever been a flag that stands for the right to burn itself. This is the fractal of our flag. It stands for the right to destroy itself.</p><p>Humanity has experienced many revolutionary changes over the course of history: revolutions in agriculture, in science, industrial production, as well as numerous political revolutions. But these have all been limited to the external aspects of our individual and collective lives.</p><p>We are not merely passive pawns of historical forces nor are we victims of the past.

He has suffered because his own children fell away from him. Ever since the Fall, God has been working tirelessly for the restoration of mankind. People do not know this brokenhearted aspect of God.</p><p>I don&#39;t see women and think of them as competition or with judgment. Women really move me. I feel connected to all kinds of women. I am angry because I think we&#39;ve been mistreated throughout history in different countries, including America. I admire women.</p><p>A year is an eternity in politics - though less than a moment in history.</p><p>We know from our own history that democratic institutions take decades to mature, and we know from past conflicts that freedom is not free.</p><p>The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history, like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past, the record of truths revealed by experience, is eminently practical, as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.</p><p>Some might think that George W.

It was on my mind when I was growing up.</p><p>From lies to forgeries the step is not so long, and I have written technical essays on the logic of forgeries and on the influence of forgeries on history.</p><p>Throughout out history, when people have looked for new ways to solve their problems, and to uphold the principles of this nation, many times they have turned to political parties.

Throughout human history, viral diseases have had their way with us, and for just as long, we have hunted them down and done our best to wipe them out.</p><p>War had always seemed to me to be a purely human behavior. Accounts of warlike behavior date back to the very first written records of human history it seemed to be an almost universal characteristic of human groups.</p><p>I think I was a good student, because I jumped over a school.

Whatever exists we believe can be changed for the better.</p><p>Natural selection, as it has operated in human history, favors not only the clever but the murderous.</p><p>When it went on the air, the sales department hated it.

But such institutions, at certain stages of history, perpetuate and produce such a deficit, and even threaten human survival.</p><p>The Deep South has a completely different history, both good and bad, that is fascinating for everybody. It makes people work together who usually don&#39;t, and that sounds like a cliche in so many ways, but it actually happened... and it happened because of a beautiful idea.</p><p>In my world, history comes down to language and art. No one cares much about what battles were fought, who won them and who lost them - unless there is a painting, a play, a song or a poem that speaks of the event.</p><p>In human history, the desire for revenge and the desire for loot have often been closely associated.</p><p>The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art&#39;s audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public.</p><p>Everything was going my way. I was happily marching into the history books. Then it all just fell apart.</p><p>If you read about Mussolini or Stalin or some of these other great monsters of history, they were at it all the time, that they were getting up in the morning very early. They were physically very active. They didn&#39;t eat lunch.</p><p>What you have now is a Hollywood that is pure poison. Hollywood was a central place in the history of art in the 20th century: it was human idealism preserved. And then, like any great place, it collapsed, and it collapsed into the most awful machinery in the world.</p><p>Our culture&#39;s obsession with vintage objects has rendered us unable to separate history from nostalgia.

The &#39;90s sucked, and the &#39;70s were just a sad, sad time in human history. Go 1980s! There&#39;s something that&#39;s just so cute about that time. And not just yellow nail polish and &#39;I&#39;m a loner.&#39;</p><p>If history, philosophy and so on vanish from academic life, what they leave in their wake may be a technical training facility or corporate research institute.

Society has always defended itself.</p><p>It is in Rousseau&#39;s writing above all that history begins to turn from upper-class honour to middle-class humanitarianism. Pity, sympathy and compassion lie at the centre of his moral vision. Values associated with the feminine begin to infiltrate social existence as a whole, rather than being confined to the domestic sphere.</p><p>Introspection and preserved writings give us far more insight into the ways of past humans than we have into the ways of past dinosaurs. For that reason, I&#39;m optimistic that we can eventually arrive at convincing explanations for these broadest patterns of human history.</p><p>Irish fiction is full of secrets, guilty pasts, divided identities. It is no wonder that there is such a rich tradition of Gothic writing in a nation so haunted by history.</p><p>Police departments no longer have to pay overtime or divert resources from other projects to find out where an individual goes - all they have to do is place a tracking device on someone&#39;s car or ask a cell phone company for that individual&#39;s location history and the technology does the work for them.</p><p>It is always self-defeating to pretend to a generation younger than your own it simply erases your own experience in history.</p><p>I&#39;ll watch any show on the History Channel.</p><p>Part of what I enjoy about the theatre and acting is that sense of history.</p><p>It took a while for me to grasp that my colleagues believe I have made an impact on the history of cinema.</p><p>Billions of people have seen and been influenced by movies in the short history of this industry.</p><p>Serbian history tells that the family is the most important thing and you have to stick with the family.</p><p>The history of our country is cruel.

We have to dig deeper and we have to do much more in order to be seen and to be spotted.</p><p>In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can&#39;t even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot, we said it means Hanson Is Murder. The name doesn&#39;t have a particular history. His Infernal Majesty was a totally different band. I think HIM derives from some death metal joke.</p><p>Given political history in Chile, it seemed to me that there was a critical task of consolidating a democracy and creating healthy civic-military and political-military relationships.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to get home from work and wonder if I could have done better if I didn&#39;t go out that night. What you&#39;re doing is going to go on the big screen and go down in history.</p><p>The Communist regime didn&#39;t consider this to be a shining moment in history and assigned no heroism to it. They classified it as merely an accident.</p><p>Everybody knows they&#39;re on the Obama team: There isn&#39;t vice presidential vs. presidential division, there&#39;s not a generational pull. People have internalized that this is a real moment in history.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to go negative on Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but he didn&#39;t pass an economic deal in the first 100 days.

He was a preacher, but he was also a history and political science teacher, and since he was my hero, I wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a teacher.</p><p>I don&#39;t have a long family history of good cooks in my family.</p><p>My mother, whom I love dearly, has continually revised my life story within the context of a complicated family history that includes more than the usual share of divorce, step-children, dysfunction, and obfuscation. I&#39;ve spent most of my adult life attempting to deconstruct that history and separate fact from fiction.</p><p>The UK is not going to leave the European Union. Of course not. We are inextricably wound up with Europe. In terms of culture, history and geography, we are a European nation.</p><p>In man - in the history of mankind, this has happened many times, and occupation leaders hang on to the land that they&#39;re occupying. People fight to liberate their land. But in the end, the people&#39;s will is what achieves victory.</p><p>The great drama of Russian history has been between its state and society. Put simply, Russia has always had too much state and not enough society.</p><p>Secretly, I&#39;m a real big nerd. I&#39;d rather stay home and play Scrabble than go to a Hollywood party, any day of the week. And I love reading about history and watching the Discovery Channel.</p><p>The whole history of civilization is strewn with creeds and institutions which were invaluable at first, and deadly afterwards.</p><p>More people have more access to more readers for less money than ever before in history. It means a lot of dross but it means a lot of very talented people can find and nurture a readership in ways that were not possible twenty years ago. From a creative perspective, that is all that writing is about.</p><p>Days&#39; has always been strong as an icon in TV history, and it&#39;s still going on strong and represents the genre of daytime drama so well. I&#39;m proud to be a part of it.;Alison Sweeney;history 34713;As a freelance writer, I&#39;d be asked to become an expert for various magazines on any subject, whether food or wine or history or the life span of veterinarians.

Then ask, &#39;Did this thing happen precisely this way?&#39; If the answer is yes, then it&#39;s history if the answer is no, not precisely this way, then it&#39;s historical drama.;Tony Kushner;history 34718;The general consensus among historians, among the ones who can handle the fact that &#39;Lincoln&#39; is, in fact, historical fiction, is that we demonstrate enormous fidelity to history and that, beyond that, we&#39;ve actually contributed a line of thinking about Lincoln&#39;s presidency that&#39;s somewhat original.;Tony Kushner;history 34719;A handful of works in history have had a direct impact on social policy: one or two works of Dickens, some of Zola, &#39;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&#39; and, in modern drama, Larry Kramer&#39;s &#39;The Normal Heart.</p><p>All the gossip and craziness becomes a kind of sustained narrative which, in turn, can become history.

But all the great change in history, positive change, was done by optimists.</p><p>History can never be covered up.</p><p>I&#39;ve always considered myself to be fiercely patriotic. I love Britain - its history and the down-to-earth attitude people have.</p><p>Each age tries to form its own conception of the past.

The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>I know that throughout their history, the people of the United States defended their freedom, their liberty, their justice, and their rights - if need be - with their lives. I think their courage is so admirable.</p><p>When history is erased, people&#39;s moral values are also erased.</p><p>From a reality perspective, I&#39;m sure part of that is true, but this is the largest blackout in U.S. history.

In fact, as of the writing of this column, millions of people along the Gulf Coast have been displaced from their homes in a period of only five days.</p><p>As a novelist, I mined my history, my family and my memory, but in a very specific way. Writing fiction, I never made use of experiences immediately as they happened. I needed to let things fester in my memory, mature and transmogrify into something meaningful.</p><p>Why shouldn&#39;t rap be esoteric, able to take in current events, history and criticism?

When you think back on the history of film and the 20th century, you see the propaganda that&#39;s been made.

But it sets a dangerous precedent to jail celebs just because someone hates them.</p><p>It would be incredibly presumptuous and self-serving of me to believe that Facebook was the end of history. The only way it could possibly be the end of history is if it becomes some sort of artificial super intelligence that takes over the world.</p><p>How do you make any sense of history, art or literature without knowing the stories and iconography of your own culture and all the world&#39;s main religions?</p><p>Nixon&#39;s full term was one of the most successful in U.S. history, which is why he was re-elected by the largest plurality in the country&#39;s history.</p><p>The issue of civil rights was too much for the establishment to handle.

To the good among his descendants home is paradise.</p><p>And when I was young, my family was perfectly nice. I write a lot about it, as you noticed. But it was rather limited.

How is he less than me?</p><p>Some men like a dull life - they like the routine of eating breakfast, going to work, coming home, petting the dog, watching TV, kissing the kids, and going to bed. Stay clear of it - it&#39;s often catching.</p><p>I learn something not because I have to, but because I really want to. That&#39;s the same view I have for performing. I&#39;m performing because I really want to, not because I have to bring bread back home.</p><p>I&#39;m the type of woman you might say is too good.
