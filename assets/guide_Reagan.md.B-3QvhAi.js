Generally speaking, children who lack parental support tend to have a low sense of self-worth, which hinders them from developing good character and achieving high achievements. This not only affects the children and their families, but is also detrimental to the country.</p><p>---005---</p><p>In the struggle between two different social systems, &quot;the ultimate decisive factor is not nuclear bombs and rockets, but a contest of wills and ideas.&quot;</p><p>---006---</p><p>Everyone should be responsible for his or her own failures. The structure of our society is interwoven with family, church, school, neighborhood, government, and entertainment venues. Among all the factors related to children&#39;s development, there is a role modeling, and the one who has the greatest influence on role modeling is parents.</p><p>---007---</p><p>Whatever I treasure and enjoy …</p><p>all would be without meaning</p><p>if I didn’t have you</p><p>Whatever I value and enjoy, it will be meaningless without you.</p><p>---008---</p><p>The most important finding of the survey is that the family does affect our social problems, that is, the general public&#39;s sense of right and wrong is confused. The best way to establish a sense of right and wrong in life is for parents to set an example in their daily lives. Therefore, as parents who educate their children, we must carefully examine our own behavior.</p><p>---009---</p><p>&quot;We are building a nation that is once again active, strong, and vibrant.
