The camera captures all moods and nuances; immortalizes the soft and silky continuum that is humanity. Those still life moments seem so fluid, so representative of continuity. They are a single moment captured, yet an eternity expressed. All your youth; all your ages, captured and expressed in a single click. Of all the indulgences, vanity is certainly my favorite which we should otherwise resist, but are inexplicably captivated by and addicted. What other animal would spend so much time pouting and preening for its reflection? Only humanity would participate in such self-adoration. You would think we have the most colorful feathers or softest of manes. Rather, we are a naked biped that feels incomplete without some decorative element, accessory, or embellishment of the self. We are intoxicated by the image of the body, no different than we are seduced by fine wines, foods, or mind altering elements. We devour the skin, and peel away clothes as if they were the skin of some tropical fruit, covering a colorful and juicy interior. We hunt for bodily pleasures, and collect them as prizes; show them off in social situations as if our companions were some sort of extended adornment to ourselves. We are revealed in our sensuality. To touch beneath the surface; to connect beyond facades, that unattainable discourse between individuals is put tentatively within reach in intimacy. To capture those moments is to capture the essence of what makes us human, and what ultimately sets us above and aside from the rest of nature. Capturing humanity in its most extravagant expressions is intoxicating. Vanity is by far my favorite sin, and it is an endless tale as infinite as humanity. Every person is but a stitch in a giant tapestry.","author":"A.E.

The double doors buzzed open and we walked in. A handsome man and his lover in an orange top snuggled as they walked to the exit. Veronica turned to me and smiled, taking my hand. I unbuttoned my shirt at the neck and exposed my collar. It was a thin metal collar with a padlock on the front. If the padlock wasnt attached it would have looked like any other interesting necklace that was tight against my neck, but it got more interesting with the padlock. \\tOn Veronicas left hand there was a thick bracelet, and that had a key on it. Her right wrist had a glow bracelet. We walked past the tables of people as they drank and screamed over the music to talk. We decided to go right to the dance floor. She took me by the hand, led me.\\tWe were on the dance floor and I couldnt dance. I ended up just throwing myself around, getting lost in the people surrounding us. The bodies pressed against us, the industrial music loud and crisp. The bass shook your bones, and my ribcage felt like it was rattled to pieces. I closed my eyes and just moved. Veronica moved with a grace I hadnt seen in awhile when I opened my eyes. She pressed herself against a couple that surrounded her. I felt my breath catch in my throat, my heart pounded from excitement. She squeezed past them and moved to me, her hands ran down my face, and then she gripped the padlock with her left hand.\\tShe pulled me down to her, which wasnt very far, but it was the intensity of the moment that made all the difference. What she did next made me jump, my body tensed and relaxed in milliseconds. She gave me a deep kiss, and, while she kissed me, distracted me, her other hand undid my padlock. I pulled back as I jumped in shock. Our eyes were locked on each others in the flashing neon stage lights.

The pheromones of the big cat mingled with the pine and I spun around. I was smelling and looking for the flash of white, but I couldnt see it. I grew angry and I pawed at the earth. The aroma of the soil cleansed my nose as I leaned down and sniffed deeply. I slowly closed and opened my eyes. As I looked ahead I saw something. \\tThere, further on, I had another glimpse of the large white cat. She was stopped and her hindquarters were in the air. I stared, trying to figure out what she was doing. Her forepaws and head were on the ground, but her hind was wiggling. She was next to a tree, marking it, so I slowly paced in a zigzag pattern as I walked close to her. I was being cautious because poachers had been known to employ shifters to entice real animals in the wild. She turned her head and growled at me. I took it as an invite to come closer. I ran up to her and started circling. She was an albino panther as I thought. I paced closer, breathing deep. I was in the middle of Ohio, outside of a lost cougar and a few bobcats there were no big cats here, at least not counting lycanthropes, and this creature didnt smell like one of those. Her rump almost wagged in anticipation, and I felt my tiger body respond.\\tI circled her, taking a swipe in her direction to see if she was going to respond negatively to me. The pink eyes followed me and she growled. I walked up to her, sniffed her face and neckline. I didnt smell any other male on her, and I walked to her raised rump. Burying my nose in her groin I smelled deeper, and she shifted her body. \\tI felt it before I could see it. She was shifting, changing from albino panther to human. I sat on my hindquarters as I watched. Her white fur seemed to melt from her, sliding upwards, starting with her back legs. The flesh and fur on her feet slid forward, leaving human feet and calves. It was fully fleshed, unlike some lycanthrope changes when theyre younger. The calves of her legs appeared, and slowly slid up. The panther flesh was sliding forward, slowly and methodically. Across her ass and groin, now lower back and stomach. The pheromones I smelled earlier were coming from her, the human form. I stood and started pacing behind her, and her panther head shook in a very human gesture. I stopped, fighting the desire to lean forward and lick her wetness with my large tongue. The flesh was sliding forward and as her teats turned into breasts, I growled in need. Next were her shoulders and arms, then her head and hands. As the transformation ended, there was a pile of fur and flesh lying in front of her. Her human form was beautiful; a full figured woman with long white hair, that was perfectly natural. She looked to be in her early forties, but didnt have a line on her face that she didnt want. In the corners of her eyes were small, but beautiful, crows feet, laugh lines surrounded her mouth. She laid out with her former form under her, laying on it, propped up by her elbows. She smiled with the confidence of someone who was used to being in charge. Her long hair flowed around her shoulders, framing her body. She reminded me of someone, but I couldnt figure out who.","author":"Todd Misura, Divergence: Erotica from a Different Angle","category":"erotica, werecats, woods"},{"quote":"Love is possession, a sort of vanity.","author":"Chloe Thurlow, Katie in Love","category":"erotica, love"},{"quote":"There is a kind of truth in a well-told lie.

My voice quivers in fear- hell, yeah Im afraid of Master Ez.The office doesnt get a second of my notice. Master Ez sits at his desk. He doesnt get up. He smirks at me lasciviously. His steel eyes glow in the dim room. He commands me to look at him and I cant stop.I ask the questions, Regina. The cadence is smooth, but there is an undercurrent of threat.He called me Regina, only Ezra calls me Regina. The one that was upset when I fled to the bathroom is the childlike Ezra- he probably would call me Regina, too. Master Ez calls me Queen. The true Ezra is a combination of both- an integrated personality. Hes the one talking to me. Why is HE looking at me like that?I dont understand that look, Ezra, I mumble.As Ive said over and over, we are one in the same- Master Ez and I. He sighs like he gets sick of pointing out that fact.Um- yeah but Master Ez loves ladies and theyre missing an appendage for you to enjoy, I tease because anything else would scare the shit out of me.Regina, Regina, he laughs. The Ezra I used to be liked boys. That changed- quickly and against my will. Master Ez only likes girls. Doesnt it seem likely that if who I used to be liked boys and who manifested liked woman, that perhaps I enjoy both now? If we are to cohabitate in peace, we have certain concessions to make.","author":"Erica Chilson, Checkmate","category":"bsdm, erotica"},{"quote":"God, he was an evil bastard, but boy was he good!","author":"MFR, Forbidden Fantasies","category":"bdsm, bondage, domination, erotic-fiction, erotic-short-stories, erotica, sex, sexual, submission"},{"quote":"You know what I want?

Sirien, a young girl from northern Thailand, falls hopelessly in love with Bob, an American student who winds up in the massage parlor by accident, dragged there by his buddies after a fatefully boozy evening. Bob doesn't touch her, he's happy just to look at her with his lovely, pale-blue eyes and tell her about his hometown - in North Carolina, or somewhere like that. They see each other several more times, whenever Sirien isn't working, but, sadly, Bob must leave to finish his senior year at Yale. Ellipsis. Sirien waits expectantly while continuing to satisfy the needs of her numerous clients. Though pure at heart, she fervently jerks off and sucks paunchy, mustached Frenchmen (supporting role for Gerard Jugnot), corpulent, bald Germans (supporting role for some German actor). Finally, Bob returns and tries to free her from her hell - but the Chinese mafia doesn't see things in quite the same light. Bob persuades the American ambassador and the president of some humanitarian organization opposed to the exploitation of young girls to intervene (supporting role for Jane Fonda). What with the Chinese mafia (hint at the Triads) and the collusion of Thai generals (political angle, appeal to democratic values), there would be a lot of fight scenes and chase sequences through the streets of Bangkok. At the end of the day, Bob carries her off. But in the penultimate scene, Sirien gives, for the first time, an honest account of the extent of her sexual experience. All the cocks she has sucked as a humble massage parlor employee, she has sucked in the anticipation, in the hope of sucking Bob's cock, into which all the others were subsumed - well, I'd have to work on the dialogue.

Delaney, The Girl Before","category":"conflicting-accounts, different-perspectives, emma-matthews, j-p-delaney, personality, the-girl-before"},{"quote":"I've thought about that often since. I mean, about the word nice. Perhaps I mean good. Of course they mean nothing, when you start to think about them. A good man, one says; a good woman; a nice man, a nice woman. Only in talk of course, these are not words you'd use in a novel. I'd be careful not to use them.Yet of that group, I will say simply, without further analysis, that George was a good person, and that Willi was not. That Maryrose and Jimmy and Ted and Johnnie the pianist were good people, and that Paul and Stanley Lett were not. And furthermore, I'd bet that ten people picked at random off the street to meet them, or invited to sit in that party under the eucalyptus trees that night, would instantly agree with this classification-would, if I used the word good, simply like that, know what I meant.And thinking about this, which I have done so much, I discover that I come around, by a back door, to another of the things that obsess me. I mean, of course, this question of 'personality.' Heaven knows we are never allowed to forget that the 'personality' doesn't exist any more. It's the theme of half the novels written, the theme of the sociologists and all the other -ologists. We're told so often that human personality has disintegrated into nothing under pressure of all our knowledge that I've even been believing it. Yet when I look back to that group under the trees, and re-create them in my memory,suddenly I know it's nonsense. Suppose I were to meet Maryrose now, all these years later,she'd make some gesture, or turn her eyes in such a way, and there she'd be, Maryrose, and indestructible. Or suppose she 'broke down,' or became mad. She would break down into her components, and the gesture, the movement of the eyes would remain, even though some connection had gone. And so all this talk, this antihumanist bullying, about the evaporation of the personality becomes meaningless for me at that point when I manufacture enough emotional energy inside myself to create in memory some human being I've known. I sit down, and remember the smell of the dust and the moonlight, and see Ted handing a glass of wine to George, and George's over-grateful response to the gesture. Or I see, as in a slow-motion film, Maryrose turn her head, with her terrifyingly patient smile... I've written the word film. Yes. The moments I remember all have the absolute assurance of a smile, a look, a gesture, in a painting or a film. Am I saying then that the certainty I'm clinging to belongs to the visual arts, and not to the novel, not to the novel at all, which has been claimed by the disintegration and the collapse? What business has a novelist to cling to the memory of a smile or a look, knowing I so well the complexities behind them? Yet if I did not, I'd never be able to set a word down on paper; just as I used to keep myself from going crazy in this cold northern city by deliberately making myself remember the quality of hot sunlight on my skin.And so I'll write again that George was a good man.","author":"Doris Lessing, The Golden Notebook","category":"goodness, novels, personality"},{"quote":"Being selfless isn't bad.

Writing saved my life. Writing has been my window -- flung wide open to this magnificent, chaotic existence -- my way of interpreting everything within my grasp. Writing has extended that grasp by pushing me beyond comfort, beyond safety, past my self-perceived limits. It has softened my heart and hardened my intellect. It has been a privilege. It has whipped my ass. It has burned into me a valuable clarity. It has made me think about suffering, randomness, good will, luck, memory responsibility, and kindness, on a daily basis -- whether I feel like it or not. It has insisted that I grow up. That I evolve. It has pushed me to get better, to be better. It is my disease and my cure. It has allowed me not only to withstand the losses in my life but to alter those losses -- to chip away at my own bewilderment until I find the pattern in it. Once in a great while, I look up at the sky and think that, if my father were alive, maybe he would be proud of me.

Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.-The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications.

Loving someone who doesnt love you back. Wanting to kiss them when they dont. Be someone else while they make you be who you are without effort? Being so at ease that it seems like youve known each other for years, even though you never spoke to them, or didnt speak to them for years?Love is a rare thing. The other person cant be forced to love you. Cant make themselves love you, even though they want to, or not.If you ask me, love is something magical. Something totally unknown to human beings. Tell me, is there anyone out there that completely understands love? No, because human beings cant fully understand something that cant be understood. Love is a feeling, its not a thing, its not something that can be explained. Every soul on this earth experiences love in a million different ways. No love is the same, it never will be. No day loving the same person is the same. No day loving someone else is the same.When you love someone, fight. But make sure you lose the fight when it leads to heartache. Because losing that fight will be more rewarding then to keep on fighting for something that can never win. Never lose a fight before it has even started.","author":"Kim Pape","category":"love, love-quotes-and-sayings"},{"quote":"My heart is your home.","author":"Sir Kristian Goldmund Aumann","category":"heart-quote, love-quotes-and-sayings"},{"quote":"Listen, I do care about you.If that time ever comes, when I say \\"I don't care\\", trust me, in that moment, I will be lying.","author":"Hafsa Shah","category":"caring, caring-for-others, caring-quotes, love, love-quotes-and-sayings"},{"quote":"I was so desperate to be loved that when he made me feel special, I made him my world","author":"dandelionlady96","category":"love, love-quotes-and-sayings"},{"quote":"Love is an eternal shining star.","author":"Sir Kristian Goldmund Aumann","category":"love-quotes-and-sayings, shining-star"},{"quote":"Itsumademo ai shiteru, Yuki.

Not a very subtle one, I know. Hey Gianni, how you doing, huh? Wow, youre sure getting big, Colin remarked. He sure is. Hes almost standing all by himself now, arent you, Gianni? You wanna show Colin? Bree asked. Nooo, Gianni insisted, burying his face in Brees neck. Oh, speaking of Mr. Cranky Pants, huh? He didnt get a lot of sleep last night. Gianni lifted his head and then looked down, and it was then that Bree noticed Colin still had his hand on her arm. Dat, Gianni said.

Brianna put every other woman in New York to shame. No woman could come near her beauty, her passion, her fire. Colin had tossed her aside for the angelic Carrie and now he was changing his mind. Oh no you dont, you miserable fucker. Her friend indeed, Bernardo drawled, his Italian accent thick with unmistakable implication. Dats da truth. He no make her cry all da time. That was directed at Alessandro, with small dark accusatory eyes. He nice. Alessandro couldnt look at those eyes without feeling a sickening pang of guilt. Shes mine! He wanted to scream. Mine! Mine! Mine! Oh yes. Very nice. He was very nice when he held her at the cemetery and very nice when he was dancing with her at Adresca. That made Alessandros head lift in surprise. Oh yes, my boy. Shes been there, cleaning up the rubble and word is that shes working on re-opening it. Her friend Colin has been quite helpful in that endeavour. I don like how you say dat, Will said scowling. Really young William, I only speak the truth, Bernardo taunted. Alessandros mind was racing. NO! Not Colin. He could not let that imbecile take Brianna away from him. Hed have to be eliminated somehow. Alessandro began to plot all the different ways he could ensure that Colin Neally stayed away from his wife, permanently. They all involved grisly, violent methods.

Its not a physical thing that I can explain to you, but itslikeI dont know, Alessandro said shrugging and lowering his head. He sat on the bed next to her and stared at the incubator. The babys eyes were open, staring back, blinking slowly, sleepily. Youre seeing him become a person. Like all the parts of him are coming together and making this tiny persons soul. He was one person in here, Bree pointed to her stomach. And now hes changing on the outside so he can be a part of the world. Thats it, Alessandro nodded. Hes a part of the world now. My world, in a completely different way than when he was inside of you. Its like having two sons and watching them become one as a slow minute by minute process. Hes never going to stop changing. What he thinks and feels now is not going to be what he thinks and feels tomorrow or fifty years from now. Its the same for you, Bree said, closing her fingers over his on the bed.

Im entering my eighth month here. I must say, Im surprised youre so anxious to leave. Why? Bree asked, turning to look at his strong profile. You know why, Brianna.

Is it a doctrine formulated by aristocrats and philosophers arguing that there is some unseen driving force predicting the outcomes of every minuscule and life altering moment in one's life? Or is it the artistry illustrated by those under-qualifed and over-eager to give their future meaning and their ambitions hope? Is it a declaration by those who refuse to accept that we are alone in this universe, spinning randomly through a matrix of accidental coincidences? Or is it the assumptions made by those who concede that there is a divine plan or pre-ordained path for each human being,regardless of their current station?I think destiny is a bit of a tease....It's syndical taunts and teases mock those naive enough to believe in its black jack dealing of inevitable futures. Its evolution from puppy dogs and ice cream to razor blades and broken mirrors characterizes the fickle nature of its sordid underbelly. Those relying on its decisive measures will fracture under its harsh rules. Those embracing the fact that life happens at a million miles a minute will flourish in its random grace.Destiny has afforded me the most magical memories and unbelievably tragic experiences that have molded and shaped my life into what it is today...beautiful.I fully accept the mirage that destiny promises and the reality it can produce.

Nor was it policy to prosecute defense witnesses who were demonstrably lying--by providing false alibis, for example--because, as another ADA told me, if they win the case, they don't bother, and if they lose, \\"it looks like sour grapes.\\" A cop told me about a brawl at court one day, when he saw court officers tackle a man who tried to escape from the Grand Jury. An undercover was testifying about a buy when the juror recognized him as someone he had sold to. Another cop told me about locking up a woman for buying crack, who begged for a Desk Appearance Ticket, because she had to get back to court, for jury duty--she was the forewoman on a Narcotics case, of course. The worst part about these stories is that when I told them to various ADAs, none were at all surprised; most of those I'd worked with I respected, but the institutionalized expectations were abysmal. They were too used to losing and it showed in how they played the game.","author":"Edward Conlon, Blue Blood","category":"cops, district-attorney, irony, jurors, jury-duty, pathetic, police, the-system, voir-dire"},{"quote":"Scary discovery of the day: Most people who RT @yokoono's tweets do so without irony.","author":"James Taranto","category":"2011, irony, twitter, yoko-ono"},{"quote":"They had supported him ... for freedom's sake, they would have said; meaning as do all men who mouth that catchword, freedom for themselves and their own class.","author":"Margaret Butler, The Lion of England","category":"irony, social-issues"},{"quote":"If we chose to refuse irony, we risk becoming irony's dupe.","author":"Janet Beizer","category":"irony"},{"quote":"Now it turns out that a few broadsheet film critics in Britain do indeed belong to a category of people who would have resisted Hitler when he came to power.

Rather, the ironist's cage is a state of irony by way of powerlessness and inactivity: In a world where terrorism makes cultural relativism harder and harder to defend against its critics, marauding international corporations follow fair-trade practices, increasing right-wing demagoguery and violence can't be answered in kind, and the first black U.S. president turns out to lean right of center, the intelligentsia can see no clear path of action. Irony dominates as a \\"mockery of the promise and fitness of things,\\" to return to the OED definition of irony.This thinking is appropriate to Wes Anderson, whose central characters are so deeply locked in ironist cages that his films become two-hour documents of them rattling their ironist bars. Without the irony dilemma Roth describes, we would find it hard to explain figures like Max Fischer, Steve Zissou, Royal Tenenbaum, Mr. Fox, and Peter Whitman. I'm not speaking here of specific political beliefs. The characters in question aren't liberals; they may in fact, along with Anderson himself, have no particular political or philosophical interests. But they are certainly involved in a frustrated and digressive kind of irony that suggests a certain political situation. Though intensely self-absorbed and central to their films, Anderson's protagonists are neither heroes nor antiheroes. These characters are not lovable eccentrics. They are not flawed protagonists either, but are driven at least as much by their unsavory characteristics as by any moral sense. They aren't flawed figures who try to do the right thing; they don't necessarily learn from their mistakes; and we aren't asked to like them in spite of their obvious faults. Though they usually aren't interested in making good, they do set themselves some kind of mission--Anderson's films are mostly quest movies in an age that no longer believes in quests, and this gives them both an old-fashioned flavor and an air of disillusionment and futility.","author":"Arved Mark Ashby, Popular Music and the New Auteur: Visionary Filmmakers After MTV","category":"disillusionment, fantastic-mr-fox, film-criticism, ironist, irony, pomo, postmodernism, rushmore, the-royal-tenenbaums, wes-anderson"},{"quote":"Everyone Deserves An Equal Footing.","author":"R.E.

If ever there was a critic of the fetishizing effect of fascinating and dazzling \\"leitmotifs\\", it is Adorno: in his devastating analysis of Wagner, he tries to demonstrate how Wagnerian leitmotifs serve as fetishized elements of easy recognition and thus constitute a kind of inner-structural commodification of his music. It is then a supreme irony that traces of this same fetishizing procedure can be found in Adorno's own writings. Many of his provocative one-liners do effectively capture a profound insight or at least touch on a crucial point (for example: \\"Nothing is more true in pscyhoanalysis than its exaggeration\\"); however, more often than his partisans are ready to admit, Adorno gets caught up in his own game, infatuated with his own ability to produce dazzlingly \\"effective\\" paradoxical aphorisms at the expense of theoretical substance (recall the famous line from Dialectic of Englightment on how Hollywood's ideological maniuplation of social reality realized Kant's idea of the transcendental constitution of reality). In such cases where the dazzling \\"effect\\" of the unexpected short-circuit (here between Hollywood cinema and Kantian ontology) effectively overshadows the theoretical line of argumentation, the brilliant paradox works precisely in the same manner as the Wagnerian leitmotif: instead of serving as a nodal point in the complex network of structural mediation, it generates idiotic pleasure by focusing attention on itself. This unintended self-reflexivity is something of which Adorno undoubtedly was not aware: his critique of the Wagnerian leitmotif was an allegorical critique of his own writing. Is this not an exemplary case of his unconscious reflexivity of thinking? When criticizing his opponent Wagner, Adorno effectively deploys a critical allegory of his own writing - in Hegelese, the truth of his relation to the Other is a self-relation.","author":"Slavoj ?i?ek, Living in the End Times","category":"irony, self-consciousness"},{"quote":"So we came to say hello.

It should be remembered, though, that even when Fukuyama advanced it, the idea that history had reached a terminal beach was not merely triumphalist. Fukuyama warned that his radiant city would be haunted, but he thought its specters would be Nietzschean rather than Marxian. Some of Nietzsches most prescient pages are those in which he describes the oversaturation of an age with history. It leads an age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself, he wrote in Untimely Meditations, and subsequently into the even more dangerous mood of cynicism, in which cosmopolitan fingering, a detached spectatorialism, replaces engagement and involvement. This is the condition of Nietzsches Last Man, who has seen everything, but is decadently enfeebled precisely by this excess of (self) awareness.","author":"Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?","category":"cynicism, end-of-history, fukuyama, history, irony, last-man, nietzsche, postmodernism, postmodernity"},{"quote":"I got mixed up with some oddness in my youth, and the long and short of it is that I can't shuffle off this mortal coil until I have read the ten most boring classics.","author":"Jasper Fforde, Lost in a Good Book","category":"boring-books, funny, irony"},{"quote":"She talks about how she can't exercise because of the ailments-a bad back, sore knees, breathing difficulties-all caused by her weight gain.","author":"A.S.

And meanwhile all sorts of worthless fellows far inferior to me knew how to behave with wonderful aplomb-- and that's what really exasperated me above everything, so that I lost my self-possession more and more.

Doubt is useful in small amounts, but too much of it leads to apathy and confusion. No, don't doubt everything. QUESTION everything. That's the real trick. Doubt is just a lack of certainty. If you doubt everything, you'll doubt evolution, science, faith, morality, even reality itself - and you'll end up with nothing, because doubt doesn't give anything back. But questions have answers, you see. If you question everything, you'll find that a lot of what we believe is untrue...but you might also discover that some things ARE true. You might discover what your own beliefs are. And then you'll question them again, and again, eliminating flaws, discovering lies, until you get as close to the truth as you can.Questioning is a lifelong process. That's precisely what makes it so unlike doubt. Questioning engages with reality, interrogating all it sees. Questioning leads to a constant assault on the intellectual status quo, where doubt is far more likely to lead to resigned acceptance. After all, when the possibility of truth is doubtful (excuse the pun), why not simply play along with the most convenient lie?Questioning is progress, but doubt is stagnation.","author":"Tom Jubert / Jonas Kyratzes","category":"doubt, questioning, the-talos-principle"},{"quote":"Dont be tossed away by your monkey mind.

For if truth were on the side of doubt, the individual who doubted would be superior not only to these spokesmen, who have not doubted, but also to the majority of normal men across the millennia of human existence.

Its value depends on what you do with it. You can doubt whats real in order to stay asleep or you can doubt your daydreams in order to wake up. You can use doubt to protect you from the truth or you can use doubt to leave you vulnerable to it. Youll have doubts regardless. Repurpose them for the sake of faith. Saving doubt is a strong solvent that can burn holes in your [worldview] and lead you back to the work of being faithful to life and, thus, to God.

So our heart had to be broken in two so that Scarlett could be born first, and then I finally braved the outside world a few years later. It made sense, in our pig-tailed heads--it explained why, when we ran through grass or danced or spun in circle long enough, we would lose track of who was who and it started to feel as if there were some organic, elegant link between us, our single heart holding the same tempo and pumping the same blood. That was before the attack, though. Now our hearts link only when we're hunting, when Scarlett looks at me with a sort of beautiful excitement that's more powerful than her scars and then tears after a Fenris as though her life depends on its death.

As she greeted me, I could sense the pain behind her polite and superficial smile. She started telling me her story, and within one second her smile changed into a grimace of pain. Then, she began to sob uncontrollably. She said she felt lonely and unfulfilled. There was much anger and sadness. As a child she had been abused by a physically violent father. I saw quickly that her pain was not caused by her present life circumstances but by an extraordinarily heavy pain-body. Her pain-body had become the filter through which she viewed her life situation. She was not yet able to see the link between the emotional pain and her thoughts, being completely identified with both. She could not yet see that she was feeding the pain-body with her thoughts. In other words, she lived with the burden of a deeply unhappy self. At some level, however, she must have realized that her pain originated within herself, that she was a burden to herself. She was ready to awaken, and this is why she had come. I directed the focus of her attention to what she was feeling inside her body and asked her to sense the emotion directly, instead of through the filter of her unhappy thoughts, her unhappy story. She said she had come expecting me to show her the way out of her unhappiness, not into it. Reluctantly, however, she did what I asked her to do. Tears were rolling down her face, her whole body was shaking. At this moment, this is what you feel. I said. There is nothing you can do about the fact that at this moment this is what you feel. Now, instead of wanting this moment to be different from the way it is, which adds more pain to the pain that is already there, is it possible for you to completely accept that this is what you feel right now? She was quiet for a moment. Suddenly she looked impatient, as if she was about to get up, and said angrily, No, I don't want to accept this. Who is speaking? I asked her. You or the unhappiness in you? Can you see that your unhappiness about being unhappy is just another layer of unhappiness? She became quiet again. I am not asking you to do anything. All I'm asking is that you find out whether it is possible for you to allow those feelings to be there. In other words, and this may sound strange, if you don't mind being unhappy, what happens to the unhappiness? Don't you want to find out? She looked puzzled briefly, and after a minute or so of sitting silently, I suddenly noticed a significant shift in her energy field. She said, This is weird. I 'm still unhappy, but now there is space around it. It seems to matter less.This was the first time I heard somebody put it like that: There is space around my unhappiness. That space, of course, comes when there is inner acceptance of whatever you are experiencing in the present moment.I didn't say much else, allowing her to be with the experience. Later she came to understand that the moment she stopped identifying with the feeling, the old painful emotion that lived in her, the moment she put her attention on it directly without trying to resist it, it could no longer control her thinking and so become mixed up with a mentally constructed story called The Unhappy Me. Another dimension had come into her life that transcended her personal past C the dimension of Presence. Since you cannot be unhappy without an unhappy story, this was the end of her unhappiness. It was also the beginning of the end of her pain-body. Emotion in itself is not unhappiness. Only emotion plus an unhappy story is unhappiness. When our session came to an end, it was fulfilling to know that I had just witnessed the arising of Presence in another human being. The very reason for our existence in human form is to bring that dimension of consciousness into this world. I had also witnessed a diminishment of the pain-body, not through fighting it but through bringing the light of consciousness to it.","author":"Eckhart Tolle, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose","category":"inspirational, life-changing"},{"quote":"Some mistakes... just have greater consequences than others.

According to his own reluctant account, he came this close to going up a smokestack of a crematorium there: \\"I had just been assigned to the Sonderkommando,\\" he said to me, \\"when the order came from Himmler to close the ovens down.\\" Sonderkommando means special detail. At Auschwitz it meant a very special detail indeed--one composed of prisoners whose duties were to shepherd condemned persons into gas chambers, and then to lug their bodies out. When the job was done, the members of the Sonderkommando were themselves killed. The first duty of their successors was to dispose of their remains. Gutman told me that many men actually volunteered for the Sonderkommando. \\"Why?\\" I asked him. \\"If you would write a book about that,\\" he said, \\"and give the answer to that question, that 'Why?'--you would have a very great book.\\" \\"Do you know the answer?\\" I said. \\"No,\\" he said, \\"That is why I would pay a great deal of money for a book with the answer in it.\\" \\"Any guesses?\\" I said. \\"No,\\" he said, looking me straight in the eye, \\"even though I was one of the ones who volunteered.\\"He went away for a little while, after having confessed that. And he thought about Auschwitz, the thing he liked least to think about. And he came back, and he said to me: \\"There were loudspeakers all over the camp,\\" he said, \\"and they were never silent for long. There was much music played through them. Those who were musical told me it was often good music--sometimes the best.\\" \\"That's interesting,\\" I said. \\"There was no music by Jews,\\" he said. \\"That was forbidden.\\" \\"Naturally,\\" I said. \\"And the music was always stopping in the middle,\\" he said, \\"and then there was an announcement. All day long, music and announcements.\\" \\"Very modern,\\" I said. He closed his eyes, remembered gropingly. \\"There was one announcement that was always crooned, like a nursery rhyme. Many times a day it came. It was the call for the Sonderkommando.\\" \\"Oh?\\" I said. \\"Leichent?rger zu Wache,\\" he crooned, his eyes still closed. Translation: \\"Corpse-carriers to the guardhouse.\\"In an institution in which the purpose was to kill human beings by the millions, it was an understandably common cry. \\"After two years of hearing that call over the loudspeakers, between the music,\\" Gutman said to me, \\"the position of corpse-carrier suddenly sounded like a very good job.","author":"Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Mother Night","category":"life-changing, life-lessons, war"},{"quote":"Fate seems to be taking me in some even stranger directions.","author":"Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore","category":"inspirational, life, life-changing, personal"},{"quote":"That was the problem these days--everything was considered disposable--clothes, cell phones, relationships.","author":"Melissa de la Cruz, Sun-Kissed","category":"disposable, life-changing, relationships"},{"quote":"Today Im going but one day Ill back to prove myself, who Im...","author":"Adeel Ahmed","category":"life-changing"},{"quote":"You can either be the victim of your own life, or the victor\\".","author":"Catie Hartsfield","category":"life-changing, life-lessons"},{"quote":"REBELby Tatyana DiasI have the might of separating the fight between darkness and light.With ashes that surpasses my sight, crime in time slashes, isolating my rights.I speak with my eyes, and visualize with my mind.I'm on a quest that has left me possessed and stressed 'cause I envy the blessed and pity the depressed.You can whip me, strip me, crucify me to a cross; my imagination within my deepest destination will not fall!","author":"Susane Colasanti, Take Me There","category":"life-changing, life-lesson"},{"quote":"Inspiration should always be free.","author":"Jimmy Videle","category":"inspirational, life-changing"},{"quote":"Redundancy is like a plug being pulled out in a bath tub.

Yeah, all right, He wants us to like Him, and He wants us to respect Him, so well live right and do good. But God is goodright?and to be really good youve got to have humility, we all know that, so then if God is the best of the best, then Hes also the humblest of the humble. Right? So maybe it embarrasses Him to be praised like around the clock, to be called great and mighty all the time. And maybe it makes Him a little bit nuts the way were always asking Him to solve our problems instead of even trying to solve them ourselves, which He made us so we could do.

All had helmets on their heads, and lances and shields in their hands; their numbers increased, and when Gerda had finished her prayer a whole legion stood around her.

J. R. R. Tolkien's fairy-tale epic the Lord of the Rings helps draw the distinction perhaps. Some of its admirers have tried to make it into a religion book by claiming, among other things, that the Ring of Power which must be destroyed is the hydrogen bomb. Tolkien, on the other hand, denied this unequivocally. But intended or otherwise, there can be little doubt that for many it has become a religious book. The \\"Frodo Lives\\" buttons are not entirely a joke, because something at least comes to life through those fifteen hundred pages, although inevitably it is hard to say just what. It seems to have something to do with the way Tolkien has of making us see the quididity of things like wood, bread, stone, milk, iron, as though we have never seen them before or not for a long time, which is probably the truth of the matter; his landscapes set deeper echoes going in us than any message could. He gives us back a sense that we have mostly lost of the things of the earth, and because we are ourselves of the earth, whatever else, we are given back too some sense of our own secret. Very possibly again he did not intend it. I may well be axiomatic that, religiously, a writer achieves most when he is least conscious of doing so. Certainly the attempt to be religious is as doomed as the attempt to be poetic is.","author":"Frederick Buechner, A Room Called Remember: Uncollected Pieces","category":"lord-of-the-rings, religious, religious-writing, tolkien"},{"quote":"Then the Lord said: \\"If you had the faith the size of a mustard grain, you would say to this black mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea!' and it would obey you.

It has an equally innate and - in higher organisms - adaptively acquired responsibility for the injuries and invasions it regularly encounters in its permanently allocated environment or conquered surroundings. Such immune systems could equally be described as organismic early forms of a feeling for transcendence: thanks to the efficiency of these devices, which are constantly at the ready, the organism actively confronts the potential bringers of its death, opposing them with its endogenous capacity to overcome the lethal. Such functions have earned immune systems of this type comparisons to a 'body police' or border patrol. But as the concern, already at this level, is to work out a modus vivendi with foreign and invisible powers - and, in so far as these can bring death, 'higher' and 'supernatural' ones - this is a preliminary stage to the behaviour one is accustomed to terming religious or spiritual in human contexts. For every organism, its environment is its transcendence, and the more abstract and unknown the danger from that environment, the more transcendent it appears.","author":"Peter Sloterdijk, Du mu?t dein Leben ?ndern","category":"environement, immune-system, practising, religious, spiritual, transcendence"},{"quote":"Knowledge and the study of God's Word is voided by the folding of unwilling hands.","author":"Joshua Roman","category":"christian, religious, spiritual, spirituality"},{"quote":"If I were a religious person, I would have been very freaking one; mixture of logic and lie.","author":"M.F.

Boredom is the end product of each and every civilization. It is the arteriosclerosis of the great thinking peoples. The moment always arrives where even God, whether hes called Zeus, Zebaoth or Zoroaster, has finished creating the universe and asks: Whats the point of it, actually? He yawns and chucks it aside. Mankind does the same with civilization. Boredom is the condition of a people which no longer believes but all the same is doing just fine. Boredom is when every clock in the country is predestined to be correct. When the same naive flowers blossom again in the month of March. When every day the deaths of good family fathers are announced in the papers. When a war breaks out in the Balkans. When poems go on about the stars. Boredom is a symptom of aging. Boredom is the diagnosis that talent and virtue are slowly being spent. Boredom is the life-long determination to a form of being which has worn itself out.","author":"Iwan Goll","category":"boredom, life, mankind"},{"quote":"Error regarding life necessary to life. - Every belief in the value and dignity of life rests on false thinking; it is possible only through the fact that empathy with the universal life and suffering of mankind is very feebly developed in the individual. Even those rarer men who think beyond themselves at all have an eye, not for this universal life, but for fenced-off portions of it. If one knows how to keep the exceptions principally in view, I mean the greatly gifted and pure of soul, takes their production for the goal of world-evolution and rejoices in the effects they in turn produce, one may believe in the value of life, because the one is overlooking all other men: thinking falsely, that is to say. And likewise if, though one does keep in view all mankind, one accords validity only to one species of drives, the less egoistical, and justifies them in face of all the others, then again one can hope for something of mankind as a whole and to this extent believe in the value of life: thus, in this case too, through falsity of thinking. Whichever of these attitudes one adopts, however, one is by adopting in an exception among men. The great majority endure life without complaining overmuch; they believe in the value of existence, but they do so precisely because each of them exists for himself alone, refusing to step out of himself as those exceptions do: everything outside themselves they notice not at all or at most as a dim shadow. Thus for the ordinary, everyday man the value of life rests solely on the fact that regards himself more highly than he does the world. The great lack of imagination from which he suffers means he is unable to feel his way into other beings and thus he participates as little as possible in their fortunes and sufferings. He, on the other hand, who really could participate in them would have to despair of the value of life; if he succeeded in encompassing and feeling within himself the total consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a curse on existence - for mankind has as a whole no goal, and the individual man when he regards its total course cannot derive from it any support or comfort, but must be reduced to despair. If in all he does he has before him the ultimate goallessness of man, his actions acquire in his own eyes the character of useless squandering. But to feel thus squandered, not merely as an individual fruits but as humanity as a whole, in the way we behold the individual fruits of nature squandered, is a feeling beyond all other feelings. - But who is capable of such a feeling? Certainly only a poet: and poets always know how to console themselves.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche, Human, All Too Human","category":"mankind, thinking-falsely, value-of-life"},{"quote":"Well in those parts (upcountry India) they have were-tigers, or think they have, and I must say that in this case, so far as sworn and uncontested evidence went, they had every ground for thinking so.

This you may know when the bombs plummet out of the black planes on the market place, when prisoners are stuck like pigs, when the crushed bodies drain filthily in the dust. You may know it in this way. If the step were not being taken, if the stumbling-forward ache were not alive, the bombs would not fall, the throats would not be cut. Fear the time when the bombs stop falling while the bombers live- for every bomb is proof that the spirit has not died. And fear the time when the strikes stop while the great owners live- for every little beaten strike is proof that the step is being taken.

They assume that our bodies are a gift that we should bestow selectively on others, rather than the one thing that can never be anything but our own. Even if we do share it, it is ours irrevocably.These are the bodies that hold the brains we're supposed to shut off all day at work, the same bodies that aren't important enough to heal. These are the bodies that come with the genitalia that we should be so protective of? I really don't understand the logic.You can't tell us that our brains and labor and emotions are worth next to nothing and then expect us to get all full of intrinsic worth when it comes to our genitals.

And this deeper reason has to do with a certain pride that had not hitherto been known in these parts. To understand this new pride the cheapness of human life must be kept in mind. There were always plenty of people clustered around a mill C but it was seldom that every family had enough meal, garments, and fat back to go the rounds. Life could become one long dim scramble just to get the things needed to keep alive. And the confusing point is this: All useful things have a price, and are bought only with money, as that is the way the world is run. You know without having to reason about it the price of a bale of cotton, or a quart of molasses. But no value has been put on human life; it is given to us free and taken without being paid for. What is it worth? If you look around, at times the value may seem to be little or nothing at all. Often after you have sweated and tried and things are not better for you, there comes a feeling deep down in the soul that you are not worth much.","author":"Carson McCullers, The Ballad of the Sad Caf and Other Stories","category":"self-worth"},{"quote":"It's not easy to get close to anyone....

What primarily distinguishes fundamentalists from other religious practitioners, in fact, is the extreme importance they give to the body: what it does, what parts of it appear in public, what goes into and comes out of it. Even when fundamentalist norms require hiding a part of the body behind a veil, headscarf, or other articles of clothing, they are really signaling its extraordinary importance. Womens bodies are obviously the object of the most obsessive scrutiny and regulation in religious fundamentalism, but no bodies are completely exempt from examination and controlmens bodies, adolescents bodies, infants bodies, even the bodies of the dead. The fundamentalist body is powerful, explosive, precarious, and that is why it requires constant inspection and careNationalist fundamentalisms similarly concentrate on bodies through their attention to and care for the population. The nationalist policies deploy a wide range of techniques for corporeal health and welfare, analyzing birthrates and sanitation, nutrition and housing, disease control and reproductive practices. Bodies themselves constitute the nation, and thus the nations highest goal is their promotion and preservation. Like religious fundamentalisms, however, nationalisms, although their gaze seems to focus intently on bodies, really see them merely as an indication or symptom of the ultimate, transcendent object of national identity. With its moral face, nationalism looks past the bodies to see national character, whereas with its militarist face, it sees the sacrifice of bodies in battle as revealing the national spirit. The martyr or the patriotic soldier is thus for nationalism too the paradigmatic figure for how the body is made to disappear and leave behind only an index to a higher plane. Given this characteristic double relation to the body, it makes sense to consider white supremacy (and racism in general) a form of fundamentalism.","author":"Antonio Negri; Michael Hardt, Commonwealth","category":"biopolitics, body, fundamentalism, nationalism"},{"quote":". . . there was a softness to Cashs gaze that made her want to lean into it.

They live by mechanical time. They rise at seven o'clock in the morning. They eat their lunch at noon and their supper at six. They arrive at their appointments on time, precisely by the clock. They make love between eight and ten at night. They work forty hours a week, read the Sunday paper on Sunday, play chess on Tuesday nights. When their stomach growls, they look at their watch to see if it is time to eat. When they begin to lose themselves in a concert, they look at the clock above the stage to see when it will be time to go home. They know that the body is not a thing of wild magic, but a collection of chemicals, tissues, and nerve impulses. Thoughts are no more than electrical surges in the brain. Sexual arousal is no more than a flow of chemicals to certain nerve endings. Sadness no more than a bit of acid transfixed in the cerebellum. In short, the body is a machine, subject to the same laws of electricity and mechanics as an electron or clock. As such, the body must be addressed in the language of physics. And if the body speaks, it is the speaking only of so many levers and forces. The body is a thing to be ordered, not obeyed.","author":"Alan Lightman","category":"body, clock, cyborg, machine, physics"},{"quote":"The body is an organ of memory, holding traces of all our experiences.

Or any sort of headache-inducing oops moment, like the time one of the restaurant managers called to ask if he could fire a line cook after discovering that the man was a convicted murderer.Jeez. Howd you learn that? Brooke had asked.He made a joke to one of the waiters about honing his cooking skills in prison. The waiter asked what hed been serving time for, and he said, Murder.I bet that put an end to the conversation real fast. And yes, you can fire him, Brooke had said. Obviously, he lied on his employment application. All of Sterlings employees, regardless of job position, were required to answer whether theyd ever been convicted of a crime involving violence, deceit, or theft. Pretty safe to say that murder qualified.Ten minutes later, the manager had called her back.Um . . . what if he didnt exactly lie? I just double-checked his application, and as it turns out, he did check the box for having been convicted of a crime.Brooke had paused at that. And then the next question, where we ask what crime hed been convicted for, what did he write?Uh . . . second-degree murder.I see.
