But we ourselves want to recover our past selves, want to get rid of the past, and really realize that people have destroyed ourselves. However, we should not dwell on the past, and we should not give up the future for our children. It sounds simple, but it turns out to be too difficult!</p><p>---021---</p><p>It is easy for lovers to say things that really hurt others, but it is also good for children to be completely open to you after they realize you are a good person.</p><p>---022---</p><p>Mountain wine is like champagne, it can intoxicate heroes but also paralyze cowards.</p><p>---023---</p><p>&quot;Have you ever thought that I loved you to the extreme of a man&#39;s love for a woman? Have you ever thought that I had loved you for many years before I got you? Over the years, I have wanted to fly away and forget you many times, but I just couldn&#39;t forget you, and I came back again this time. My dear family, I rushed back at the risk of being arrested just to find you. But you hurried away to marry Frank Kennedy after that. I think it was jealousy. If Frank had died this time, I would have killed you too. I never loved you, but I just wanted her to be gone, you know. Life is so cruel to you, dear Carrie.</p><p>---024---</p><p>One said, &quot;I really want him to be happy in the future, but if you really want this happy, what use will you have with it? No, what use will you have with Ashley? If you really love her, you throw away your happiness with both hands, and at the same time, you reach out to her to pursue it. If you really want to be happy forever, you really want to be happy. I love you and understand you, Scarlett, I understand you thoroughly. This is definitely not what Ashley can achieve, but you have to spend your whole life dreaming about pursuing a man you don&#39;t understand.</p><p>---025---</p><p>Life&#39;s under no obligation to give us what we expect. We take what we get and are thankful it&#39;s no worse than it is.</p><p>We have an obligation to visit our friends every day. We should accept the good news and be grateful that things are not worse.</p><p>---026---</p><p>Grandma said: We are the ones who bow our heads to the things that we cannot avoid. We are not wheat, but buckwheat. When wheat is ripe, it is dry and cannot bend with the wind. When the storm comes, it falls down. When buckwheat is ripe, it can bend. When the wind blows, it can almost stand straight. We are not the kind of people who stand straight but the kind of people who are stiff-necked. When the wind blows, we are gentle and docile because we know that this is not the most important thing. When we encounter difficulties, we bow our heads. There is no need for us to make a fuss. We are gentle and do not need to wait for the opportunity. When we have a low point, we will kick away those stepping stones. This is the secret to overcoming difficulties, I really want to say.</p><p>---027---</p><p>No matter what, Ming just feels that he is the new one.</p><p>---028---</p><p>Girls at this age really want to live such a happy life, it is impossible for them to be defeated, beautiful clothes and pretty faces are the weapons to conquer fate.</p><p>---029---</p><p>You don&#39;t know that my love for you has reached the limit of a man&#39;s love for a woman.</p><p>---030---</p><p>She had never known a man she had ever loved, and she had always been the one who had fallen in love with him. Now she realized with a vague eye that if she had known Ashley, she would never have loved him: and if she had known Rhett, she would never have loved him. She was in a state of despair, wondering if there was anyone in college who she really wanted to know.</p><p>---031---</p><p>Have you ever thought that I loved you as much as a man could ever love a woman, and that I had loved you for so many years. I tried everything I could, but I couldn&#39;t get out of this, because you knew I was weak and used my love against me. You were too cruel to me. You grabbed our love and swung it over our heads like a whip.</p><p>---032---</p><p>I like to think of Bonnie as you, as if you were just a little girl who had been tormented by strife and poverty. She wanted to be like you, so free, so brave, happy, and cheerful. I could pamper her and spoil her - just like I pampered you. But she was different from you in one thing - she loved me. So I was very happy to be able to take your love for me. ... When she was open, I felt that everything was open.</p><p>---033---</p><p>In a flash, you&#39;ve become a person who has thought about you. It&#39;s like thinking about yourself, riding a horse, sleeping on a soft bed, and you can&#39;t put too much into it.</p><p>---034---</p><p>He loves you, wants to get you, and he can&#39;t understand you better than he does now. Xiaoshan is simple, as simple as the wind blowing over the sky, as simple as the muddy river flowing around the road. Even at the end of his life, he still understands the more complicated self than he did when he was young. At this moment, Xiaoshan is facing a complicated character for the first time.</p><p>—— But he gave his love to an unknown secret.</p><p>---035---</p><p>When you really want to work hard for it, you will truly fall in love with it.</p><p>---036---</p><p>To be honest, if you really recognize his bravery and youth, you will feel that he is a good boy. After he has beaten the boy, he will definitely face disaster. Why do you think he will not be defeated in the end?</p><p>——Blindly pursuing courage and youthful awareness is only tantamount to bringing disgrace upon oneself.</p><p>---037---</p><p>Ellen never taught him that desire and desire are completely different. Life and nature also teach people that the quickest climbers may not be the first to climb the mountain.</p><p>——Desire is enough, but it is not really recognized as desire.</p><p>---038---</p><p>Scarlett, I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together and tell myself that the mended whole was as good as new. What is broken is broken—and I’d rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I lived.</p><p>---039---</p><p>Sir, you’re no gentleman. And you miss are no lady.</p><p>---040---</p><p>A beautiful appearance does not necessarily make a woman a lady, and fine clothes cannot hide a bad heart.</p><p>---041---</p><p>Scarlett</p><p>I was in love with some imaginary self of mine who was immortal like Melanie.</p><p>It was like I had sewed a beautiful dress for her and she really fell in love with it.</p><p>The family came to Ashley&#39;s riding trail and ran over, and they really thought you looked so beautiful and so special.</p><p>I will just put on a set of clothes for you every day, regardless of whether they fit you or not.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to see clearly what&#39;s going on with you.</p><p>I have never really recognized a set of beautiful clothes in my life, but I don&#39;t really recognize you as a person.</p><p>---042---</p><p>I, a bystander with a turbulent life, was finally put on the stage and was able to play a small supporting role, but my acting skills were too poor. I could no longer return to my family stage, and the family stage was occupied by some strangers who trampled on it at will. I felt that he was no longer the same as before.</p><p>---043---</p><p>In college, men are willing to do everything for women, but they just can&#39;t tolerate women being too smart.</p><p>---044---</p><p>All these people had experienced devastating disasters, and they were destroyed by their own deeds. They were destroyed by the overthrow of empires, by the machetes of rebellious slaves, by wars, rebellions, world plunder and confiscations. Perhaps the unfortunate fate broke their necks, but they conquered their hearts. They did not complain, but struggled hard. They died exhausted and unsatisfied. The blood of these people flowed in their veins, and these shadowy events seemed to quietly come and go in this clean room.</p><p>---045---</p><p>Freedom became a never-ending picnic, a revelry of thievery, insolence and ceremony.</p><p>---046---</p><p>Scarlett&#39;s eyes fell on the two of them, who stood by the tree and watched the boy, with her hands in her trouser pockets. After the incident, the two of them left the house, and the two of them stood alone, watching the conversation grow more and more heated, without saying a word. The two of them showed a red lip that curved under a closely trimmed black mustache, and the two of them had a pair of dark eyes that gleamed with amusement and contempt - the kind of contempt that made them feel like they were listening to a quarrel between two people.</p><p>---047---</p><p>But he gave his love to an unknown secret.</p><p>---048---</p><p>Desire and life are the codes we can learn; life is also the wind and the wind, and we have to interact with each other, and the quickest one may not win. Lying in the silver shadow, her heart was filled with swollen courage, secretly drawing up her own plan, which was a plan that a girl could draw up. During this period of time in life, she felt that life and youth were only beautiful, and it was impossible to fail. Beautiful skirts and pretty faces were weapons enough to conquer fate.</p><p>---049---</p><p>&quot;My love for you has worn out, worn out by your stupid stubbornness, worn out by your stubbornness, like a dog with no horn on a hill, thinking of something else and having to get it... My love has worn out.&quot;</p><p>---050---</p><p>Just as Mammy could only say more, Ren Xiaoyi felt that only vinegar could attract flies.</p><p>---051---</p><p>I love you, Scarlett. It turns out we are so alike. We were both rebels, we were selfish bastards. But we felt comfortable and at ease with him for more than ten years, and we didn&#39;t care if the whole college was ruined.</p><p>---052---</p><p>&quot;There is nothing holy about wars,&quot; he said. &quot;It is holy to those who have the duty to fight. If the people who start a war do not make it sound holy, what fool would go to the war? Especially, no matter how beautifully the orators shout the slogans of the war, and no matter how high the purpose of the war is, there is only one motive for fighting, and that is money. All wars are not essentially for money. There are too few people who understand this truth since ancient times.

You know I couldn&#39;t leave you, because I know you always thought I was weak and wanted to use my love against me. You always thought of Ashley. This really pissed me off. We couldn&#39;t sit face to face with you at the table at night, because I know you didn&#39;t want Ashley to sit on my bed. I couldn&#39;t hold you in my arms at night, because I know it&#39;s over, and now we&#39;re done.

I found a handsome suit of clothes, and I fell in love with it. Ashley rode up there, and he looked so handsome and so different, and I put it on me, not caring whether it would suit me or not, and I didn&#39;t want to see what kind of person I was.
