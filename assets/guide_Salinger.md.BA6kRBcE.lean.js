You are not alone in this, you know, and you must be excited and encouraged. Many people throughout history have experienced moments of moral and spiritual uncertainty. Fortunately, a few of us have recorded our own experiences of uncertainty. You can learn from it - if you want to. Just as you will make a contribution someday, so can you. It is a wonderful cycle of events. And this is not education. This is history. This is poetry.</p><p>---031---</p><p>All I know is that I miss this person I&#39;ve been talking to for years.</p><p>---032---</p><p>This is not the case with girls. If you meet a bastard who is not only mean, but also arrogant, you will find that he has an inferiority complex every time you mention it to girls. The problem with girls is that they will find that no matter what kind of bastard he is, they will find that he has an inferiority complex; if they find that they don&#39;t like him, then no matter how nice he is or how much inferiority he has, they will find that he has an inferiority complex. Even smart girls are not immune to this.</p><p>---033---</p><p>You have to pay back the money.

It&#39;s so scary to see someone yelling on the street late at night. You can see that the heart of a man in a foreign country is not the same as that of a man in a foreign country.

Maybe it is only a brief glimpse, but that sudden glance is enough to make me excited.</p><p>---041---</p><p>Hey, if she finds you dead, they&#39;ll take good care of you. If I die myself, I&#39;ll just hope some smart guy will just dump my body in the river or something. What&#39;s the best way to do it, except that God will send me to a goddam cemetery to see people coming to see you every year and put a bunch of flowers on your belly and all that bullshit. Who cares to see flowers when someone dies? No one can see them.</p><p>---042---</p><p>A woman&#39;s body is like a violin, and she needs to be a great musician to play good music.</p><p>---043---</p><p>Love is wanting to touch something but pulling back.</p><p>---044---</p><p>I was thinking, there&#39;s a bunch of little seeds playing games in a big field of wheat. There are thousands of little seeds, and there&#39;s only one person nearby - only one adult, I mean - except me. I&#39;m standing on that damn cliff. My job is to watch there, and see if any of the seeds are running over the cliff, and I have to catch them - I mean the seeds are running like crazy, and they don&#39;t know where they are running, so I have to tell them to come out and catch them. I&#39;m a special little kid. I just want to be a watcher in the wheat field. I know this is a bit weird, but this is what I like to do. I know this is not the right thing.</p><p>---045---</p><p>No matter who it was, she knew it after seeing it for a long time.</p><p>---046---</p><p>Loving you is the only thing I can see, we are not a lady.

I think love is wanting to touch but not pulling back.</p><p>---047---</p><p>I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they&#39;re running and they don&#39;t look where they&#39;re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That&#39;s all I&#39;d do all day. I&#39;d just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it&#39;s crazy, but that&#39;s the only thing I&#39;d really like to be.</p><p>---048---</p><p>She looked so soft-hearted that she looked like a wolf. Those people who watch fake movies and make their mothers cry, nine of them look at me in their hearts and think they are despicable bastards.</p><p>---049---</p><p>Life is like a big ball game, you have to play by the rules.</p><p>---050---</p><p>I think that all the sufferings in the world are caused by external things, which are not good for the outside world. The fragments of life are so fast and small, and they can also make people feel bruised and battered. There is also a situation that tells us that the things in life that are so bland in the world can not extend the fear.</p><p>---051---</p><p>I was so tired that I could not answer, so I just stood up and went to the window to look out at the center of the neutron. For a moment, I felt extremely lonely. I simply wished I were dead.</p><p>---052---</p><p>The other thing is, when you find out she&#39;s having sex with a girl for sex -- I don&#39;t mean a prostitute or anything -- more than nine times she&#39;s either stopped or told you to stop. My other thing is, I couldn&#39;t stop. Mostly it happens to men. I can&#39;t help it. You either can&#39;t be sure they&#39;re telling her to stop, or they&#39;re scared, or they&#39;re telling her to stop on purpose, in case you do it, then you&#39;re at fault, and then you can get out of it.</p><p>---053---</p><p>In a boy-meets-girl story ，the boy should always meet the girl.</p><p>In a place where &quot;when a male mature meets a female mature&quot;, it is said that either the male mature is also overactive and aggressive.</p><p>---054---</p><p>The ugly girl who can be justified by the Lord can also be pitiful by the Lord.</p><p>---055---</p><p>That&#39;s not the same as mine, it&#39;s so cold that it can get so cold on the witch&#39;s nipple, especially on this damn little neutron.</p><p>---056---</p><p>For what kind of people is this whole arrangement made? Just for a certain class of people who, at one time or another in their lives, want to find some convenience that their environment cannot provide for them. Or just want to find some convenience that their environment cannot provide for them.</p><p>So we have to stop looking.</p><p>We have to use the convenience of the little brother to find the way forward, otherwise the wind will suddenly change and we will stop looking for it.</p><p>---057---</p><p>I like Jesus and stuff, but I&#39;m not interested in the Bible and that kind of stuff. Take the disciples, for example. They&#39;re so bad that I&#39;m tired of them, I&#39;ll tell you as a kid. Jesus died for his country, and they&#39;re all good, but when Jesus says something else, they just kind of poke a hole in your head. They just let it out. I think the Bible is better than the disciples.</p><p>---058---</p><p>The sign of a person&#39;s immaturity is to die with great fanfare in the first life. The sign of a person&#39;s maturity is to go on with humility in the first life.</p><p>---059---</p><p>I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a sad or unhappy thing, I just want to leave her for many years, or I want to leave her in a happy mood. She can&#39;t help herself; I feel even more uncomfortable when I leave!</p><p>---060---</p><p>People either think that some extraterrestrial stories are right</p><p>---061---</p><p>There is a kind of person who will force you to tell your secrets, but you will only find her a little bit of your privacy, and she will find that she is living a miserable life. This kind of smart person is also special. If they are not under their own command, they will not want to have an interesting conversation with you, and they will tell you that you can&#39;t say anything.</p><p>---062---</p><p>&quot;You get to a point in this kind of education where you discover the size of your brain and what&#39;s right for it and what&#39;s not.
