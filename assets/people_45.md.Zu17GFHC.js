muggi muggur in malaysia his father is a karaoke singer and as the crowds at the karaoke bars in the small fishing villages they were touring had problems pronouncing his name they came to call him mugison mugison is the icelandic naming convention for the surname of someone who is the son of muggiat the age of one his family moved from reykjavik to isafjordur when he was six his family then moved to a series of islands on the west african coast by the name of cabo verde his father was there as part of a volunteer program teaching locals how to fish mugison spent an idyllic childhood in cabo verde owning various pet monkeys and spending vast amounts of time swimming he did not start school until the age of ninefrom the age of 10 to 14 he lived in and around many parts of reykjavk at 14 he moved to a small island in the north of iceland called hrsey during the winter he was sent to a boardingdorm school from 1417 this is where mugison began to explore and discover music prior to moving to hrsey he had been a keen swimmer and football player not overly interested in the artsduring the summer of 1990 whilst working on hrsey he saw a poetmusician play a gig which was a major turning point in his life the artist in question was kjartan h grtarsson mugison was so fascinated by kjartans mysterious presence most notably his hair that he sought him out and requested the musician teach mugison how to become an artist kjartan agreed and they met every wednesday in order for him to impart his widom and expose mugison to all kinds of weird and wonderful music and literature including frank zappa the beat poets and key icelandic poetry he told mugison that this knowledge was crucial as it could lend itself to conversations all over the world no matter where you were from or where you were another aspect of the teacherpupil scenario included a field trip on how to look at women an invaluable lesson this union has led to a lifelong friendship with kjartan h grtarsson creating subsequent cover art for the album mugiboogiehaving learnt the tricks of the trade from kjartan h grtarsson mugison moved to reykjavk in 1993 at the age of 17 this was the year nirvana released in utero and bjork put out debut both highly influential albums in mugisons life he attended hamrahlaskli menntaskli he chose this particular school as so many artists had graduated from there most notably pll skar who mugison was a huge fan ofduring his time at hamrahlaskli he befriended an influential character called kiddi kanna who owned the iconic record shop hljmalind kiddi was very involved with the early careers of sigur rs and bjork and turned mugison onto artists such as sonic youth and pavement this was an important friendship which solidified mugisons love of music and encouraged him to participate and explorein 2000 mugison went to londons middlesex university sae to complete a ba hons in recording art during his time in the uk he experimented with creating music on computers interested in creating more portable music options mugison visited an apple store to enquire when the laptop would be big enough to handle music only to be told by a salesperson unequivocally that laptops wouldnt ever be big enough to make music at the same time bjork was predicting that all music would be made on laptops in the near future in various interviews she gave sharing the same vision as someone as influential as bjork made mugison even more determined that he was on the right path so he purchased a second hand apple 3g powerbook with the sole intention to create music on it during his studies in london digigram released the vx pocket soundcard this new technology was so expensive that after mugison purchased his prize possession he could not afford to pay rent for the rest of his semester so had to sleep on friends sofas for the rest of his term in london the investment was worth it and he began working on his debut album lonely mountainwhilst working on his debut album mugison spent a lot of time listening to andy votel and matthew herbert these electronic artists were very important to him and they both ran small record labels twisted nerve records accidental records and influenced his own music makingupon completing the record he made 10 burnt copies and sent them out to various labels in hope that a record label would release it the cd was sent to all the usual suspects 4ad records xl recordings etc he ran out of copies but wanted to contact twisted nerve records so he rather charmingly farted in a mayonnaise jar sealed the lid and posted it to the label accompanied by a note stating if you like the smell of this fart youll love my music amazingly enough andy votel wrote back pledging to release his first split 7 single with andy also featuring on the vinyl recordhe also sent a copy to matthew herbert who ran accidental records rather it was more akin to a love letter as mugison was a great admirer of his work matthew responded to the record and agreed to release his debut album on accidental the artwork for the record and all subsequent mugison cds were all handmade the cd packaging was ambitious with mugison and his family handstitching over 10000 copies before putting them all on a boat to england matthew herbert took mugison under his wing and nurtured his talent becoming another mentor to him at this point mugison had never played a live gig in 2003 herbert was booked on a three week dj tour of japan during this tour herbert insisted he perform live as his support act thus mugison began to finesse his live performance one man showthe mugison show in the early days consisted of himself alone with a guitar and various gadgets sometimes a little tipsy always shambolic he built himself the mugibox a box no bigger than a suitcase that contained all the equipment he needed to go out on the road including his pants he had discovered ableton live by this point and played around with looping and various other tricks that the software enabled him to conjure up he played wild crashing guitar while mixing vocals and distorted breathing through a laptop there werent many other performers at this time using ableton live thus giving him a slight edge in that particular areamugison was booked to play at sonar 2003 in barcelona which turned out to be a monumental turning point in his career having grown disillusioned in his short time period of playing live he treated sonar as his last live gig playing in a basement parking garage there were a handful of people to watch him when suddenly seconds after he started playing the entire basement filled up with hundreds of people wishing to go out in a blaze of glory mugison played the gig of his life the crowd lapped it up and consequently became the talk of the festival unbeknown to mugison the reason for the sudden influx of people was because it had begun raining outside however the set was a hit and spurred him on to persevere with the live element of his careersonar 2003 was a turning point and because of the good publicity and general industry buzz created as a direct result of the show he was booked to tour many headline tours around france uk netherlands and denmark touring became part of his life one particular highlight was touring around europe with fellow icelandic band mm during 2004a fortuitous chance encounter with gruff rhys from super furry animals in london during 2003 led to mugison supporting the welsh band at the royal festival hall this was a particular highlight during his early careerafter many tours during 20034 mugison returned to isafjordur and was asked to create the soundtrack to an icelandic film niceland having no studio to create the town kindly lent him the church in which he could recordby the early fall of 2004 mugison had finished his second album mugimama is this monkey music which was recorded in an abandoned house in isafjordur also generously donated by the town he moved to reykjavik to release the album and perform at iceland airwaves festival 2004 his official gig at nasa was packed and he could feel that something was happening something big mugison was getting

university in 1946in 1953 barlow discovered that the frog brain has neurons which fire in response to specific visual stimuli this was a precursor to the work of hubel and wiesel on visual receptive fields in the visual cortex he has made a long study of visual inhibition the process whereby a neuron firing in response to one group of retinal cells can inhibit the firing of another neuron this allows perception of relative contrastin 1961 barlow wrote a seminal article where he asked what the computational aims of the visual system are he concluded that one of the main aims of visual processing is the reduction of redundancy while the brightnesses of neighbouring points in images are usually very similar the retina reduces this redundancy his work thus was central to the field of statistics of natural scenes that relates the statistics of images of real world scenes to the properties of the nervous systembarlow and his coworkers also did substantial work in the field of factorial codes the goal was to encode images with statistically redundant components or pixels such that the code components are statistically independent such codes are hard to find but highly

is el cadver de balzac balzacs corpse 1998 in which with respect to the great french novelist morales censures repetition and defends a new paradigm that will discover mystery to the readers making it a part of their daily lives this book was basic for the foundation of the quantum aesthetics movement that spread throughout the world and appeared in the united states of america as the world of quantum culture 2002 whose first chapter overcoming the limit syndrome belongs to morales in the books principio de incertidumbre uncertainty principle 2003 and la isla del loco the island of the lunatic 2005 the author goes deep into the chore and develops the ideas contained in el cadaver de balzac morales cultivates and unites all the genres that transgress the habitual limits of humankind in order to get to know and apprehend its nature this is the reason why eroticism appears constantly in his works together with science and terror in this way morales has written el juego del viento y la luna the wind and moon game 1998 which is the only universal erotic anthology that has ever existed in spanish the book of tales called erotica sagrada sacred eroticism 1989 and the essay por amor

shortly afterwards the name remained unofficial until its adoption by the iau in 1986the discovery was made by carefully examining an enlargement of a photographic plate of pluto and noticing it had a very slight bulge on one side this plate and others had been marked poor because the elongated image of pluto was thought to be a defect resulting from improper alignment however christy noticed that only pluto was elongatedthe background stars were notchristys earlier work at the naval observatory had included photographing double stars so it occurred to him that this bulge might be a companion of pluto after examining images from observatory archives dating back to 1965 he concluded that the bulge was indeed a moonthe photographic evidence was considered convincing but not conclusive it remained possible that the bulge was a giant mountain on pluto however based on charons calculated orbit a series of mutual eclipses of pluto and charon was predicted and observed confirming the discoverythe 1965 plates included a note pluto image elongated but observatory astronomers including christy assumed that the plates were defective until 1978in more modern telescopes such as the

cambridge uk mr kasuris law firm is of considerable repute he is considered to be one of the best legal minds in pakistanassassination of nawab mohammad ahmad kasurion november 11 1974 bhutto was awakened by a telephone call masood mahmood the directorgeneral of federal security force fsf was at the other end and told him that nawab mohammad ahmad kasuri had been killed as his son ahmad raza kasuri drove him and the family after attending a wedding party in shadman colony lahore it was past midnight when the car was ambushed from both sidesnawab mohammad ahmad kasuri was sitting beside his son ahmad raza in the front the young kasuri drove the car straight to united christian hospital where nawab kasuri was pronounced dead although the assailants were not visible ahmad raza nominated zulfikar ali bhutto as the man behind the murderous attack the simple reason he mentioned was that he ahmad was dead set against bhuttos policies and although elected on a ppp ticket he had become a member of the opposition party led by asghar khan he was so critical of bhuttos policies that he had not signed the 1973 constitutionwhile lodging the fir at the ichhra police station kasuri recorded every detail of the tragic event and when asked about the possible culprits behind the attack kasuri mentioned the name of bhutto despite the police officials opposition kasuri had a reason to suspect bhutto during his student life he was bold and outspoken and often argued with his teachers on one point or another he was even rusticated for one year when he was studying law in 1964 he completed his law and joined law practice when bhutto quit the ayub government kasuri was so impressed by his fiery speeches that he joined his party at its launch seeing his eagerness and the will to work bhutto appointed him as a member of the central working committeehowever kasuri was an idealist and soon became disillusioned with bhuttos pragmatic policies despite bhuttos strong opposition to attending the national assembly session summoned at dhaka on march 3 1971 kasuri remained adamant ghulam mustafa khar was asked to keep kasuri from drifting away but that did not work and kasuri continued criticising bhutto in the national assembly finally bhutto wrote to khar and the chief minister malik mairaj khalid asking why kasuri had not been ostracized however bhutto underestimated the trouble kasuri would create being a lawyer bhutto should have known the consequences of such an fir there is no understanding how he took it so lightly and continued work as usualon the other hand ahmad raza kasuri appeared at the national assembly session on november 20 nine days after his fathers murder he had brought a small bottle of fluid claiming that it was his fathers blood and a bloodstained shirt and announced that the governments murderous attacks on the members of parliament would be exposed he continued in this vein for quite some time and always spoke of bad governance and injusticenobody knows how and why the police kept the fir and did nothing to dispose of the case after the military coup gen zia initiated the task of scanning various papers to find some legal flaw that could lead to the elimination of prime minister bhutto once and for all and this was the fir that gave zia the weapon he needed whether this fir played a role in taking bhutto to the gallows is a legal issue years later many believe that the fir became instrumental in ending bhuttos life the case rested entirely on the confession dg fsf who it is believed became the approver and a witness to this crime after a tortourus twomonth detention by the military in the end there were no eye witnesses to the attack so much so that the fsf guns which the confessing accused claimed to have used in the murder attempt did not match the empty cartridges found at the scene"},{"author":"Gregory L.

the 1960s he established himself in the united states for a while working together with willis carto publishing white supremacist and antisemitic literaturepearsons anthropological work is based in an evolutionary and racialist approach of the kind that was common in anthropology in the early 20th century based on the idea that the progress of humankind depends on making sure that favorable genes are segregated out from amongst unfavorable genetic formulae he has consistently advocated that the human species consists of biologically distinct races which he defines as rival breeding populations some of which are intrinsically better fit than others and which competes against each other in a struggle for survival but which all too frequently intermingle to the detriment of the superior races he argues that the future of the human species depends on political and scientific steps to replace the genetic formulae and populations that he consider to be inferior with better ones through humane and benevolent eugenics policiespearson also published two popular textbooks in anthropology but his anthropological views on the race question have been widely rejected as unsupported by contemporary anthropology consequently pearson faced difficulties in publishing his work for this reason he founded several journals dedicated to publicising research that was otherwise excluded from mainstream journals journal of social political and economic studies as well as journal of indoeuropean studies which would become the most influential journal of indoeuropean linguistics in 1978 he took over the editorship of the journal mankind quarterly founded by robert gayre and henry garrett widely considered a right wing journal most of pearsons publishing ventures have been managed through the

author specialising in historical fiction and nonfictionborn in 1925 she lived in gunnedah until she was sent to a boarding school in sydney on the outbreak of wwii she left the school and returned to gunnedah where she ran the property with her mother an invalid father and eventually three italian prisoners of war she has written ten bookspatricia studdy clift a lifetime of experiencesdue to a number of enquiries on the interesting life of teacher farmer author illustrator wife and mother pat studdy clift below is a brief summary of some of the highlights of her remarkable achievements even in her mature years and legally blind for the last the last 17 years due to the insidious onset of macular degeneration she continues to pursue her love of researching and writing books on exciting people and events in our nations colourful historysome of her remarkable story is as follows initially educated by brackfriars correspondence school at the family rural property kareela outside of gunnedah in northwestern nsw followed by secondary schooling in sydney at ascham girls school to intermediate standard in 1943 aged 15 she joined the womens emergency signalling corps in sydney where she taught morse code to the personnel from the australian air force merchant navy and also american airmen who had trouble grasping the concept this was the time of the midget sub shelling on sydney suburbs and their torpedo attacks on harbour shipping in 1942 with her father doing his war duty as an army officer in victoria barracks in sydney and the family farm being run by a manager pats world was turned upside down when the farm manager suddenly resigned in 1943 and the women folk were required to returned to look after the property suddenly thrust into a mans world as a teenager she together with her mother and 5 year old brother faced the complexities of running a rural property compounded by wartime rationing and a raging drought battling these elements she learned many farm skills including killing and cutting up their own meat with pat even learning to drive a caterpillar type tractor to build a dam for part of their emergency water supplies one of her heartbreaking jobs was the mercy killing of stock at deaths door from the results of the drought a year after pat took over kareela her father was invalided out of the army and to relieve their man power shortage they were assigned three italian prisons of war pow for working on the property pat often worked on her own with these men in remote parts of the property and never felt threatened by them even though these people were technically the enemy she wrote and illustrated a book on these experiences titled only our gloves on the title reflecting that pat and her sister joan slept in the hot summer evenings in the nude but wore gloves to protect the bed sheets from the homemade concoction that softened their rough farmers hands in an effort to preserve their femininity pats older sister joan received her discharge from the australian womens army service awas towards the end of the war and returned home to help on the farm after the war pat and her sister became share farmers working their fathers land for a share of the profits with their own tractor truck and equipment they were the first known women broad acre share farmers in nsw and possible australia and traded as the studdy sisters with even their truck sign written with that title marrying jim clift from breeza nsw in 1948 they moved in late 1954 to a river front property near condamine in the western darling downs in queensland which they developed with almost 30 years of hard but rewarding work again she faced many challenges not the least of which was being left alone by the menfolk in a heavily pregnant state and with a small but active toddler and his two older brothers who travelled to school by boat and bus while being surrounded by floodwaters for 6 months and having no forms of communication heavily engaged in transforming the under developed lands into a thriving rural enterprise she also involved herself and the family with many local activities one unusual interest that the family followed from the start of the 1960s was water skiing on the local lagoons with pat becoming very proficient at water ballet she has written up these and many other experiences in a book called on the banks of the condamine with a later revised edition named on the banks of the condamine revisited it personalises the challenges of being on the land and threads a tapestry of the strong social fabric of the surrounding rural community of those times retiring to northern nsw in the 1980s and captivated by the cosmopolitan nature of the tweed shire she wrote and illustrated two books called the many faces of the tweed a snapshot of the characters from her newly adopted neighbourhood interviewing and recording a diverse range of people varying from followers of hare krishna and orange people through to singers like jade hurley and the civic movers and shakers she immersed herself in many aspects of local culture very foreign from her rural roots the second tweed book was a project in association with local unemployed youths having time to seriously pursue her love of writing she then undertook research and completion of a number of books on some of our lesser known events and characters a chance meeting with an ex northern territory policeman ron brown led to a collaboration between them that produced two books the first bush justice tells of rons experiences as a lone representative of the white mans law and mediator on camel patrols in the red centre of australia between 1945 and 1952 the second titled darwin dilemmas details life and the events at that top end administrative centre through the eyes of a local policeman stationed there between the years of 1939 to 1945 his firsthand account recalls the times of the much hushed up 68 air raids on northern australia by japanese bombers and the human face of darwin in the period in 1996 pat completed perhaps her most intriguing book to date thoroughly researched and based on historical facts the lady bushranger relives the life of elizabeth jessie hickman ne martini ne hunt a colourful woman with many aliases whose story remained hidden along with the wollemi pine and her hideout in the extended valleys of the blue mountains until the early 90s jessies early circus life cattle duffing repeated escapes from the police and her final taming are now portrayed for all but like most accounts of bushranging adventures it is mixed with truth legend and mystery in between all these activities pat with a strong love of music found time to teach the piano organ and keyboard at one time she even played for a choral group appropriately named the condamine belles following pats diagnosis with macular degeneration in the early 1990s her sight has deteriorated to a world of blurred images and shapes with some very very minor peripheral vision she treats her handicap as just another one of lifes challenges and continues to undertake as many of her previous activities as possible unfortunately she can no longer do her own illustrations cooking at times has provided an interesting interpretation of the menu with noncorrect identification of critical ingredients writing continued to be a passion for pat and she produced two books in 2009 the first chronicled the history of a small 1934 monoplane called st paulus that started its flying life in the wild and rugged new guinea mainland for a german based roman catholic mission and after many adventures and mishaps including an attack by a japanese zero the plane ended up in australia passing through several owners and continuing to notch up some very interesting escapades the incredible klemm survives to this day as most likely the oldest mission plane in the world her second effort also came from new guinea during world war ii when aided by an aussie expat a group of five nuns walked for three months from the sepik coast over some of the most rugged country on earth up the highlands to escape the japanese titled when nuns wore soldiers trousers it reveals a tale of adventure and endurance known to few outside of png pats final literary effort an addendum to her lady bushranger book provides an update of her continuing research and data collection on that subject since its original publication 15 years before she feels her lady bushranger book will be perhaps her most lasting legacy and illustrates this by stating it has been under film options almost since its production unfortunately now her failed sight has meant that she cannot carry on with her love of writing as she is unable to keep track of the continuity in presenting a story even in her senior years life is never dull for pat as she often is presented as one of the lismore city librarys living books that readers borrow for half an hour before putting her back on the shelf despite being in her mid 80s pats mind is as sharp as ever and illustrating this point is the example of a recent conversation when it was stated that she was visually impaired her retort was that there was nothing wrong with the way she looked but she had trouble with her eyesight and so was actually vision impaired"},{"author":"Rob.

in an iconic photograph that showed her shouting at elizabeth eckford one of the little rock nine during the integration crisis in her later life she would attempt to make amends for this and briefly became friends with eckfordin 1998 massery told the guardian i am not sure at that age what i thought but probably i overheard that my father was opposed to integration but i dont think i was old enough to have any convictions of my own yet later in life she changed her mind she had thought of martin luther king as a troublemaker but realized deep down in your soul he was rightin 1963 having changed her mind on integration and feeling guilt for her treatment of eckford she took the initiative of contacting eckford to apologize they went their separate ways after this first meeting and eckford did not name the girl in the picture when asked about it by reportersby 1998 she was working with young black motherstobe and minority students in part to make amends for her past actions as well as because she was irked by being permanently represented in the media by a single photo however as part of the 40th anniversary celebration of central highs integration will counts wanted to take a second photo symbolising reconciliation massery agreed and was reintroduced to eckford the two swiftly became friends spending time together to the point that she joked she was eckfords chauffeurshe appeared with eckford and the rest of the little rock nine on the oprah winfrey show and at the 40th anniversary celebration of integration at central high the reunion provided an opportunity for acts of reconciliation as noted in this editorial from the arkansas democratgazette on the first day of 1998one of the fascinating stories to come out of the reunion was the apology that hazel bryan massery made to elizabeth eckford for a terrible moment caught forever by the camera that 40yearold picture of hate assailing grace which had gnawed at ms massery for decades can now be wiped clean and replaced by a snapshot of two friends the apology came from the real hazel bryan massery the decent woman who had been hidden all those years by a fleeting image and the graceful acceptance of that apology was but another act of dignity in the life of elizabeth eckford soon after the friendship began to fray as eckford began to believe massery wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on she wanted me to be less uncomfortable so that she wouldnt feel responsible anymore massery also began to revise parts of her story to present the photo as an isolated incident when shed been involved in racist dialogue after it and attempted to avoid implicating her family as a source of racial views the friendship quietly dissolved in 1999 and she retreated from the public eye speaking of her public actions as a mistake the two women have only spoken twice since both times in 2001 the first being a call to eckford during 911 though the masseries sent a condolence card after eckfords son was killedsince the friendship ended eckford has spoken of massery as being exhibitionist and profiteering and a bornagain bigot"},{"author":"Mel
