emotions and attitudes linked to such interpretive processes over the course of more than 40 years he has explored a variety of topics his doctoral dissertation on the nature of urban anonymity involved participant observation in new yorks times square area this initial interest in the social psychology of city life led to the publication of his coauthored and widely respected book entitled
