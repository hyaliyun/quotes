from 1990 to 1992 luis gispert creates art through a wide range of media including photographs film sounds and sculptures focusing upon hiphop youth culture and cubanamerican history some of his sculptures incorporate objects identified with hip hop such as turntables chrome tire rims and boom boxes into functional designs usable in other manners such as furniture he first rose to fame due to his well received chearleaders set of art photographs which he started in 2000 several of the pics feature chonga style women and helped to establish congas as a miami icon comparable to ghetto fabulous imgages his installation art graced the 2002 whitney biennial at the whitney museum of american art and has been exhibited internationally at galleries and museums such the brooklyn museum of art and the studio museum in harlem in new york art pace in texas the museum of contemporary art north miami the contemporary arts museum houston palazzo brocherasio in turin and the royal academy in

mary boone gallery in new york rhona hoffman gallery in chicago and ohwow gallery in los angelesgispert describes the first ten years of his career as a period during which he underwent a personal transformation in his attempt to comprehend why certain objects and events strike him physically and emotionally always there is the push andpull between seduction and aggression in his work that inundates the viewers senses his photographs videos films and sculptures are complex composed arrangements that delve into the familiar and the unknown the mainstream and the marginalized to expose and address the various subcultures that infiltrate the mainstream these subjects also provided him the means to explore the sheer aggressiveness and excessiveness of the hip hop ornamentation or the effusively decorated interior of his immigrant familys homes similarly the volume of the rap lyrics lipsynched by a cheerleader in can it be that it was all so simple then 2001 or the unnerving scream

during the brooklyn museums annual artist ballhis most recent photographs of landscapes viewed through the windows of customized vehicles achieve the widescreen grandeur of cinemascope film and provide the viewer the sensation of occupying the drivers seat he shot hundreds of sheets of film for each landscape in an attempt to capture the perfect vista but ultimately collaged various details to produce landscapes that most closely adhered to his ideal gisperts cheerleader series of lush color photographs depicting cheerleaders accessorized with the hip hop gold chains and jewelry first brought him to the art worlds attention although this series was perceived as a reference to popular culture and cultural identity gispert approached the subject from the perspective of baroque religious paintings depicting levitating saints at moments of epiphany and the conventions of sports photography which established the iconic image of the sports hero in mid air the cheerleader photographs were achieved with cinematic techniques and methods to produce special effects most notably the greenscreen gispert used a long exposure to photograph his models suspended on wires in a chromakey green room in movies actors play against the green background which is typically superimposed onto another backdrop to complete the illusion however gispert retained the green field to reveal the artifice filmmaking has played a major role in gisperts career he has consistently contrasted films that use the syntax of cinema as exercises in the manipulation of sound image and film time as in stereomongrel 2005 and smother 2008 with raw aggressive videos that deliberately contradict film conventions gispert has used elements of destruction to designate the end of one phase of his career and the beginning of another he always approaches new projects by trying to work himself out of a problem this occasionally requires the obliteration of the past and has manifested itself
