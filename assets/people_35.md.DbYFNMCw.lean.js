2007 sale to ing directin 1998 seely created sharebuilder securities as an online brokerage to serve middle market investors and to encourage people to start investing and save regularly seely pioneered the concept of allowing automatic dollarbased investing in any stock or exchange traded fund which provided a practical and affordable way for the retail investor to employ dollarcost averaging as an investment method in those securities there were several elements incorporated in the design of the automatic investing system that were highly innovative and that eliminated much of the back office cost associated with retail customer trades thereby making dollarcost averaging functional and affordable the united states patent and trademark office issued patent 8682771 covering the method of aggregating individual investor purchase orders to enable fractional share dollarbased investingin 1999 these were the first retail brokerage accounts where every communication and business process was conducted electronically new account applications account approvals monthly customer statements and trade confirmations were all processed over the internet andor sent electronically sharebuilders automatic investing system was the first commercial program that employed an inhouse share accounting system that accepted customer orders for any stock or etf on a dollardenominated basis instead of specified share amounts this enabled the investor to set a predetermined dollar amount for monthly investing and accumulate both whole and fractional shares of stock as the program executed most importantly this form of investing is based on aggregating customer orders across all stocks being bought enabling the trade cost to be spread across a multitude of buyers and allowing efficient order execution for even small orders for example a customer investing only 50 in both google and microsoft every month would have their order grouped with thousands of dollars worth of other orders enabling better order execution fractional share purchases and a commission as low as 1 per transactionjeff is a trustee on the washington state investment board which oversees

opened the refrigerator one day i looked at that tuna salad and i said thats enough of this i dont need to eat this its not like i lived in a place where you couldnt get decent food its easy so i quit

work was exhibited in 2007 at the opening show of the new gallery spacehis works show the ordinary seemingly trivial moments observed within the vicinity of the artist within the familiar streets once his attention is attracted the painter cautiously becomes involved with the motif often he returns to vary the focus or perspective of the seen hereby his sight is distant neutral but not without sympathy the constant review of his and our perception of what we call reality adds an observatif character to his work this becomes evident especially in works in which knobloch depicts an identical scene more than once but from only slightly modified perspectives the impression of a filmic sequence is generated yet knoblochs works does not allow the audience to make up a story which develops logically according to cause and effect his works appear to be oddly disconnected deposed of the temporary by detracting the scene from a temporal sequence and by this means from any narrative context knobloch directs the perception of the audience onto the artwork itself in most cases he puts everyday items in the centre of his work in doing so the visible is not deposed of its seemingly vacuity the power of these works comes from the intense uneventfulness of the seen the audience is bound to fill the silence with its own memory thus knobloch achieves to evoke poetic associations and this is where the quality of his works lies his works are not about subjective experience but about reflection"},{"author":"Jim Bond","quote":"jim l bond born 1936 is a minister and emeritus general

works in statistical decision theory game theory behavioral decision theory risk analysis and negotiation analysis he helped found and was the first director of the international institute for applied systems analysishis book applied statistical decision theory with robert schlaifer introduced the idea of conjugate prior distributionsa lecture of his in the 1960s concerning the use of bayesian methods for betting on horses gave john craven usn a us navy scientist the idea of using bayesian methods to search for a missing us air force hydrogen bomb lost near palomares spain in the 1966 palomares b52 crash craven used the same methods again in the search for the lost submarine uss scorpion in 1968 raiffa has analysed situations involving the use of subjective probability and argues that subjective probabilities should follow the same rules the kolmogorov axioms as objective frequencybased probabilitiesconsider a situation in which you are required to gamble and are given two possible gamblesgamble a in which you bet on the outcome of a fight between the worlds greatest boxer and the worlds greatest wrestler in a ring fight assume you are fairly ignorant about martial arts and would have great difficulty making a choice of who to bet on if your chosen champion wins you win 500 otherwise you get nothing you place your choice in a sealed envelope which is opened after the gamegamble b draw a ball from an opaque urn known to contain 50 orange and 50 blue balls you will receive 500 if you draw an orange ball and nothing for a blue ball the balls have been thoroughly mixed and you should assume that all balls are equally likely to be drawn the draw takes place after the ring match is overmany people would feel more unsure about taking gamble a in which the probabilities are unknown rather than gamble b in which the probabilities are easily seen to be one half for each outcomeraiffa argues that a decisionmaker should in fact assign a subjective probability of onehalf to each outcome of gamble a provided that no information was available that makes one outcome more likely than the otherraiffa argues as follows suppose someone has the following preferences if forced to take gamble a they would bet on the boxer but if given a free choice between the gambles they would prefer gamble b presumably such a person when allowed to choose gamble a would prefer to simply bet on the boxer rather than toss a coin to decide the matter of whether they should bet on the boxer or the wrestler but this randomised approach is equivalent to gamble b so by the axioms of substitutability and transitivity for utilities they should also prefer to bet on the boxer than on gamble b a similar argument can be used to show that when the player has no preference between the boxer and the wrestler he should also have no preference between gamble a and gamble bthe axiom of substitutability says that if someone is indifferent between outcomes a and b and indifferent between outcomes a and c they should be indifferent between b and c the axiom of transitivity says that if someone prefers outcome a to b and also prefers b to c then they should prefer a to cothers such as daniel ellsberg disagree with raiffas reasoning and have devised alternative interpretations of decision theory one of the most radical departures is dempstershafer theory which rejects the use of probability theory completely in favour of a theory of belief functions which do not satisfy the axioms of probability"},{"author":"Chris Taylor (journalist)","quote":"chris
