indian hijacker who immigrated to canada under a false name balbir singh he fought deportation when his true identity was discovered and stayed in canada for 15 years earning a law degree before he was deported in 2010 he hijacked an indian airlines plane that was flying from srinagar to new delhi forcing it to reroute to lahore in 1984 he was sentenced to death in a trial in pakistan but released after ten years imprisonmentaccording to the background contained in the federal court of canadas decision with respect to the refusal of sainis application for permanent residency in canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in 1984 saini a citizen of india was convicted in pakistan of hijacking a passenger airliner from india that was rerouted to pakistan after serving 10 years in jail in pakistan saini came to canada in february 1995 under a false name and made a successful claim for refugee status on or about september 1995 his true identity came to light and he was arrested by immigration authorities who then found him inadmissible to canada and a danger to the public the underlying application for humanitarian and compassionate relief contained inter alia the following submissions from sainis counsel referenced by the responsible immigration officer in his decision and cited by the federal court that saini was very young when the offence was committed he responded emotionally to a historical moment after the attack on the golden temple by the indian army that saini is fearful of returning to india because of the human rights violations in india and others in similar situation who have returned have been killed that saini was a high profile person given the fact that he committed a high profile crime and is at risk of serious mistreatment in india that there existed including reports on human rights abuses against sikhs in the punjab that many years have passed and that was the only offence saini was convicted of that in the 7 years in canada almost 4 years since his release from immigration detention saini has not posed a danger to the public nor has he been convicted of any further offencesthe immigration officer refused to exercise positive discretion finding instead thatthe applicant committed an offence terrifying to the civilised world he was found guilty convicted of such an offence and served 10 years imprisonment the federal court of canada has determined that the pardon applicant received from the pakistani government does not have the same effect as the pardon system in canada i also note that the federal court of canada has upheld the effectiveness of deportation order and that the danger opinion certified by the minister is also effective the passage of time does not in itself reduce the seriousness of the crime committed therefore i am not satisfied that the personal risk he may face upon returning to india would outweigh the risk that applicant poses to the public of canada having considered all the information provided i am not satisfied that the hardship on returning to india would be disproportionate or undeservedin the judicial review of the officers decision madam justice snider found the decision to be reasonable refused to intervene and set aside the decision and specifically referenced the nature of sainis offence by quoting the federal court of appeals decision in 2001 the gravity of the crime of hijacking is obvious it is universally condemned and punished severely although there is no evidence of the particular circumstances of this offence hijacking is an offence that is always very serious section 76 of the criminal code makes it an offence punishable by life imprisonment canada has ratified international treaties such as the convention for the suppression of unlawful seizure of aircraft signed at the hague on 16 december 1970 860 unts 105 and the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation concluded at montral on 23 september 1971 974 unts 178 which recognise that hijacking aircraft jeopardises the safety of persons and property seriously affects the operation of air services and undermines the confidence of the peoples of the world in the safety of civil aviation these international instruments do no require canada to deny entry to any person convicted of hijacking but strongly emphasise the serious nature of the crime and encourage signatories to severely punish hijacking take actions to discourage it and generally cooperate page 227 in the international condemnation of this crime it is clear that hijacking is considered to be among the most serious of criminal offences hijacking may combine in one act numerous offences including kidnapping unlawful confinement theft assault extortion and
