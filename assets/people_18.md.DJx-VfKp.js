1986 stasiuk had left his native warsaw and withdrew to the seclusion of the small hamlet of czarne in the beskids a secluded part of the carpathian mountain range in the south of poland outside writing he spends his time breeding sheep together with his wife he also runs his own tiny but by now prestigious publishing business wydawnictwo czarne named after its seat apart from his own books czarne also publishes other east european authors czarne also republished works by the migr polish author zygmunt haupt thus initiating haupts rediscovery in poland while white raven had a straight adventure plot stasiuks subsequent writing has become increasingly impressionistic and concentrated on atmospheric descriptions of his adopted mental home the provincial southeast of poland and europe and the lives of its inhabitants galician tales one of several works available in english among the others are white raven nine dukla fado and on the road to babadag conveys a good impression of the specific style developed by stasiuk a similar text is dukla 1997 named after a small town near his home dukla achieved stasiuks breakthrough in germany and helped built him the most appreciative readerbase outside poland although a number of stasiuks books have been translated into several other languagesin an interview stasiuk confessed his preoccupation with this area and a lack of interest in western europe i havent been to france or spain and ive never thought about going there i am simply interested in our part of the world this central and eastern reality my god what would i be doing in france stasiuk himself cites marek hasko as a major influence critics have compared his style of stream of consciousness travel literature to that of jack kerouac stasiuk admitted that he always wanted to write a slavonic on the road and place it in a quite geographically limited and historically complicated space1 stasiuks travelogue jadc do babadag travelling to babadag describes a journey from the baltic sea down to albania and arguably comes close to this ideal in stasiuks own words there is no individual human story in this book i wanted rather to write about geography landscape about the influence of material reality on the mind jadc do babadag received the nike for the best polish book of 2000a certain exception to the stylistic preferences in stasiuks more recent work is the 1998 novel dziewi nine which is set in warsaw and records the changes affecting urban polish society after the collapse of communism apart from semi fictional writing stasiuk also tried his hand at literary criticism in tekturowy samolotcardboard aeroplane 2000 and quasipolitical essayism on the notion of central europe together with the ukrainian writer yuri andrukhovych in moja europa dwa

slavogermanic medical tragifarce a stageplay commissioned by the schauspielhaus of dsseldorf germany for a theatre festival to celebrate the enlargement of the european union in 2004 in the guise of a grotesque crime story stasiuk presents two imaginary nations symbolising eastern and western europe and easily recognisable as poles and germans who are entangled in an adversarial but at the same time strangely symbiotic relationshipin 2007 stasiuk continued to deal with the polishgerman topic in a travelogue titled dojczland in which he described his impressions of germany from his reading tours there in an interview in 2007 stasiuk commented on his fascination with the topic as follows i fear both the germans and the russians i despise them both equally and i admire them both maybe its the poles fate to be constantly meditating on their own fate in europe and in the world being a pole means to live in perfect isolation being a pole means to be the last human being east of the rhine because for a pole the germans are something like wellconstructed machines robots while the russians are already a bit like animalsin an interview with wprost at the close of 2011 he again discussed europe and in particular germanythe word germany has a heavy legacy beginning with its etymology which means mute in polish someone with which you cannot communicate because of his incomprehensible language they have really tried to learn from the past and are still trying and i say this without irony and with respect but when there is a group someone has to dominate thats how it is of course the poles would rather play this role but germany will dominate the germans need to be the best at everything and what is needed is to put them on the rails to good leadership in other words they need how shall i put it a bit of monitoring i like germany by contrast its a world that is the opposite of ours i dont admire germany i just like to go there from time to time to see how matter is tamed and organised polishness must also certainly be a sort of feeling of superiority unjustified of course but still without danger without troubles poland is less alive whenever nationalism comes knocking on the door it feels better right away it perks up and gets its strength back so long live german nationalism which doesnt mean does it that we must not remain vigilant"},{"author":"Terry

and public health during her chairmanship she tried to focus attention as much on member states performance in transposing and applying new eu laws as on the adoption of more such laws this was during a period of very intense legislation in the area of water and air pollution waste disposal and controls on chemicals jackson controlled the committee firmly but with humour qualities very necessary when german opponents of new laws on alternative medicines attempted to control proceedings in 1995 it was noted that on 11 september 2001 jacksons committee was the only one that did not adjourn when

by 2020 created for the commission the possibility of putting in place waste reduction targets and cleared up the question of the status of incineration of waste as a form of recovery rather than disposaljackson believed that david cameron was wrong to direct the conservative meps to leave the european peoples party in 2009 because this meant a huge loss of political influence she pointed out that the conservatives had in fact enjoyed a high level of political independence within the epp she argued that the conservatives new position from 2009 in the conservatives and european reformists group with the czech ods party the polish law and justice party and a motley crew of european rightists would mean that they would lose influence and visibility in the european parliament at precisely the moment when the parliaments powers were increasing she made her views known in press articles in 2009 and cameron feared that she might follow her husband robert v jackson mp for wantage 19832005

the intention of delivering them to agents of the soviet union with boyces stolen documents lee traveled to mexico city where he delivered them to soviet embassy officials lee often also would use these trips as an opportunity to engage in drug deals when not working on espionage a common tactic of lees drug smuggling was to learn of airline routes where he would fly from mexico to the united states hiding the drugs inside a compartment of the plane mainly the airline restroom purchasing a ticket to whichever destination the same airplane was scheduled then recapturing the drug stash after disembarking at the new destinationlee and boyce made an agreement to evenly split the profits from the espionage ring boyce had used his share mainly for his personal use lee used his split of the profits to further his drug business purchasing more expensive drugs such as heroin and being able to gain tremendous profits by selling the expensive hardtoobtain drugs in the united states at one
