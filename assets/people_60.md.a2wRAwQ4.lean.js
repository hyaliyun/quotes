business throughout his life aside from his position on the shura council he is involved in a variety of organizations in saudi civil society while he is a devout muslim he is highly critical of the way islam is publicly practiced and the degree to which modern muslim societies are governed by itthe central concern of his writings is the relative decline of arab and islamic civilization compared to the other civilizations of the world from his studies he has concluded that western civilization has several deep cultural principles that make it more dynamic more openminded and therefore able to develop faster through empowering individuality and independent thinking these principles developed in the west over centuries beginning in ancient greek philosophy and gaining power in the age of enlightenmenthe concluded that other nonwestern cultures such as japan were able to advance to a high level of development and freedom only by taking and incorporating these crucial principles from the west by incorporating these principles in their culture countries such as japan managed to actually invigorate their culture and prevent it from stagnating while simultaneously matching the west in power freedom and standard of livinghe blames the failure of arab societies to develop and innovate on their refusal to learn from other civilizations or to criticize the principles of their own society he advocates the incorporation of modern science and critical thinking in the heart of arab culture as it was in japan thus while arab public society would develop along free modern and selfcritical lines the heritage of islam would still provide the spiritual backbone of arab civilizationhis concern with the decline of the condition of the arabs has led him to conclude that the situation in saudi arabia is sad and shameful so it is clearly necessary not only to be concerned but to be deeply anxious i learned early in my life that a dreadful flaw afflicts the lives of others but at first i did not understand the reasons my deep anxiety impelled me to study our history and culture in depth in search of the source of the flaw and also led me to devote attention to the triumphant western civilization beginning with greek philosophical thought continuing through the political social scientific anthropological and other achievements of the west i became convinced that western civilization is exceptional and pioneering and is not an extension of the previous civilizations it is civilization par excellence the excellence of the west lies not in its accomplishments in the sciences arts and technology but rather these accomplishments are the outgrowth of the wests respect for profit the free system its liberty and the establishment of government in the service of the peoplethe government belongs to the people and they do not belong to it as like in all other countries of the world this is a qualitative change unprecedented in human history and the source of

based on his own research differ to some degree from the conventional wisdom for example while the public tends to support various forms of gun control legislation they hold out little hope that such laws will reduce gun violence coverage of the issue in the national news media tends to be mostly objective but when there is a bias it is almost always in favor of gun control while the national rifle association receives a great deal of attention in the news its portrayal is much more likely to be negative than positivewilson devotes a chapter of the book specifically to gun policy in the commonwealth of virginia a sabbatical in 2003 provided wilson the time to attend several virginia general assembly sessions where he interviewed legislators and lobbyists according to wilson because

policywilson views guns as tools that may be used for recreation protection or crime with the purpose being defined by the guns owner self admittedly his conclusions lean towards arguments for gun

coappointment at the university of connecticuthis principal interests include philosophy of mind philosophy of language philosophy of linguistics epistemology and metaphysics the author of eight books and over 150 articles and over 20 reviews lycan is an advocate of the version of functionalism known as homuncular functionalismlycan is an unapologetic realist and physicalist about almost everything mental states intentionality and consciousness epistemic justification linguistic meaning perception especially color and smell moral properties aesthetic properties and more this realist physicalist philosophical tapestry is held together by several common threads the view that persons are complex systems composed of subpersonal systems subsubpersonal systems etc all the way down to subatomic functions the view that natural teleology is ubiquitous that there exists a nonideal but nonetheless discernible evolved fit between human capacities and the environment the view that meaning in natural language manifests a logical form that at its core is truthfunctional and morethese and other common threads are prominent in lycans theories of mind mental states are typeidentical to functional states instantiated in sub or subsubpersonal systems where the function of any such state is determined by its natural teleology this is lycans homuncular functionalism the appeal to teleology dissolves problems with earlier functionalist theories especially those concerning consciousness a correct theory of consciousness on lycans view comprises multiple parts corresponding to the multiple phenomena to which the term consciousness is applied thus lycan defends a higherorder inner sense theory of awareness according to which attention mechanisms have the function of monitoring and integrating lower level psychological processes a pronominal theory of subjectivity according to which the subjective or perspectival nature of conscious states is a product of the utterly unique semantic role of introspective mental concepts eg i a representational theory of qualia according to which sensory qualities are the intentional objects of sensory representations and more consciousness 1987 consciousness and experience 1996these same threads are prominent in lycans account of knowledge including his account of belief acquisition and epistemic justification to acquire a new belief is to acquire a new real internal representation instantiated in ones functional architecture and a new belief is justified if it better than its competitors increases the explanatory coherence of the persons entire belief set this is lycans explanationist theory of justification canons of epistemic value used to identify degrees of explanatory coherence are themselves justified by appeal to natural teleology judgement and justification 1988 in defense of his view lycan critically assesses major competitors especially reliabilism and other views eg epistemic minimalismmeaning in natural language logical form in natural language 1984 including the meaning of indicative conditionals real conditionals 2001 is explained by lycan in truththeoretic terms here too the requisite psycholinguistic machinery coheres with lycans homuncular functionalism and more generally with the above common threadsalong with robert adams lycan considers david kellogg lewiss notion of possible worlds to be metaphysically extravagant and suggests in its place an actualist interpretation of possible worlds as consistent maximally complete sets of descriptions or propositions about the world so that a possible world is conceived of as a complete description ie a maximally consistent set of propositions of a way the world could be rather than a world which is

themes along with serious portraiture that melds the sitters social position with a speaking likeness that reveals inner character witkin has been succinctly characterized as a virtuoso figurative painter whose work mixes elements of the old masters social realism and abstract expressionism witkin was born in brooklyn new york the twin brother of photographer joel peter witkin recognized as a prodigious talent at fourteen he entered the high school of music and art in new york and subsequently studied at the skowhegan school of painting and sculpture cooper union the berlin academy and the

exhibiting at galleries in new york and joined the faculty of the maryland institute college of art he later taught at the manchester college of art in england moore college of art and in 1971 became a professor of art at syracuse universitywitkins work can be thought of as an interrelationship of three bold explorations 1 the creation of realistic pictorial form with painterly gestures strongly influenced by his desire to absorb and surmount abstract expressionism as such his brush strokes and constructed forms are highly original and worthy of study in themselves 2 the deep implications of the death of his father which induced witkin to explore mortality and the underlying reality of personal and social relationships which is evident in his portraits and the characterizations in his narrative work 3 visually complex realist denunciations of major human rights issues as embodied in themes of torture assassination aids and the holocaust while significant elements of the global contemporary art scene seems fascinated with the relationship between art and fashion witkin worked on his holocaust series for twenty three years never rushing this serious exploration of the characters perpetrating and victimized by this horrorwhile his paintings reference the work of the old masters social realism and abstract expressionism witkin in a selfdeprecating manner refers to
