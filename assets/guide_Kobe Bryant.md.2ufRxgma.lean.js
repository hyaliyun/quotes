I don&#39;t want to be a shooting star. I don&#39;t want to be an All-Star player. I want to be the best in history. When I made this decision, I didn&#39;t feel that the game I played was of great significance to me.

I will never reach the other side of victory. I don&#39;t think about failure anymore. I just keep trying better.&quot;</p><p>---058---</p><p>&quot;The best way to win is to try not to think about injuries. When you feel that the injury is more important than anything else, you should not consider the injury as an issue. In this case, the injury will not become an obstacle to your victory, because the injury is not more important to you at all.&quot;</p><p>---059---</p><p>&quot;When I found myself in the middle of a negative outburst, I really thought that everything related to the game had changed. I now know that I may have underestimated myself because of the anger in the middle of a game, especially no matter how much the emotions can affect me, I have to return to the game and turn the anger into positive emotions. When you feel this kind of positive emotion, it&#39;s a new feeling, and I love this feeling.&quot;</p><p>---060---</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be different from the person who really wants to be me, that is, this person who really wants to be me is Jordan</p><p>---061---</p><p>My hearing is getting worse and worse.

We won!&quot; Ke Jue said that he was not afraid of Ren Xiaobai, but took Ren Xiaobai as a warning to motivate himself to work harder. But if you work hard enough and are confident enough, can you be afraid of Ren Xiaobai?</p><p>---068---</p><p>When I go into the gym, I feel like I can beat everyone.</p><p>---069---</p><p>I felt like the greatest player of all time at that moment, and basketball was everything to me.</p><p>---070---</p><p>I just keep throwing, no matter how old I am, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll miss it once, but I&#39;ll definitely miss it the first time!

If you think about it carefully, it is indeed quite philosophical. Ke felt that his remarks can be extended to mean, &quot;The more you fear any small defeat, the more likely you are to fail in the future.&quot;</p><p>---077---</p><p>The answer is &quot;not afraid of losing&quot;. When talking about the game, Kobe said that he was not afraid of losing when the ball was not on the court. When shooting in the air, you can&#39;t help but think &quot;what if the ball doesn&#39;t go in?&quot; When there is a buzzer beater, you can&#39;t help but think &quot;what if the buzzer beater doesn&#39;t go in?&quot; Kobe said that his mentality is &quot;not afraid&quot;. In 2010, when he used his hand to hit the buzzer beater to win the game, Kobe replied to the fans&#39; doubts, &quot;If you hit it, it&#39;s great; if you miss, there&#39;s nothing to be afraid of!&quot;</p><p>---078---</p><p>&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Kobe Bryant.

What matters most is not the goal, it&#39;s the journey.&quot;</p><p>---130---</p><p>&quot;0 in 30 shots is still better than 0 in 9 shots.&quot; Ke didn&#39;t mean that the more iron the better, but just to express a point of view, as long as you work hard enough and work hard enough, you won&#39;t lose. Ke believes that as long as you are a kid, you will never lose when you play against others.</p><p>---131---</p><p>&quot;Sometimes we want to play against the starting or substitute players, but we don&#39;t have to play anymore, and we want to be like this. Now we have a starting player, and we feel that when we play against Big Brook, we are ready to face the opponent with great intensity.&quot;</p><p>---132---</p><p>Everything I do is to pursue perfection.</p><p>---133---</p><p>Friends come and go, only the flag of the crown hangs forever on the dome.</p><p>---134---</p><p>&quot;As a kid who grew up in the Lakers, it was my dream to have my jersey hung above my head after playing for the Lakers. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be able to retire with a jersey. The Lakers have given me a great honor, and I&#39;m very grateful for the passion the fans have shown for this game.</p><p>---135---</p><p>I just keep practicing, keep practicing, and I won&#39;t stop until I&#39;m satisfied. If I feel something is not right, I will stay and practice, and I won&#39;t stop until I&#39;m right. I just keep practicing, keep practicing. This is how I learn my character, and this is also the first time I teach myself how to be true. If you focus on something, if you want to achieve something, you can&#39;t give up halfway, you have to devote all your energy to it and complete it, and do your best to complete it perfectly. This kind of practice is the only way to solve problems.</p><p>---136---</p><p>If someone is destined to win, why not me?</p><p>---137---</p><p>If you never fear.</p><p>---138---</p><p>If you work hard and realize your dreams, your life will come true.</p><p>---139---</p><p>Maybe the dream is not perfect, but I hope that something even better will come this year.</p><p>All the things he saw were paved with blood.</p><p>---140---</p><p>I really think you can only throw down the phone, how do you feel about him blowing a kiss to his family, and when I saw it for a moment I thought it was because of the fight. #Obamaout</p><p>---141---</p><p>Five crowns are indelible</p><p>---142---</p><p>He knew that in order to win the game, he could do anything, whether it was sitting on the bench, handing a towel to his teammates, or making a winning shot.</p><p>---143---</p><p>I know Los Angeles is not the sound of him at 4 am</p><p>---144---</p><p>Do you know Yu Buzi who works at 12 o&#39;clock in the early morning in Los Angeles? I know.</p><p>---145---</p><p>I feel that he is just a small person on the mountain, and there are ten people on the mountain who can win, so why can&#39;t I really recognize that person?</p><p>---146---</p><p>If the Lakers need to beat him, I really think that the Lakers will not fight against him.</p><p>---147---</p><p>Seize every opportunity when you get there, good boy, and prove yourself to yourself!</p><p>---148---</p><p>The one in the moon looked at Ke and asked, &quot;Why are you so successful?&quot;</p><p>Ke Jue said, &quot;Have you ever seen Los Angeles at midnight? I&#39;ve never seen Los Angeles at midnight.&quot;</p><p>---149---</p><p>Everything I do now is to pursue perfection.</p><p>What I&#39;m doing right now, I&#39;m chasing perfection.</p><p>---150---</p><p>I saw them constantly changing players to defend me, and I could feel the first player defending me getting scared, and once I got past him and scored, they would switch to another player, and I felt like he was driving the defensive player crazy and switching to the next one. No matter who was defending me, I believed that as long as I attacked him continuously for more than ten times, I would definitely collapse and give up.</p><p>---151---</p><p>seize the day and place no trust in tomorrow</p><p>---152---</p><p>Never underestimate the heart of a champion forever.</p><p>---153---</p><p>I know Los Angeles at dawn</p><p>---154---</p><p>As a six-year-old boy</p><p>Deeply in love with you</p><p>I never saw the end of the tunnel.</p><p>I only saw myself</p><p>Running out of one.</p><p>And so I ran.</p><p>I ran up and down every court</p><p>After every loose ball for you.</p><p>You asked for my hustle</p><p>I gave you my heart</p><p>Because it came with so much more.</p><p>---155---</p><p>We double-teamed the guys who signed the &quot;big contract&quot; and we had a chance to play against them. For the big stars who got the maximum salary, we didn&#39;t double-team them, but defended them one-on-one. These guys who signed the contract gradually became tired and complained all night that they couldn&#39;t get the ball. Finally, the atmosphere of the team became worse and worse.</p><p>---156---</p><p>Have you ever seen the streets of Los Angeles at dawn?</p><p>---157---</p><p>Ren Xiaoyi has someone who is more than ten years old and successful, why can&#39;t that person be me?</p><p>---158---</p><p>Always keep a curious mind</p><p>---159---</p><p>Jordan and I have to pass the torch to the next person. As we all know, inheritance is not something you want to do, it is something you win. Just see how hard I work and how hard I study. I believe I am the one who takes over the torch, so this is not an inheritance but a win, and it will take more time to verify. I believe that many players can realize this. Now, our time has begun!</p><p>---160---</p><p>I don&#39;t know how long it will take me to achieve greatness, I just want to do my best to be the best basketball player I can.</p><p>---161---</p><p>I really think that all these negative things, such as being pressed down by others and carrying heavy loads on my shoulders, are the catalysts for my success.</p><p>---162---</p><p>He tried to ask, &quot;Have you ever seen Los Angeles at midnight?&quot;</p><p>Ziqiang: &quot;If someone in Ren Xiaoyi wins by more than ten, why not me?&quot;</p><p>Trade-offs: In a person&#39;s life, there are always some choices you have to face, and you have to make some trade-offs.</p><p>Cheng Shenghao: &quot;My heart can withstand the impact, my spirit can withstand the hardship, and my origins are coming to an end.

I wake up in the morning and get excited for what&#39;s to come. If we don&#39;t have practice, I miss practice. If we don&#39;t have basketball games, I miss basketball games. We miss it more. If you feel that way, then you really want to be there.
