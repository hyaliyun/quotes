Parents will arrange a birthday party, certain it will stick in your mind forever. You&#39;ll have a nice time, then two years later you&#39;ll be like, &#39;There was a pony there? Really? And a clown with one leg?&#39;</p><p>Some people won&#39;t go the extra mile, and then on their birthday, when no one makes a fuss, they feel neglected and bitter.</p><p>You always get a special kick on opening day, no matter how many you go through. You look forward to it like a birthday party when you&#39;re a kid. You think something wonderful is going to happen.</p><p>I trained to be a priest - started to. I went to seminary school when I was 11. I wanted to be a priest, but when they told me I could never have sex, not even on my birthday, I changed my mind.</p><p>I gave a funny speech at my wife&#39;s birthday party, and I&#39;m thinking, &#39;Hey, I&#39;ve still got it.&#39;</p><p>My ace in the hole as a human being used to be my capacity for remembering birthdays. I worked at it. Whenever I made a new friend, I made a point of finding out his or her birthday early on, and I would record it in my Filofax calendar.</p><p>I want a chainsaw very badly, because I think cutting down a tree would be unbelievably satisfying. I have asked for a chainsaw for my birthday, but I think I&#39;ll probably be given jewelry instead.</p><p>I just had my 30th birthday and we went turkey shooting. It&#39;s what I wanted to do, so we went.</p><p>Every day, every birthday candle I blow out, every penny I throw over my shoulder in a wishing well, every time my daughter says, &#39;Let&#39;s make a wish on a star,&#39; there&#39;s one thing I wish for: wisdom.</p><p>I left school on my 15th birthday.</p><p>The worst part about celebrating another birthday is the shock that you&#39;re only as well as you are.</p><p>I like to go to anybody else&#39;s birthday, and if I&#39;m invited I&#39;m a good guest. But I never celebrate my birthdays. I really don&#39;t care.</p><p>When I was a kid, for my birthday every year, my mother made me pasta bechamel, which is rigatoni with a white cream sauce.</p><p>Anybody can have a birthday. It requires nothing. Murderers have birthdays. It&#39;s the opposite of anything that I believe in. And I don&#39;t like at work where you stop everything to sing &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; to someone. I feel like that&#39;s for children.</p><p>My best kiss was on stage. Kelly Rowland from Destiny&#39;s Child gave me a really nice soft kiss on my lips during a performance on my birthday. It was amazing.</p><p>I tried to bake a cake for my mother&#39;s birthday - it took me four hours. It was terrible, and I cried for three days.</p><p>My happiest memory of childhood was my first birthday in reform school. This teacher took an interest in me. In fact, he gave me the first birthday presents I ever got: a box of Cracker Jacks and a can of ABC shoe polish.</p><p>If we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.&#39;s birthday at a time of presidential inaugurals, this is thanks to Ronald Reagan who created the holiday, and not to the Democratic Congress of the Carter years, which rejected it.</p><p>Interventions are really emotionally exhausting and I would never ever want to have one. In the same way, I would never want to have a surprise birthday party. That would be horrible.</p><p>I had been offered a Hollywood contract before my 18th birthday. It gave me the spark I needed.</p><p>It is ironic that the one thing that all religions recognize as separating us from our creator, our very self-consciousness, is also the one thing that divides us from our fellow creatures. It was a bitter birthday present from evolution.</p><p>I tend to foster drama via bleakness. If I want the reader to feel sympathy for a character, I cleave the character in half, on his birthday. And then it starts raining. And he&#39;s made of sugar.</p><p>My second play, The Birthday Party, I wrote in 1958 - or 1957. It was totally destroyed by the critics of the day, who called it an absolute load of rubbish.</p><p>Since graduation, I have measured time in 4-by-5-inch pieces of paper, four days on the left and three on the right. Every social engagement, interview, reading, flight, doctor&#39;s appointment, birthday and dry-cleaning reminder has been handwritten between metal loops.</p><p>I&#39;m a summer baby, so I usually have my birthday as a good summer memory.</p><p>The Queen of Crafts herself, Martha Stewart, and I have the same birthday. I prefer to think it&#39;s the glue-gun wielding, perfect-tart-producing Martha and not the copper pan-throwing, jail-going Martha. But I suppose if I am going to share a calendar square with some of Martha, I have to share it with all of Martha.</p><p>I&#39;m over the moon to be involved in the &#39;Doctor Who&#39; Christmas special. I can&#39;t quite believe it as it&#39;s a part of the family tradition at the Jenkins household. I heard the news that I got the role on my 30th birthday and it was the best birthday present ever.</p><p>The first guitar I ever got was for my 13th birthday.</p><p>As I approach my 88th birthday, it&#39;s become apparent to me that my eyes and ears, among other appurtenances, aren&#39;t quite what they used to be. The prospect of long flights to wherever in search of whatever are not quite as appealing.</p><p>I&#39;ve got some incredible fans actually - so loyal and they make me birthday cards and Christmas cards. I got this package of poems and artwork based around the songs. They&#39;ve got this thing called &#39;Floetry&#39; where they all have to put in artwork. They&#39;ve set up their own competitions and stuff which is kind of amazing.</p><p>All my favorite stars, my family and my friends are here. I&#39;m having the happiest birthday that an 18-year-old girl could ever have.</p><p>John Candy knew he was going to die. He told me on his 40th birthday. He said, well, Maureen, I&#39;m on borrowed time.</p><p>I have had fans make me the big picture collages of the photo books I have had fans send me birthday cakes... sing to me on my voicemail. I have had fans flash me. I have had older fans give me their bras and underwear onstage.</p><p>The day before my 16th birthday I got my guitar.</p><p>I hate birthdays. I hate birthday parties. I hate them. I don&#39;t know what it is, anybody&#39;s only got to come wafting near me with a piece of cake with a candle on and I break out in hives.</p><p>I saw Richard Linklater&#39;s film &#39;Slacker&#39; for my twenty-first birthday. That was the moment when it all seemed possible. This guy gave me hope.</p><p>The reason I met my husband was because I remembered a friend&#39;s birthday. The moral of the story is: Remember people&#39;s birthdays.</p><p>You know, we&#39;d just had a birthday, he was... you know, he still had a future out of him, and all I can is he was just one of the most beautiful people in the world... a very gifted man, and it&#39;s a loss to the world, not just for us.</p><p>Citizens, thank you for all your birthday wishes. I am 88 years old today and still lucky to live in the greatest city in the world.</p><p>I worked at an ice cream parlor called Chadwicks. We wore old-timey outfits and had to bang a drum, play a kazoo, and sing &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; to people while giving them free birthday sundaes. Lots of ice cream scooping and $1 tips.</p><p>For the youth, the indignation of most things will just surge as each birthday passes.</p><p>I&#39;ve never looked forward to a birthday like I&#39;m looking forward to my new daughter&#39;s birthday, because two days after that is when I can apply for reinstatement.</p><p>I play PC and Xbox games at home, and I just got a PSP as a birthday present.</p><p>We didn&#39;t have a whole lot of money when I was growing up either. I would always ask for magic books or magic tricks for my birthday or for Christmas and the rest of the year I either had to mow lawns or find part time jobs to help supplement the cost of doing magic.</p><p>With my daughter, we do arts and crafts, we read a lot, we listen to music, and we cut the strings off balloons and bounce them around after birthday parties.</p><p>I was fired at the pinnacle of my career, on my 39th birthday. And in the year that followed, I learned that there are many psychological phases of being &#39;let go.&#39;</p><p>I get uncomfortable when people give me presents and watch me open them. I don&#39;t have birthday parties, because the idea of a group of people singing and looking at me while I&#39;m blowing out candles gives me hives.</p><p>My mom won&#39;t let me buy high-fashion stuff unless it&#39;s TK Maxx or a birthday occasion.</p><p>My mom and my father&#39;s birthday are on the same day.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to get the record that I made at my birthday party last year, trying to get that out, and the lawyers are diddling around with it and it probably won&#39;t be out until next year. I don&#39;t know.</p><p>And currently, there are four to five new works in the pipeline for upcoming celebrations such as the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Australian Federation, my 50th Birthday, and Sydney Dance Company&#39;s 25th Anniversary.</p><p>I was quite a shy child. I would get terribly nervous and throw up before my birthday party. And then I would be fine. I feel the same now. I get nervous, then it&#39;s fine.</p><p>I can put my legs behind my head and sing &#39;Happy Birthday.&#39; Because that&#39;s something that me and my friends used to do when we were in gymnastics class as kids, and I can still do it. I was doing it since I was 8 and 9. They used to call me Gumby. Very bendy.</p><p>I want to say that probably 24 hours after I told CBS that I was stepping down at my 65th birthday, I was already regretting it. And I regretted it every day since.</p><p>On my birthday, I was in Milan for the collections.</p><p>I lost twins at 14 weeks, and I had to have an D and C on my birthday.</p><p>I always wanted to shave. It is a very natural process. For my birthday I got a lot of shaving stuff.</p><p>I told my father I wanted to play the banjo, and so he saved the money and got ready to give me a banjo for my next birthday, and between that time and my birthday, I lost interest in the banjo and was playing guitar.</p><p>As far as those kinds of things, I also played at the concert to call for the release of Nelson Mandela when he was a political prisoner in South Africa. We were celebrating his 70th birthday and calling for his release.</p><p>I love photography. My boyfriend&#39;s got a great camera, which I bought for his birthday.</p><p>My son had his eighth birthday recently and we had a chance to borrow the film and show it to all of his friends that was at his birthday party and they loved it. I was a little nervous. I said they might not even like it, and say his daddy&#39;s movie is wack, but they loved it.</p><p>I grew up doing all that stuff because I was obsessed with the &#39;50s. I had sock hops for birthday parties. So I&#39;ve always done The Twist and stuff. It was pretty natural and, with my parents doing it all the time, I&#39;d just copy them. Not very pretty.</p><p>For my birthday my husband learned to cook and is cooking one day a week for me. But he only likes to do fancy dishes. So we end up with weird, obscure things in the refrigerator.</p><p>My first recognition of age setting in was exactly on my 36th birthday. I have no idea why, on this day of all days, I looked in the mirror and realized my face no longer looked young.</p><p>And for the city&#39;s birthday, we will host events in every neighborhood of the city, inviting all of our residents to share in the celebration of Boston&#39;s great epic - the story of neighbors who support one another where it matters most.</p><p>I hate birthdays. I thought that I only hated my own birthday, and then I realized that I hate my children&#39;s birthdays too.</p><p>I suddenly realized how much I loved her when we attended Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s 75th birthday party last August. There was something magical about that night, and it made me see how much she really meant to me.</p><p>Any time women come together with a collective intention, it&#39;s a powerful thing. Whether it&#39;s sitting down making a quilt, in a kitchen preparing a meal, in a club reading the same book, or around the table playing cards, or planning a birthday party, when women come together with a collective intention, magic happens.</p><p>I started running around my 30th birthday. I wanted to lose weight I didn&#39;t anticipate the serenity. Being in motion, suddenly my body was busy and so my head could work out some issues I had swept under a carpet of wine and cheese. Good therapy, that&#39;s a good run.</p><p>Well, I started conducting kind of by accident. I wanted to give myself a special birthday present for my fortieth birthday, and I was living in San Francisco at the time and I started attending some of the concerts and then simply dropping hints.</p><p>My mom FedExes a red velvet cake she makes from scratch to me every birthday.</p><p>Nicole will come up in conversations where it&#39;s in a part of the conversation. Or we may be somewhere and I would tell some story about their mother and I. You know, we always honor her birthday.</p><p>I went to a rare live Van Dyke show and met him there. And then he came to a show of mine and we spoke back stage. The third time was at Brian Wilson&#39;s birthday party.</p><p>The summer of 2002 at the Wilson birthday party I met Van Dyke again and I made plans to have dinner with him.</p><p>Mattresses! Beautiful! Let&#39;s go buy a couple of mattresses. Give &#39;em to people for their birthday.</p><p>One I built when I was a kid, and it was a real miniature of Disneyland. I fell in love with the park when I went there with my parents on my 12th birthday.</p><p>My parents were dishonest people. If it was my birthday, I knew my mother took me to the K-Mart and she stole my toy. She&#39;d put it in the shopping cart and we&#39;d walk out. I was raised with that.</p><p>We were probably the last people in the country to get a VCR and we didn&#39;t have cable. There wasn&#39;t any admiration of glamour, no, &#39;I want to look like them or have that lifestyle&#39;, because everyone in my town had the same lifestyle. So I didn&#39;t think, &#39;Ooh, a movie star&#39;s birthday!&#39; I just thought, &#39;What?&#39;</p><p>I&#39;ll never forget my 24th birthday when my tooth got punched out. And for a second I was like, it would be really hilarious if I sold it on eBay. But I can&#39;t, that&#39;s just too creepy. I don&#39;t think I can go there.</p><p>I did a cake for the 60th birthday of Elton John, for Britney Spears&#39; 27th birthday and for the &#39;Circus&#39; album she put out - the cake had circus themes. I prepared a cake for a surprise 82nd birthday event for the architect Frank Gehry the cake was comprised of mini-replicas of his buildings.</p><p>I&#39;ve looked after my money. As I started working around my third birthday, my first check went straight to the bank.</p><p>I had arranged a birthday party for him and my children, who are all Aquarians. Instead, we got married. I ran out of excuses. It was just us and my children.</p><p>There weren&#39;t any astronauts until I was about 10. Yuri Gagarin went into space right around my 10th birthday.</p><p>The turning point was when I hit my 30th birthday. I thought, if really want to write, it&#39;s time to start. I picked up the book How to Write a Novel in 90 Days. The author said to just write three pages a day, and I figured, I can do this. I never got past Page 3 of that book.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t very good about juggling family and my career. I was interested in who was coming to the children&#39;s birthday party, what my son was writing. I was thinking about Legos.</p><p>All I watch is the Food Network. I took a cheesemaking class a few weeks ago, and I told my family and friends to only get me kitchen stuff on my birthday. I&#39;m into every kind of cookbook and anything by Anthony Bourdain. I&#39;d love to own a restaurant if I could find the right chef.</p><p>I love having my birthday at Australia Zoo.</p><p>If there&#39;s one thing I really want for my birthday, that is for the mining company not to mine my daddy&#39;s reserve.</p><p>The American flag is an enduring symbol of liberty, democracy, and justice. It is fitting that the House act to protect it as we approach our nation&#39;s birthday, and as our men and women in uniform rally behind it in Iraq&#39;s battlefields.</p><p>Even when I was a kid, I had a good thing with kids. To this day, if I go to a birthday party with one of my kids, I swear to you, I am so much happier hanging out with my kids and their friends than talking to the grown-ups.</p><p>At her birthday, my seven-year-old daughter will say that she wants these big cakes and certain expensive toys as presents, and I can&#39;t say no to her. It would just break my heart. But when I was little, for birthdays we just played outside and we were happy if we got any cake.</p><p>For my birthday this year, my girlfriends - who knew I&#39;d just inherited my dad&#39;s turntable - gave me a carton of albums like &#39;Blue Kentucky Girl,&#39; by Emmylou Harris, and &#39;Off the Wall,&#39; by Michael Jackson. It&#39;s all stuff we grew up with. I mean, you can&#39;t have a music collection without Prince&#39;s &#39;Purple Rain&#39; - it just can&#39;t be done!</p><p>When I was in elementary school, I used to write letters to myself. I&#39;d write letters and go &#39;Dear Kristen-at-16-years-old, happy birthday. I hope you&#39;re doing something.&#39;</p><p>My brother got a .22 for his 12th birthday I got a .22. He got a hunting knife I got a hunting knife.</p><p>I married two weeks after my 18th birthday, far too young, and by the time I was 23 I was a single mother of three small children, Sean, Daniel and Victoria, living in a prefab house.</p><p>On a royal birthday every house must fly a flag, or the owner would be dragged to a police station and be fined twenty-five rubles.</p><p>I was fired by &#39;America&#39;s Next Top Model&#39; on my birthday.</p><p>I am a big popcorn fanatic. I love popcorn. In fact one year for my birthday, my husband bought me one of those big popcorn machines like they have in movie theaters.</p><p>With a recent birthday, I&#39;ve been acting now for twenty years.</p><p>Lucy took care of me on the set, and made sure that none of the crew cussed around me. She also had birthday parties for me and made sure that they were well attended.</p><p>Brilliantly lit from stem to stern, she looked like a sagging birthday cake.</p><p>I used to go down every year for the remembrance of Elvis&#39; birthday. Memphis State College invited me to sit in the auditorium and speak to the people for one of those Elvis days.</p><p>And I was very shy as a kid if you sang me &#39;Happy Birthday,&#39; I would cry. Quite shy. So the idea of being an actor, much less a model, was just out of this world.</p><p>I sing a little bit. I got a guitar for my 16th birthday.</p><p>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.</p><p>The hardest thing to understand in the world is the income tax.</p><p>There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.</p><p>Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.</p><p>If there is anything that a man can do well, I say let him do it.

I&#39;ve made movies that I thought were okay, but then I was very good. And sometimes you&#39;re in a movie and you think, I wish more people saw that - because you&#39;re good. And it just works out that the movie gets lost. But that&#39;s show business.</p><p>There is the expression of selfishness and there is the expression of selflessness - but economists or theoreticians never touched that part. They said: &#39;Go and become a philanthropist.&#39; I said, &#39;No, I can do that in the business world, create a different kind of business - a business based on selflessness.&#39;</p><p>I still work hard to know my business.

Take inventory of what you&#39;re good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills. Kindle is an example of working backward.</p><p>It&#39;s not just Bin Laden or just those that are involved in the counterterrorism effort. We&#39;ve gotta cast the net broader than that.

I&#39;ve been working with the Los Angeles Zoo for 45 years! I&#39;m the luckiest old broad on two feet because my life is divided absolutely in half - half animals and half show business. You can&#39;t ask for better than two things you love the most.</p><p>I am interested in a lot of things - not just show business and my passion for animals. I try to keep current in what&#39;s going on in the world. I do mental exercises. I don&#39;t have any trouble memorizing lines because of the crossword puzzles I do every day to keep my mind a little limber. I don&#39;t sit and vegetate.</p><p>I cannot stand the people who get wonderful starts in show business and who abuse it.

When you&#39;re quoted in the &#39;Wall Street Journal,&#39; the &#39;New York Times,&#39; constantly as the expert in the business people assume you&#39;re a lot bigger than you are. And then I had to run like hell to catch up with my own image.</p><p>My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There&#39;s no way I can control him. I wouldn&#39;t stay married to him if I felt I could. I can readily take my business personality into the home. But he forces me to be a partner rather than the boss.</p><p>It&#39;s a libel to say that I use my newspapers to support my other business interests. The fact is, I haven&#39;t got any other business interests.</p><p>We&#39;ve got to lift our game tremendously. We&#39;ll sell our business news and information in print, we&#39;ll sell it to anyone who&#39;s got a cable system, and we&#39;ll sell it on the Web.</p><p>One thing I resent is the slur that I just support political candidates because of the business.</p><p>Money is not the motivating force.

I&#39;m like, &#39;No, families mess up kids!&#39; I grew up in Hollywood, and I&#39;m perfectly fine. If my children want to go into the entertainment business, I won&#39;t stop them, as long as they&#39;re passionate about it.</p><p>The Internet creates as well as destroys. Social networks, search advertising, and cloud computing are multibillion dollar industries that didn&#39;t exist 10 years ago. They are products of the same force that has rendered the Postal Service&#39;s core business obsolete.</p><p>If you create something that is asking for people to respond as they&#39;re going to respond, you have to allow them to respond as they&#39;re going to respond. Some of the people are going to be uninterested and some people are going to be mad for some reason, which is their business. That&#39;s just the way the world is.</p><p>Energy and environmental regulation, transportation, and broadband policy all benefit when legislators have a basic grounding in the technical concepts behind business models, products, and innovation.</p><p>If you say, &#39;I&#39;m going to cut this song because I know the teenagers are going to love it,&#39; well, then you&#39;re going to alienate everybody else. When I cut my record, I&#39;m just going to cut the things that I like, and whoever likes it, likes it. That&#39;s too much work to try to figure out the demographic. That&#39;s too much like a business.</p><p>Barack Obama&#39;s life was so much simpler in 2009. Back then, he had refined the cold act of blaming others for the bad economy into an art form. Deficits? Blame Bush&#39;s tax cuts. Spending? Blame the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. No business investment? Blame Wall Street.</p><p>In the music business, especially the country music business, every 10 years or so you&#39;re going to have this changing of the guard, this wave of new artists that comes in.</p><p>I&#39;ve got a wife, four kids, a business, and a baseball career.</p><p>A firm, for instance, that does business in many countries of the world is driven to spend an enormous amount of time, labour, and money in providing for translation services.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to be the best in the world as a baseball player, so when I started to think about opening a business, it was with that mindset.</p><p>Love, with very young people, is a heartless business. We drink at that age from thirst, or to get drunk it is only later in life that we occupy ourselves with the individuality of our wine.</p><p>I&#39;m lucky. The best possible place in the world for training is Addis Ababa, so I am home all the time except when I am racing. I like to be there, near my family, my kids, also the real estate business I run with my wife.</p><p>If you want to stay in the business then you&#39;ve got to be a bit shrewd, haven&#39;t you?</p><p>I find the business world hard.</p><p>As an actor you have to wait for someone to cast you, so you&#39;re relying on the business.</p><p>I can&#39;t understand why the Democratic parties seem so hostile to economic growth and business.</p><p>Kids are brought into show business because they are cute and see truth and they&#39;re very bright. But there&#39;s a sense of doing it because you want the adults to be approving of you. You want to make them happy.</p><p>Show business is my life. When I was a kid I sold insurance, but nobody laughed.</p><p>Go for a business that any idiot can run - because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it.</p><p>If you want to have a good life, you should focus on your family, on your business, on your dog, on your fun, and you&#39;ll have a good life.</p><p>All business proceeds on beliefs, or judgements of probabilities, and not on certainties.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have any success in show business until I was 30 to 31 years of age.</p><p>These women whose antics we smirk at good-naturedly in the pap-traps put themselves out there at least partly on their beauty they are in showbiz, and showing what they&#39;ve got is part of their business as much as it is for male show-ponies from the Chippendales to George Clooney.</p><p>Politics is the reflex of the business and industrial world.</p><p>Performing doesn&#39;t turn me on. It&#39;s an egomaniac business, filled with prima donnas - including this one.</p><p>We are involved in a life that passes understanding and our highest business is our daily life.</p><p>I&#39;ve never seen a worse situation than that of young writers in the United States. The publishing business in North America is so commercialized.</p><p>I have several writer friends, but I don&#39;t involve them in my work process. I&#39;m more likely to talk about the business of publishing with them.</p><p>It never made sense to me that someone would achieve any kind of success in show business, only to become a jerk.</p><p>I may be kindly, I am ordinarily gentle, but in my line of business I am obliged to will terribly what I will at all.</p><p>Major labels didn&#39;t start showing up really until they smelled money, and that&#39;s all they&#39;re ever going to be attracted to is money-that&#39;s the business they&#39;re in- making money.</p><p>There has to be a measure of faith. That&#39;s what this business is all about: trusting in something that may never show up, that you have no concrete proof of.</p><p>For a Jewish Puritan of the middle class, the novel is serious, the novel is work, the novel is conscientious application why, the novel is practically the retail business all over again.</p><p>Why do only boys get to chase? Nuh-uh! If anything, I think this whole sitting back and waiting thing can be self-sabotaging. We have to send up flares. We have to let guys know we&#39;re open for business.</p><p>To be honest I live among the English and have always found them to be very honest in their business dealings. They are noble, hard-working and anxious to do the right thing. But joy eludes them, they lack the joy that the Irish have.</p><p>In terms of having a business, I wanted to let it go beyond what my personal taste is. Basically, I&#39;m in a kilt and a white shirt every day. So, you know, I don&#39;t have a lot of scope, and I&#39;m really picky about what I wear.</p><p>The owners don&#39;t win by having a lockout. Shutting down your business is not good for anybody and it&#39;s certainly not good for the players, it&#39;s certainly not good for the fans. And that&#39;s most important to us.</p><p>What if I couldn&#39;t handle people&#39;s opinions of me? I know that shouldn&#39;t dictate a person&#39;s degree of peace or happiness in life, but the problem is, I chose a business saturated in judgment.</p><p>I got to work with one of my heroes, Johnny Depp, and to see how he goes about business, which was really inspiring for me at this stage in my career.</p><p>Just because you&#39;ve made a couple movies, you&#39;ve done some good movies, you&#39;ve been nominated for some Academy Awards, whatever, nobody&#39;s entitled. It&#39;s a business. If they don&#39;t see it, I can think they&#39;re wrong, but I&#39;m not entitled to a $15 million budget to make a film.</p><p>I think that New York is not the cultural centre of America, but the business and administrative centre of American culture.</p><p>Emotions have no place in business, unless you do business with them.</p><p>How many deaf people do you know in real life? Unless they live in a cave, or are 14, which seems to be true for most people in this business, what could I possibly tell them that they don&#39;t already know?</p><p>Profit is the most global aspect of a business, and it is cross-functional.</p><p>I think naturally, if you&#39;re an actor, there&#39;s a high level of assertiveness that you need to have to survive this business. There&#39;s boldness in being assertive, and there&#39;s strength and confidence.</p><p>The TV business is like the produce section of the market. Today everything is fresh and glistening and firm. And tomorrow, when they find a bruise on you, they toss you out.</p><p>I&#39;ve managed to keep a clear head and remain sane in this business because I remain a kid off-camera.</p><p>Some people work hard in this business and become really popular, really big stars but they never receive an award from within the business.

Those things interest them more than humanity and I wish them the best of luck.</p><p>I don&#39;t even know what words to use to talk about the music industry anymore. But the business has changed a lot - the methods of releasing music.</p><p>Independent film is almost nonexistent right now, because all the distributers that used to love to put out these little art films are all out of business right now, because it costs so much to open a movie.</p><p>I&#39;m quitting the business today. I&#39;m going to open up an appliance store, I&#39;ve always really been into toasters. I&#39;m giving it all up.</p><p>I know from my own experience and from other people in the business that when you come from a place where nobody knew who you were and then there is this sudden shift to where everybody now knows who you are, there&#39;s an adjustment that you have to make.</p><p>I used to be focused on being the dopest rapper in the game, and then once that became what I was, I wanted something different, and I wanted to become the best businessman in the game. I wanted to learn how to master the business like I mastered the rap.</p><p>A revised schedule is to business what a new season is to an athlete or a new canvas to an artist.</p><p>The most important decision I&#39;ve made in business? The choices of people I have around me. When I first started I brought everybody with me, my homies from the neighborhood, criminals. I just said, &#39;Come on everybody, we made it.&#39; Then I had to realize we didn&#39;t make it. I made it.</p><p>Most small business owners are not particularly sophisticated business people. That&#39;s not a criticism they&#39;re passionate about cutting hair or cooking food, and that&#39;s why they got in the business, not because they have an MBA.</p><p>Luckily, my husband is my business partner as well as my life partner, so I never had to do the heavy lifting alone, literally or figuratively.</p><p>You have to stick out the toughness of the business and form relationships with the people in it.</p><p>Come to West Virginia and we&#39;ll show you how to live... how to treat people. We&#39;re open for business. West Virginia is truly on the move.</p><p>It&#39;s far too much to say that effective hoping is the only - or even the biggest - part of what it takes to succeed. If 14% of business productivity can be attributed to hope, that means 86% is dependent on raw talent, fickle business cycles, the quality of the product you&#39;re selling, and often pure, dumb luck.</p><p>It is not the business of generals to shoot one another.</p><p>Golf isn&#39;t just my business, it&#39;s my hobby.</p><p>I do love television. But the business is accelerating and people are not getting the chance to fail.</p><p>It&#39;s show business. No show, no business.</p><p>If we want to secure the best jobs in the future, we must make America the best place in the world to do business.</p><p>We need comprehensive reform that will make America the best place in the world to invest and do business.</p><p>When you start a business, go for the lowest hanging fruit.</p><p>Well there&#39;s nobody who has a more supportive husband than I do, and he has a business that he runs, and it&#39;s his own business, so he has work to do, my kids have school to do, I mean, people have - there are other things in life besides politics.</p><p>I&#39;m happy to report that &#39;The New Press&#39; is still in business to this day. But not thanks to me. I was a really bad publishing intern.</p><p>The thing that helped me get into the film business was that I went to school in Athens, Georgia and managed to get on, um, working on music videos for a band called R.E.M. and that kind of opened up a lot of doors for me.</p><p>I&#39;ve drunk Amazon&#39;s free Diet Coke. Nothing makes more sense to me than a company trying to make bookselling into a profitable business. I&#39;m not anti-Amazon, and I&#39;m not pro-publishers either. I&#39;m pro-books.</p><p>Some people want fame, popularity and huge sales. I&#39;ve always hoped to have a really long career. So I&#39;ve tried to make each of my creative decisions and business decisions to allow for longevity. As a side effect I got really famous and really big. I didn&#39;t realize the two could go together.</p><p>Seems to me that this business, for actors anyway, is not so much about whether or not you do good work. It&#39;s about whether or not you get the chance to do good work.</p><p>In my business, if I get too close to you and you die, it hurts me. And so you develop a natural inclination not to be close to the patient, so that if things don&#39;t work out ideally, you can still get up the next day and care for the next patient.</p><p>I&#39;d like to do a lot of things - whether in design or architecture or business.</p><p>My fastest time in high school was a 4:29 mile. I think cross-country has something to do with my longevity in my business. When you&#39;re in an eight-mile race, you never give up.</p><p>If I could create one job in the private sector by helping to grow a business, that would be one more than Congress has created in the last six months.</p><p>Our marriage is between us. If we decide to continue being together or not, it&#39;s our business.</p><p>The movie business is very difficult but the music business is just impossible. So I&#39;ll play in bands and record and play songs with other people, but for me it&#39;s a form of expression that all I need is me. I don&#39;t need cameras or agents, I can just have a piano and sing and feel totally verified.</p><p>I don&#39;t really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who I feel I want to spar with.</p><p>I was always a singer. But I was always focused on being an actor as my trade. Music I do just for me. The movie business is very difficult but the music business is just impossible.</p><p>In recent years, I&#39;ve been writing because I&#39;m fortunate enough to work in the world of food television, to travel and taste and learn about cooking from the best chefs in the business.</p><p>I was criticized at some level within the Republican Party by those who say government should not be in the economic development business at all. My response is that the only country I know that doesn&#39;t have an economic development plan is Papa New Guinea.</p><p>The rest of the world cares about how we conduct our affairs because they then take that lead. We&#39;re the only leader in the world today. Some are wishing us well, others think that we&#39;re down and are not going to get back up again, but they are all watching with great interest to see how we conduct our business over the next couple of years.</p><p>Although my family - parents and sister - all work in the personnel management business, their real passion is performing, amateur operatic societies and so on.</p><p>I would absolutely, definitely never sell my wedding pictures to a magazine. I&#39;d like it to be a special day, not a photo shoot. And once you&#39;ve done that, your marriage becomes everybody else&#39;s business.</p><p>Every night, half an hour before curtain up, the bells of St. Malachy&#39;s, the Actors&#39; Chapel on New York&#39;s 49th Street, peal the tune of &#39;There&#39;s No Business Like Show Business.&#39; If you walk the streets of the theatre district before a show and see the vast, enthusiastic lines it sounds like a calling: there is certainly no place like Broadway.</p><p>Writing fiction is for me a fraught business, an occasion of daily dread for at least the first half of the novel, and sometimes all the way through. The work process is totally different from writing nonfiction. You have to sit down every day and make it up.</p><p>I was a fairly good amateur musician, and I was an average professional. But the one thing I saw was that the big band business was fading.</p><p>I mean, I&#39;m in the business of storytelling, not message making.</p><p>Well, you can&#39;t trust most people in this game, period it can be a very shady business.</p><p>A transfer of money should never be involved in this profound situation. Although illness is profound, too, but medicine&#39;s a business today. It&#39;s a business.</p><p>Today it is not big business that we have to fear. It is big government.</p><p>After adding trillions to the debt on big-government policies most Americans didn&#39;t ask for and which we couldn&#39;t afford, Democratic leaders say they need more money, which they intend to take from small business, even though small businesses create the majority of new jobs.</p><p>I learned from Mr. Wrigley, early in my career, that loyalty wins and it creates friendships. I saw it work for him in his business.</p><p>Business is constantly changing, constantly evolving.</p><p>I don&#39;t do something necessarily to make a big profit or because it&#39;s a logical business decision.</p><p>We expect all our businesses to have a positive impact on our top and bottom lines. Profitability is very important to us or we wouldn&#39;t be in this business.</p><p>The only thing harder than leaving show business is coming back.</p><p>If you don&#39;t understand the details of your business you are going to fail.</p><p>Anybody who really knows about the TV business knows that it would be impossible to just march in one day and say to your colleagues and bosses, &#39;Oh yes, I&#39;m hosting my own show.&#39;</p><p>We have to make America the best place in the world to do business.</p><p>My professional life has been a constant record of disillusion, and many things that seem wonderful to most men are the every-day commonplaces of my business.</p><p>I used to work for a management consulting company, so I dressed differently - business casual, probably a lot of things from Banana Republic. My wardrobe now is definitely more expensive, but I always dress for the occasion.</p><p>It is very sad for a man to make himself servant to a single thing his manhood all taken out of him by the hydraulic pressure of excessive business.</p><p>But now I realize that this record business really needs me. No one else is trying to take a chance or do something different.</p><p>In terms of the technology I use the most, it&#39;s probably a tie between my Blackberry and my MacBook Pro laptop. That&#39;s how I communicate with the rest of the world and how I handle all the business I have to handle.</p><p>I&#39;ve never chased fame. I came into this business to be a theatre actress. I was nine when I first appeared on stage. But I can&#39;t say I would turn my back on fortune. I&#39;m someone who enjoys the benefits of money.</p><p>At the end of the day, there&#39;s only a few major stars in the music business, and then there&#39;s all these people that are aspiring to be that.</p><p>I&#39;d get kicked out of buildings all day long, people would rip up my business card in my face. It&#39;s a humbling business to be in. But I knew I could sell and I knew I wanted to sell something I had created. I cut the feet out of those pantyhose and I knew I was on to something. This was it.</p><p>People in the business will stay with you through drugs and alcohol and divorces and insanity and everything else, but you have a failure, pal, and they don&#39;t want to know nothing about you!</p><p>My revenue was $4 million my first year in business, off of one $20 item.</p><p>My business doesn&#39;t keep me warm at night.</p><p>I&#39;ve always leaned toward a feminine, funky style, even in business settings. I used to paint my nails blue in 1993, before it was mainstream.</p><p>I have always been a business person.</p><p>You can never get to a place of comfort in this business. As soon as you hit that little cushy spot, somebody&#39;s gonna kick you out. So I have a constant need to do it better.</p><p>I went onto reality TV as a business decision.</p><p>The Internet has changed the way we communicate with each other, the way we learn about the world and the way we conduct business.</p><p>In the end, the humanities can only be defended by stressing how indispensable they are and this means insisting on their vital role in the whole business of academic learning, rather than protesting that, like some poor relation, they don&#39;t cost much to be housed.</p><p>As Members of Congress we can now engage with our constituents via online innovations like the Huffington Post, while a small business in rural Oregon can use the Internet to find customers around the world.</p><p>I really don&#39;t think there is anybody in the business with better eyes than Elijah Wood.</p><p>Like any business, the oil industry runs on the basic premise of supply and demand. The more supply - the lower the price. The higher the demand - the higher price. In other words, the more people who can buy oil, the higher the price of oil.</p><p>Accept business only at a price permitting thoroughness. Then do a thorough job, regardless of cost to us.</p><p>I am especially grateful that I have been able to keep my own style over the decades, in spite of the many changes that have taken place in the world of fashion and in its business.</p><p>If you&#39;re an entrepreneur and you think that the president makes a difference to your business, you should stay at your current job.</p><p>It is an immutable law in business that words are words, explanations are explanations, promises are promises-but only performance is reality.</p><p>It&#39;s better to take over and build upon an existing business than to start a new one.</p><p>You can&#39;t run a business or anything else on a theory.</p><p>I could play it safe by recording songs that are familiar, but am I expanding myself as an artist by doing covers? It&#39;s a catch-22. It&#39;s called show business: The word &#39;business&#39; is in it, and you&#39;ve got to be a businessman. But then again, you have to be true to yourself as an artist.</p><p>The worst disease which can afflict business executives in their work is not, as popularly supposed, alcoholism it&#39;s egotism.</p><p>It&#39;s a lot of work to keep reinventing yourself and coming up with new stuff, but that&#39;s what it takes to be in show business.</p><p>To me, the print business model is so simple, where readers pay a dollar for all the content within, and that supports the enterprise.</p><p>A belief in God is vitally important, not just in show business, but stability in life. You know, to recognize deity is the most important thing that you can do. I mean, it comes to the Ten Commandments. They weren&#39;t ten suggestions. They were Ten Commandments.</p><p>McSweeney&#39;s as a publishing company is built on a business model that only works when we sell physical books. So we try to put a lot of effort into the design and production of the book-as-object.</p><p>Our competition for American business is no longer in the next county or the next state, it&#39;s around the world.</p><p>Of course this is Vegas and it is the melting pot for all over the world, but people from all over the world know Donny and Marie. It is amazing. I have been in the business a long time to realize careers can be fleeting. Five years is a long career nowadays for some people, and here we are still going strong after 40 years.</p><p>If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25 cars that got 1,000 MPG.</p><p>There was a time in my life when I thought I had everything - millions of dollars, mansions, cars, nice clothes, beautiful women, and every other materialistic thing you can imagine. Now I struggle for peace.</p><p>Car designers are just going to have to come up with an automobile that outlasts the payments.</p><p>I hooked up my accelerator pedal in my car to my brake lights.

You never see further than your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.</p><p>If all the cars in the United States were placed end to end, it would probably be Labor Day Weekend.</p><p>I had more clothes than I had closets, more cars than garage space, but no money.</p><p>Drive-in banks were established so most of the cars today could see their real owners.</p><p>I would have probably stolen cars - it would have given me the same adrenaline rush as racing.</p><p>I never rode in an automobile until I was 12.</p><p>My boyfriend keeps telling me I&#39;ve got to own things. So, first I bought this car. And then he told me I oughta get a house. &#39;Why a house?&#39; &#39;Well, you gotta have a place to park the car.&#39;</p><p>Americans are the only people in the world known to me whose status anxiety prompts them to advertise their college and university affiliations in the rear window of their automobiles.</p><p>When it comes to cars, only two varieties of people are possible - cowards and fools.</p><p>In Japan, they have TV sets in cars right now, where you can punch up traffic routes, weather, everything! You can get Internet access already in cars in Japan, so within the next 2 to 3 years it&#39;s gonna be so crazy!</p><p>Perhaps people, and kids especially, are spoiled today, because all the kids today have cars, it seems. When I was young you were lucky to have a bike.</p><p>But my passion is racing cars. It&#39;s what I like to do in my off time.</p><p>My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance.</p><p>But to personally satisfy my own adrenalin needs, I&#39;ve been racing cars a little bit, which has been fun.</p><p>I have a need to make these sorts of connections literal sometimes, and a vehicle often helps to do that. I have a relationship to car culture. It isn&#39;t really about loving cars. It&#39;s sort of about needing them.</p><p>There&#39;s three things men always talk about - women, sports, and cars.</p><p>The automobile engine will come, and then I will consider my life&#39;s work complete.</p><p>I think we have to act like stars because it is expected of us. So we drive our big cars and live in our smart houses.</p><p>We need to become good citizens in the global village, instead of competing. What are we competing for - to drive more cars, eat more steaks? That will destroy the world.</p><p>I love fast cars... and to go too fast in them.</p><p>We&#39;re just into toys, whether it&#39;s motorcycles or race cars or computers. I&#39;ve got the Palm Pilot right here with me, I&#39;ve got the world&#39;s smallest phone. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m still a big little kid and I just love toys, you know?</p><p>I would never kill a living thing, although I probably have inadvertently while driving automobiles.</p><p>See, what you&#39;re meant to do when you have a mid-life crisis is buy a fast car, aren&#39;t you? Well, I&#39;ve always had fast cars. It&#39;s not that. It&#39;s the fear that you&#39;re past your best. It&#39;s the fear that the stuff you&#39;ve done in the past is your best work.</p><p>Back in the mid-1970s, we adopted some fairly ambitious goals to improve efficiency of our cars. What did we get? We got a tremendous boost in efficiency.</p><p>You have to wait six months to purchase a fuel efficient automobile made from overseas.</p><p>I had never been able to get a car that said how much I cared about the environment until I drove electric.</p><p>Fast cars are my only vice.</p><p>Family trips to Yellowstone and to what are now national parks in Southern Utah, driving the primitive roads and cars of that day, were real adventures.</p><p>I&#39;ve got two old Volvos, two old Subarus, and an old Ford Ranger.

But I&#39;m still trying to work out how to operate the air conditioning unit on my car.</p><p>I never listen to the radio unless I rent a car.</p><p>You can know or not know how a car runs and still enjoy riding in a car.</p><p>I don&#39;t listen to the radio very much, but that could be because I don&#39;t have a car.</p><p>There&#39;s a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling: you&#39;re self-propelled and decide exactly where to go.

You put her in a rental car, and she&#39;s doing doughnuts in the K-Mart parking lot!</p><p>I accept the Old Testament as more of an action movie: blood, car chases, evacuations, a lot of special effects, seas dividing, mass murder, adultery.

Buy cars and other products that have the least impact environmentally.</p><p>Once you become successful, people know where you live, the type of house you live in, the kind of car you drive, the clothes you wear, and so it would be patronising to go and talk like a welder.

But as with physical pain, fiscal pain can depend on the individual, and everyone has a different threshold.</p><p>I think I&#39;m actually quite a materialistic person, I value what it takes to make a car or build a nice house. Money does change things, but how it changes people depends on how they react to it.</p><p>Sometimes I wish I could drive a car, but I&#39;m gonna drive a car one day, so I don&#39;t worry about that.</p><p>The year most of my high school friends and I got our driver&#39;s permits, the coolest thing one could do was stand outside after school and twirl one&#39;s car keys like a lifeguard whistle. That jingling sound meant freedom and power.</p><p>The lead car is unique, except for the one behind it which is identical.</p><p>Either the car is stationary, or it&#39;s on the move.</p><p>I&#39;m a car fanatic and each morning I wake up with a smile on my face, whether I&#39;m commentating on the Formula One or at Silver Hatch racetrack in Roary the Racing Car.</p><p>I am so sick of reading about another car bomb, another suicide bomber, another 10, 20, 30, 70, 100 people dead in a day, both Americans and Iraqis.</p><p>Police departments no longer have to pay overtime or divert resources from other projects to find out where an individual goes - all they have to do is place a tracking device on someone&#39;s car or ask a cell phone company for that individual&#39;s location history and the technology does the work for them.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been a bit of a car freak.</p><p>Over my lifetime, the car had actually transcended the fact that it is a car. It has become a venue.</p><p>It was 100 feet of 16 mm black-and-white film of a car coming to a stop sign, and driving off. I had to decide how to frame and light it. It was magic. There was a sense of mystery.</p><p>Stay humble. Always answer your phone - no matter who else is in the car.</p><p>One morning, about four o&#39;clock, I was driving my car just about as fast as I could. I thought, Why am I out this time of night? I was miserable, and it came to me: I&#39;m falling in love with somebody I have no right to fall in love with.</p><p>I enjoy racing historic motorcars from the &#39;50s and &#39;60s. The seed of my interest was planted when I was about 12 years old and took over my mother&#39;s Morris Minor. I drove it around my father&#39;s farm. But my favorite car is still a McLaren F1, which I have had for 10 years.</p><p>When you put gas in your car you are making a political statement, because you are supporting the empires that control and continue the destruction of some countries.</p><p>A suburban mother&#39;s role is to deliver children obstetrically once, and by car forever after.</p><p>A muscle is like a car. If you want it to run well early in the morning, you have to warm it up.</p><p>It&#39;s like, it&#39;s kind of like if you ever had a car and it was a bit of a clunker but you love it, that&#39;s my show. It&#39;s a bit of a clunker but I know where everything is and I like it.</p><p>When I was really little I would sit in the back of my dad&#39;s car when he&#39;d be playing old-school music. He&#39;d turn down the music and turn around and I&#39;d be singing and know all of the words but I didn&#39;t even know how to talk. From then on I&#39;ve always wanted to be a singer.</p><p>Sometimes, when my wife and I were going out to dinner, I would take my laptop with me and work in the car, so as to take advantage of the half hour going and coming.</p><p>I&#39;ve got Asperger&#39;s syndrome and I&#39;m not a very good people person, so I&#39;ve always been more comfortable around machinery. Not in a weird way - I don&#39;t want to marry my car or anything stupid like that!</p><p>Okay, let&#39;s talk about cartoon labels for half a second - some people think anything with a dog or a car or a colorful alien is garbage, which is not true. Look at Big Moose Red. It&#39;s, like, a $6 wine with a cheesy label, and it&#39;s actually a solid wine.</p><p>My mother is a big believer in being responsible for your own happiness. She always talked about finding joy in small moments and insisted that we stop and take in the beauty of an ordinary day. When I stop the car to make my kids really see a sunset, I hear my mother&#39;s voice and smile.</p><p>I dated a guy and he liked me but I didn&#39;t like him. I went through his wardrobe and cleaned out his house and got him to get a new car. He said to me, &#39;If I give you $10,000, will you find me my wife because I want someone like you?&#39; And within a year, he got married. That was the first match that led to me leaving my corporate job.</p><p>I&#39;m lucky because my dad taught me to be frugal and save. And that&#39;s important because I want to know that I don&#39;t have to take an acting job for two or three years if I don&#39;t want to and that I&#39;ll still be able to make my house and car payments and buy food for my dogs.</p><p>There are certain times I don&#39;t want my picture taken. If my wife&#39;s stepping out of a car and it looks like it&#39;s going to come out an indecent picture, don&#39;t I have a right to object?</p><p>I mean, you&#39;ve kind of got the track down, especially with ovals. The only thing that improves is that when race conditions come, you know what to expect slightly more from the track and from your car.</p><p>I think that Indy is special to me. The greater the distance between the last time I drove an Indy car and the next time, I wouldn&#39;t like that to be too big.</p><p>On Memorial Day, I was out floating on Lake Norman and came across Denny Hamlin. We struck up a conversation, and one of the first things we were talking about was how much it helped him when he started racing the Cup car and how much it helped his Nationwide program.</p><p>Every time I get into a Nationwide car after being in a Cup car, I feel so much more comfortable than I did previously.</p><p>No matter how good you are, how brave you are or anything, it comes down to that car so many times. Not every time, but so many times.</p><p>I&#39;m a big believer in everybody being themselves. If not doing a swimsuit calendar is yourself, that&#39;s great. But if doing a swimsuit calendar is yourself, then you should be able to do it. What I do outside the car adds to who I am and expresses a different side of me.</p><p>I think women like Ferraris. A Ferrari is everybody&#39;s car.</p><p>Freedom is not an ideal, it is not even a protection, if it means nothing more than freedom to stagnate, to live without dreams, to have no greater aim than a second car and another television set.</p><p>I started rapping before anybody had ever bought a car from it. It was truly about the art form and the culture, more so than now, where it&#39;s a successful way to make money. Back then you had to be doing it because you liked it.</p><p>Austin sounds a little bit like Aston Martin, which is the type of car James Bond would drive.</p><p>Racism has been for everyone like a horrible, tragic car crash, and we&#39;ve all been heavily sedated from it. If we don&#39;t come into consciousness of this tragedy, there&#39;s going to be a violent awakening we don&#39;t want. The question is, can we wake up?</p><p>It was my father who instilled the &#39;never say no&#39; attitude I carry around with me today, and who instilled in me a sense of wonder, always taking us on adventures in the car, never telling us the destination.</p><p>I did this Super-8 film at art school called &#39;Tissues,&#39; this black comedy about a family whose father has been arrested for child molestation. I was absolutely thrilled by every inch of it, and would throw my projector in the back of my car and show it to anybody who would watch it.</p><p>The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world, about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home? How can I pay for a new car? Are immigrants taking away my white world?</p><p>By the time the children go to bed, I am as drained as any mother who has spent her day working, car pooling, building Lego castles and shopping for the precisely correct soccer cleat.</p><p>I think we&#39;ve been dulled by capitalism. We&#39;re just blobs now - we&#39;re so worried about how we can keep paying the lease on the car, the mortgage, the lease on the toaster and all that. You can&#39;t really think about much else. If you lose that, you lose the whole lot.</p><p>Before now, I&#39;ve always taken my mixes out to the car and listened to them in the parking lot. I still do that, but more so now I&#39;m listening to it on the Beat box, and I think people should give it at least a listen and check it out and see what it is.</p><p>I like structure - like driving: go past the school on the street, stay on the right side, no hitting the car, go in right, you&#39;ll see a big church, stop and take a left, and you&#39;ll have it. By doing this I&#39;m giving a structure of life, a path of light, and showing what happens between me and me, which is something very beautiful.</p><p>I&#39;d kind of like to have a classic old muscle car. I think that would be fun.</p><p>Once I accepted Christ I immediately had peace. I still didn&#39;t have a place to live, I still didn&#39;t have a car, but I had peace.</p><p>When I was a kid I got busted for throwing a rock through a car window and egging a house on halloween.</p><p>Sometimes movie-making happens like clockwork other times, like a car accident.</p><p>I don&#39;t put myself on Jeff Beck&#39;s level, but I can relate to him when he says he&#39;d rather be working on his car collection than playing the guitar.</p><p>The thing people don&#39;t understand is that touring or travelling or whatever you do in my position means you go to all these cool places all over the world, but you see everything from a car window. You don&#39;t get to see much of the city or meet people at all.</p><p>I&#39;m just attracted to playing people who are ostensible unlikable. That&#39;s not to say that there&#39;s something in there that makes you care. It might be that you just find them so awful that you just can&#39;t stop watching, like a car crash.</p><p>I like to put on hardcore when I have to clean my apartment, which I hate to do, but it&#39;s motivational. I like old heavy metal when I&#39;m outside working on my car. Music has definite functions for me.</p><p>I don&#39;t actually own a car.</p><p>The only thing I do on a computer is play Texas Hold &#39;Em, really. Obviously my cell phone is a computer. My car is a computer. I&#39;m on computers every day without actively seeking them out.</p><p>Johnny Guitar... just one of my favorite singers of all time. I met him when we were both on the road with Johnny Otis in the &#39;50s when I was a teenager. We traveled the country in a car together.I would hear him sing every night.</p><p>But I have a driver, so I can return calls while I&#39;m in the car.</p><p>L.A. has a fantastic car scene and because the climate is so gentle, cars can last forever.</p><p>I&#39;d really like to get the girl, shoot the gun, drive the car, have fun. I even have these kind of action dreams, where I&#39;m the action guy.</p><p>I was raised in Chicago and I guess that was one of the special breeding grounds for gangsters of all colors. That was the Detroit of the gangster world. The car industry was thugs.</p><p>I sing in the car if I&#39;m in LA, because you&#39;re like soundproofed.</p><p>We had the guys from X Men 2 do the cameras. They had a 360 camera that would go from one car, up in the air and over to another car in a continuous shot while the film was still rolling, going 90 mph.</p><p>In New York, you&#39;ve got Donald Trump, Woody Allen, a crack addict and a regular Joe, and they&#39;re all on the same subway car.</p><p>I was turning 20 during my first record. Those decade birthdays always kind of cause me, it seems, to reflect, look back, and then look forward. I just was closing this period of my life where I was living in a car and scrambling my whole life to then signing a six-record deal with Atlantic.</p><p>In addition to this, they already have a fuel cell car on the road in Japan. It is subsidized from within the corporation because they are still at a high cost.</p><p>Toyota was the first to put a commercial fuel cell powered car on the road, and I have no doubt that Toyota will continue to be in the front lines in the development of competitive fuel cell vehicles.</p><p>I borrowed my friend&#39;s car the other day in an attempt to persuade my husband that we needed a car and literally this is true, in the first day of borrowing the car, I got three tickets and I rear-ended it.</p><p>I used to look like a deer in headlights on the red carpet. You step out of the car and it&#39;s bedlam. Everyone&#39;s got crazy eyes.</p><p>Well, I&#39;ve been in a few car wrecks.</p><p>I don&#39;t want a flashy car, just something that would allow me to stop using the Tube. And it would be good not to have to rely on my mum all the time, particularly when I have to listen to her singing in her car.</p><p>When you read about a car crash in which two or three youngsters are killed, do you pause to dwell on the amount of love and treasure and patience parents poured into bodies no longer suitable for open caskets?</p><p>A life can get knocked into a new orbit by a car crash, a lottery win or just a bleary-eyed consultant giving bad news in a calm voice.</p><p>Home, nowadays, is a place where part of the family waits till the rest of the family brings the car back.</p><p>With all the hybrid stuff and things like that, I think that&#39;s a fabulous direction to go with cars in that sense. As someone who grew up around muscle cars, I&#39;ll never not be able to not love a muscle car. Not that I don&#39;t care about the environment, that&#39;s not it. But I adore muscle cars.</p><p>I don&#39;t even own a car.</p><p>Of course, I&#39;m older now. I&#39;m in a different place in my life than when I wrote the songs for &#39;Car Wheels&#39; or &#39;Essence&#39; or whatever. Different things were going on.</p><p>I hate fishing, and I can&#39;t imagine why anyone would want to hike when you can get in the car and drive.</p><p>I would make tea for Joni Mitchell or clean her car, anything to be in the studio and watch her work.</p><p>If any demonstrator ever lays down in front of my car, it&#39;ll be the last car he&#39;ll ever lay down in front of.</p><p>I am endlessly busy, bringing up five young kids, and trying to keep up with the three older ones. I still spend most of my life driving car pools.</p><p>Yes, I did and a lot of my friends who are in the same program as I were very much supportive, and the most important thing they said to me is do not let this interfere with what you have to do in taking car of yourself. That was the most important thing.</p><p>I read murder mysteries. I exercise 40 minutes a day. I watch videotapes while I exercise. I listen to audiotapes when I am in my car. And I try to stay in three different centuries.</p><p>People don&#39;t understand that it was maybe my biggest pleasure to drive an F1 car when it&#39;s wet.</p><p>The people who criticise you will not be the ones taking care of your legs when you are in your wheelchair. People who never drove a car in these conditions, they just don&#39;t know.</p><p>When you&#39;re in a car which can win every race, or fight for a win every race, that is pressure.</p><p>We go through the whole season working on next season&#39;s car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff. And we obviously give ideas of what we would hope next year&#39;s car would have even if it&#39;s small things like buttons on the steering wheel and different positions and whatever.</p><p>We all drive differently and have different styles. For me I need a car I can develop beneath me and feel comfortable in. If the car feels neutral and unbalanced it doesn&#39;t work for me.</p><p>I need to develop a car and engineer a car in a position that feels comfortable for me, and I don&#39;t think anyone can do a better job than I can in that position. The problem for me is if I can&#39;t get the car there I do struggle more than some.</p><p>To understand the intensity of driving an F1 car, you have to be in it. When you&#39;re driving a 750hp machine at 200mph, the noise and the vibrations are incredible. The G-force when you take big corners is like someone trying to rip your head off. You hit the brakes, and it feels as if the skin is being pulled off your body.</p><p>To drive an F1 car you have to be a little mad. On the morning of a race there&#39;s a mix of excitement and fear. If it&#39;s a wet track, then it&#39;s worse as you&#39;re not in control most of the time, which is the thing all drivers fear the most.</p><p>When I do retire, I know for a fact that I&#39;ll never be able to replace the incredible feeling I get when I&#39;m driving an F1 car.</p><p>In the car and in front of the camera I tend to be very calm but behind the scenes I can get fired up and passionate, I just don&#39;t see the need to shout my mouth off in public.</p><p>I don&#39;t purposely speed, but I might go over by five or six miles an hour from time to time. It doesn&#39;t give me a buzz driving on normal roads, because I can&#39;t go fast enough. It&#39;s never going to be anything like an F1 car.</p><p>The fast, flowing parts, the high-speed corners, that&#39;s where a Formula One car is at its best - changes of direction, pulling high g-forces left and right.</p><p>A lot of people think Formula One isn&#39;t a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning. But we&#39;re pulling up to six G on a corner or during breaking, which is almost like being a fighter pilot. So we have to do a lot of work on our neck muscles.</p><p>I keep my weight low, although you need to be able to move your weight around the race car to change the balance. I&#39;m 6ft and I&#39;m 70kg so I haven&#39;t much fat on me.</p><p>You&#39;re pulling 4-5G for a lot of the corners around the lap. We build up lactic acid because there are a lot of vibrations in the car, and you have to have strong legs to hit the brake pedal. We need to be fit to do every lap at 100%.</p><p>When you&#39;re doing a TV show, it&#39;s not like you just shoot for six weeks and you&#39;re in an editing room with all of your footage. It&#39;s like a guitar or a car, you have to fine tune things. You stop doing what&#39;s not working, you work on what is working and you add things that do work.</p><p>Television is such an evolving medium. When you&#39;re doing a TV show, it&#39;s not like you just shoot for six weeks and you&#39;re in an editing room with all of your footage. It&#39;s like a guitar or a car, you have to fine tune things. You stop doing what&#39;s not working, you work on what is working and you add things that do work.</p><p>If your goal is to be the biggest movie star in the world, a 10-movie contract is gold. It was never my goal. Up until now, I made movies - and I have a nice house, a nice car. I&#39;m fortunate, happy and grateful. Life is good.</p><p>It&#39;s that I don&#39;t like white paper backgrounds. A woman does not live in front of white paper. She lives on the street, in a motor car, in a hotel room.</p><p>Most of us would never consider getting our car repaired without first receiving an estimate of the charges, but this is exactly what we do when we need to go to a hospital for treatment.</p><p>My very best friend died in a car accident when I was 16 years old. That was the hardest blow emotionally that I have ever had to endure. Suddenly, you realize tomorrow might not come. Now I live by the motto, &#39;Today is what I have.&#39;</p><p>I grew up in Texas, and people love their American-made muscle cars there. I grew up around people who loved cars and took care of cars and my dad&#39;s a big car nut, so I learned a little bit about cars - how to love them, most importantly. I think that from the time I could remember, I&#39;ve always envisioned myself in a vintage muscle car.</p><p>We talked about many issues, like welfare, is it the way of life or hand up? Talked about size of government, how much should it tax families and small businesses? And when we left that lunch, we got in the car and I looked over at Chuck and said, &#39;I&#39;ll be damned. we&#39;re Republicans.&#39;</p><p>Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m not only the engine but the caboose. I have to be in the front car and pull forward, and at the same time run around behind and push everybody along with me.</p><p>That&#39;s what I love. Not being interrupted, sitting in a car by myself and listening to music in the rain. There are so many great songs yet to sing.</p><p>I know I will die in a car crash.</p><p>I married a pretty famous girl, and when we drive through town there&#39;s usually a car following us, when I walk out of my front door in Chelsea there&#39;s six guys waiting for me.</p><p>I&#39;ve tried everything other than jumping out of a plane, but nothing gives you an adrenaline rush like racing a car.</p><p>I take cabs if I need to get somewhere or I take car service. I don&#39;t drive, I wouldn&#39;t mind riding a bike... People think that because you become an entertainer you gotta have this rock star thug image. I&#39;m an artist, man. I&#39;m going to live like an artist.</p><p>The energy of the crowd is insane. Twenty thousand people. It&#39;s the biggest jolt of adrenaline. It&#39;s very hard to explain. You know the old story about the woman lifting the car off her kid? It&#39;s in that realm. You can actually hurt yourself and not know it.</p><p>The first time I rode a bike I was four or five. I crashed into the back of a car.</p><p>If one&#39;s honest about it, spending time in a car with children is pretty ghastly.</p><p>I lived on the top of one hill and the school was at the top of another hill. Nobody ever went to school by car - we didn&#39;t have any cars during the war. So that to and from school was itself a training.</p><p>It&#39;s a tricky place, especially the last sector. I wasn&#39;t happy in practice. I wasn&#39;t happy with the car and I wasn&#39;t happy with myself. But I always thought there was more in the car.</p><p>Qualifying is all about putting everything that you have and that the car has in one lap. It&#39;s like a rush, I really enjoy that.</p><p>All in all it was a smooth race, the car was very well balanced. I&#39;m very proud to be the first winner here in India.</p><p>There is no secret, once we go to qualifying, we all seem to enjoy it. Qualifying is all about putting everything that you have and that the car has in one lap. It&#39;s like a rush, I really enjoy that.</p><p>When you walk the track and you see a corner and realise you were going round it at 160mph, you wonder who could be so stupid to take a corner at that speed. But in the car, you don&#39;t even think about that.</p><p>Simply racing a Formula 1 car is an achievement.</p><p>We always kept believing in ourselves and our team and the car.</p><p>I could never drive in a great big car people like me because I&#39;m a man of the people, a hustler.</p><p>Life&#39;s too short when you find yourself sitting in a car for four hours every day trying to get from East L.A. to West L.A. to Hollywood and then back to East L.A.</p><p>I was an economics major in college, and every summer after school, I would drive my car from California, from Claremont men&#39;s college at the time, to New York. And I worked on Wall Street.</p><p>Divorced men are more likely to meet their car payments than their child support obligations.</p><p>I&#39;m carded for R-rated movies. And I get talked down to a lot. When I try to go rent a car or buy an airplane ticket or other stuff adults do, I get &#39;Okaaaaaay, honey.&#39; I remember when I was 18, getting crayons in a restaurant.</p><p>When I climb into my car, I enter my destination into a GPS device, whose spatial memory supplants my own. I have photographs to store the images I want to remember, books to store knowledge and now, thanks to Google, I rarely have to remember anything more than the right set of search terms to access humankind&#39;s collective memory.</p><p>I own stock, and I also insure my car with Geico.</p><p>My next adventure will be being in a car with Mischa at the wheel.</p><p>A few years ago I was at a party and this guy threw me over his shoulder, ran across the street, put me in his car, and stuck his tongue in my mouth.</p><p>People go to car races to watch the crashes.</p><p>Everybody has a gun in their car in Detroit.</p><p>A woman is gentle, soft, delicate, and a man&#39;s position is to protect her, help her up stairs, make sure she&#39;s in the car safely first. Take good care of your woman, and the sky&#39;s the limit!</p><p>I&#39;m a crazy car guy. I&#39;ve got an airplane hangar full of cars.</p><p>You know, if you&#39;re Guy Kawasaki and you create a car that gets 500 miles a gallon with zero emissions, people on the Internet would say: &#39;I could have done that in half an hour, and it&#39;s been done before. What&#39;s the big deal? I expected something more from him.&#39; Meanwhile, they didn&#39;t do it, right? They&#39;re still living at home with their mothers.</p><p>We should tell our kids to just have fun, participate and not get bent on winning or losing. But every coach, when they say that, they say it tongue in cheek, &#39;Don&#39;t worry about winning&#39;: If you win I&#39;ll get you ice cream, but if you lose I&#39;m going to pout in the car.</p><p>It&#39;s so funny looking back, but my so-called overnight success actually took 15 years. I remember when I didn&#39;t have any money, and my only car was mom&#39;s Hyundai.</p><p>I have mentally overcome situations most of you would be terrified to ever attempt: heights, fire, needles, spiders, snakes, angry monkeys, being shot, being hit by a car, going blind - you name it, I have been in a situation where I have had to mentally overcome my inherent fears to do my job.</p><p>I&#39;m starting to think about things that I want to do, things that are fun. One of them is driving a car like a Porsche. I&#39;ve driven a lot of cars - sedans, trucks and big family vehicles all year long. But there&#39;s nothing like a four-wheel-drive Porsche.</p><p>I drank a lot when I was a teenager and I don&#39;t drink any more, because that&#39;s when I thought, you know, I&#39;m gonna end up a car wreck.</p><p>I&#39;m a big potato chip girl. I don&#39;t like chocolate and cakes and all that, but I have to have my potato chips. I&#39;ve got bags in the back of my car right now! But I never beat myself up about it, because, look: You can&#39;t give up every damn thing. You need something in your life that you like just because you like it!</p><p>I&#39;ve always been an avid reader. If I don&#39;t have a book in the car, I&#39;ll stop and pick one up just to have something to read. I don&#39;t even remember learning to read.</p><p>My work is more about trying to ask good questions and not trying to come up with big shows. Every fashion company is doing that, every car company is doing that.</p><p>Every song has a composer, every book has an author, every car has a maker, every painting has a painter, and every building has a builder. So it isn&#39;t irrational to take this simple logic a little further and say that nature must have had a Maker. It would be irrational to believe that it made itself.</p><p>Here&#39;s the thing that I think about life - if you manage to get into a space where you don&#39;t need that much, where the overhead of your life is not that great and you&#39;re pretty happy and relaxed without that much stuff, you are really liberated because you never have to say yes to something because you want another refrigerator or car!</p><p>The biggest thrill a ballplayer can have is when your son takes after you. That happened when my Bobby was in his championship Little League game. He really showed me something. Struck out three times. Made an error that lost the game. Parents were throwing things at our car and swearing at us as we drove off. Gosh, I was proud.</p><p>I&#39;d like to have the flying car, I think that&#39;d be really cool.</p><p>Anyone can write a story based on the kind of horror where you see a guy in car and then there&#39;s the bad guy in the back seat. It&#39;s infantile to rely on that for telling a story. That&#39;s like going to bed and thinking there&#39;s a monster under your bed. It&#39;s silly.</p><p>I always loved music. You know, my parents said I started singing when I was 4, in the car.</p><p>I think fear is what keeps us from going over the edge. I mean, as a race car driver, I don&#39;t think what makes a good race car driver is a fearless person. I think it&#39;s somebody that is comfortable being behind the wheel of something that&#39;s somewhat out of control.</p><p>I really enjoy not getting in a car and running errands on bikes.</p><p>To say that I am organized is an understatement, but my car tells a different story.</p><p>I lived in small town out in the desert and my friend used to steal his mom&#39;s car in the middle of the night. He&#39;d drive over to my house, I&#39;d sneak out and we&#39;d go out to the desert and just burn things down.</p><p>So, I remember when I was a kid, I was waiting for my mom to come home when she was working late, and, you know, I was like, &#39;Oh my God, what happened to her? Is she OK? Did something happen to her getting in the car?&#39; I was a little kid. But those are actually early onsets of anxiety.</p><p>On my job I end up jumping out of planes. Last week I got in an 18-wheeler and drove down a runway onto a skid track. The week before that they put me in a car and sunk me to the bottom of a lake to see if I could escape without an oxygen tank.</p><p>In L.A., I don&#39;t really want to go out because traffic sucks so bad. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not going to spend five hours a day in my car, so you have to choose where you live very carefully.</p><p>I quit after a bad car accident. The thing about boxing is that you can be a star for five or six years, but when you go back to the old life, it&#39;s tough.</p><p>A lot of the songs start with an image. I was sitting there playing the guitar and I pictured this old, dirty green car, with the window rolled down, in the hot, hot, hot Texas heat, and this beautiful woman I knew when I was a kid sitting behind the wheel, looking out at me.</p><p>I hate modern car radios. In my car, I don&#39;t even have a push-button radio. It&#39;s just got a dial and two knobs. Just AM. One knob makes it louder, and one knob changes the station. When you&#39;re driving, that&#39;s all I want.</p><p>I once went to one of those parties where everyone throws their car keys into the middle of the room. I don&#39;t know who got my moped, but I drove that Peugeot for years.</p><p>Come rain or shine I walk short distances rather than taking my car.</p><p>I think the Smart Car is awesome. The only problem is I&#39;ve been on the freeway and felt like I was going to be blown away like a Tim Hortons coffee cup, so I may have to upgrade to a Mini Cooper - something a little stronger.</p><p>The way you continue to be a successful business is you don&#39;t wait for the car to go off the cliff. You have to manage yourself. And make sure you do it in the right way so you are not making decisions in crisis.</p><p>We each own one car, and we have a reasonable house. It&#39;s a lovely place to be, but it&#39;s not extravagant.</p><p>As soon as I began to earn what might be called fairly large sums, I bought a car and began to explore the country around New York.</p><p>If you saw a dog going to be crushed under a car, wouldn&#39;t you help him?</p><p>One thing that worried me was how writers get categorized and so they end up having to write the same kind of book again and again. That is fine if it is what you want to do, but I would rather be locked in the trunk of my car with a weasel than write the same book every three years until I die.</p><p>I&#39;ve worked as a labourer, driven taxis and school buses, and been a car mechanic - whatever I could do just to get by. But it does mean that I know a little bit about a lot of things.</p><p>What I enjoy doing more than anything is, I have my little antique car collection, and when the weather is pretty I like to get out one of my old cars. I have a little route I run down in the country, down Nachez Trace Parkway. The loop down through there is just really relaxing, not much traffic.</p><p>I am a horrible visual artist. I can&#39;t fix a car, sew, knit, cook, etc. Statistically, there is more I don&#39;t do than do.</p><p>The word &#39;geek&#39; today does not mean what it used to mean. A geek isn&#39;t the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you&#39;re passionate about something.</p><p>A geek isn&#39;t the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you&#39;re passionate about something.</p><p>In the heat of the Russian summer a sleeping car is the most horrible instrument of martyrdom imaginable.</p><p>When I grew up there wasn&#39;t air-conditioning or anything of that nature, and this old car had a wall thickness of about ten inches. So we had a little warmer house in the winter and a little cooler in the summer.</p><p>It sounds like something from a Woody Guthrie song, but it&#39;s true I was raised in a freight car.</p><p>There were times when I thought I would never own a car.</p><p>The image is where you have dinner at night, who you&#39;re seeing. It&#39;s what car you drive and how you dress. People in the industry sell that, and it creates a dream. There&#39;s nothing else.</p><p>I&#39;m the one who gets called up about a problem. I&#39;m the one who gets called up about the street lighting and the abandoned car. I&#39;m the one who gets blamed if the police don&#39;t arrive. I&#39;m the one they blame if a city truck is broken down.</p><p>You know, it&#39;s amazing. I don&#39;t even have a car, would you believe it? I had a motorbike and it got stolen last year. So I&#39;ve got to buy another one of those, I suppose. I can treat myself to that.</p><p>I always keep a ball in the car. You never know.</p><p>I&#39;ve made movies that cost less than one car chase.</p><p>In 1950, when the Giants signed me, they gave me $15,000. I bought a 1950 Mercury. I couldn&#39;t drive, but I had it in the parking lot there, and everybody that could drive would drive the car. So it was like a community thing.</p><p>Some people think my father was a spy, because of working for that government agency in Vietnam, but he can&#39;t find his car keys, much less keep a national secret.</p><p>All I want to know is that I can keep this house for the rest of my days and I want to make good music... and have the odd sports car in the garage, obviously!</p><p>It&#39;s not a case of &#39;look at me in my car&#39; it&#39;s more, &#39;look at the car&#39;. I like the idea of other people enjoying them, because everything has become a bit faceless and nobody likes the motor car any more.</p><p>I didn&#39;t get my first car until I was 22. It was a BMW 1602 and now I&#39;ve got it back I&#39;m waiting to restore it.</p><p>All the times being like, &#39;Who rented this car and why are we going to this place?&#39; You take the easy route and go, &#39;Oh, thanks for the champagne. I&#39;ll have another.&#39;</p><p>The United Nations four or five years ago put out a study that said the meat industry, meat-eating, growing meat for food is the No. 1 killer of our planet - not No. 2 or No. 3: No 1. You know what&#39;s No. 2? Transportation. Everyone thinks that No. 1 is transportation, and goes out and buys a hybrid car. Screw the hybrid cars. Don&#39;t eat hamburgers.</p><p>You cannot expect the guy who drove the car into the ditch to navigate it out of the ditch. You have to put a new driver in the seat. I&#39;m not saying the new driver is going to be any better, but we need a new driver. Kerry is the only choice.</p><p>The idea that maybe you don&#39;t have to own a car if you only need one occasionally may catch on, just like time-sharing caught on in real estate.</p><p>I have always had this mentality because I hated to break anything on the car.</p><p>One of my biggest problems this season was with the clutch at the start of the race. I hate to risk the car.</p><p>I don&#39;t like to go over curbs, because I don&#39;t want to be hard on the car.</p><p>You were not in control You had no visibility: maybe there was a car in front of you, maybe not.</p><p>We have an uncanny ability to make birds do what we want them to do. In Blood Simple there&#39;s a shot from the bumper of a car and it&#39;s going up this road and a huge flock of birds takes off at the perfect moment.</p><p>I took guitar a while back, and my heart wasn&#39;t in it at the time, but I&#39;m ready to try it again. I sing in the car, at home - it&#39;s a huge part of my life, especially since I&#39;m from Tennessee.</p><p>I love Lady Antebellum and Miranda Lambert - they write from the heart. But it&#39;s hard to find a country music lover in L.A. None of my friends really listen to it, and they hate getting in the car with me because I just blast Taylor Swift.</p><p>I definitely love that all these car brands are coming out with hybrid forms of every car that they have. It&#39;s very awesome because I think it does make a difference, and it doesn&#39;t hurt that you save a lot of money on gas.</p><p>I&#39;ve always had an affinity and a passion for cars and that whole car culture.</p><p>Paul is Starsky, and I met him before shooting. He was very kind and encouraged us to go with what we wanted to do. It was very sweet to see them back with the car after 25 years.</p><p>I grew up in Texas and we used to go to Padre Island, eight hours in the car down to the beach.</p><p>My dad used to love Steely Dan, the Stones, Jethro Tull and all that. There was always Steely Dan going in my dad&#39;s car, but I remember The Royal Scam in particular because it has &#39;Kid Charlemagne&#39; on it.</p><p>When I was in New York, I was making a living. We had a summer house and a car that I could put in a garage. That&#39;s something for a stage actor.</p><p>Your car should drive itself. It&#39;s amazing to me that we let humans drive cars... It&#39;s a bug that cars were invented before computers.</p><p>Consider the perverse effect cap and trade has on altruistic actions. Say you decide to buy a small, high-efficiency car. That reduces your emissions, but not your country&#39;s. Instead it allows somebody else to buy a bigger S.U.V. - because the total emissions are set by the cap.</p><p>Every summer my husband and I pack our suitcases, load our kids into the car, and drive from tense, crowded New York City to my family&#39;s cottage in Maine. It&#39;s on an island, with stretches of sea and sandy beaches, rocky coasts, and pine trees. We barbecue, swim, lie around, and try to do nothing.</p><p>It&#39;s like, no matter what I do, I always feel like I&#39;m five years old, and I end up in the back of my father&#39;s car looking out the window, and nothing has changed in 25 years.</p><p>I did a twenty foot print and John Cage is involved in that because he was the only person I knew in New York who had a car and who would be willing to do this.</p><p>I was 16 years old, driving to LA, and sleeping in my car, just trying to make it happen.</p><p>I arrived in California with no job, no car, and no money, but, like millions of other girls, a dream.</p><p>I remember when metal was something you really had to search out, and now I hear it on car commercials.</p><p>You know, sitting in the car when they got back in and - first of all, it was relief. I was not - there were two get away cars or switch cars they were called. And, you know, the group tended to include everyone.</p><p>So much of life is luck. One day you make a right turn and get hit by a car. Turn left and you meet the love of your life. I think I made the correct turn.</p><p>The ought to be a worldwide cultural taskforce that just stops you when you have ideas like combining The Red Desert with an armored car heist movie.</p><p>Well, it is so difficult right now when you look out on the road and how fast people go and the more and more cars you see out there, for teenagers, you&#39;d think a kid that literally, a few years before, was sitting back in a car seat in the back seat is now behind the wheel.</p><p>But I also like to shower my parents with presents. I bought them a beautiful car and a house.</p><p>And we turned off and 30 miles south they&#39;re standing in the middle of our road blocking our way, stopped the car, got out, took us through the path in the woods, where the craft was on the ground.</p><p>So if you&#39;re a robot and you&#39;re living on this planet, you can do things that you can&#39;t do in real life - things that you wished you could do: like fly like have a car that flies like have furniture that is alive.</p><p>Going to car racing school was phenomenal.</p><p>A gun can be dangerous. But a gun can protect you, you can hunt for food with it - you know, the tool itself is a tool. The intention of the party using the tool is a part of the process, right? You know: the knife cuts the steak, stabs the person, saves somebody from danger, cuts somebody out of a car.</p><p>I&#39;ve made club songs, and I&#39;ve made radio songs, and I&#39;ve made the car songs.</p><p>My first car was an &#39;84 Ford Taurus. It caught on fire from me trying to change the fuel pump, so that wasn&#39;t good at all. Dried leaves on the ground while I was trying to change the fuel pump. Don&#39;t do that. Do it on concrete.</p><p>We need a number of solutions - we need more efficiency and conservation. Efficiency is a big one. I think car companies need to do a lot better in producing more efficient cars. They have the technology, we just need to demand them as consumers.</p><p>Twenty years ago, I was living in a lovely cottage on the edge of Dartmoor but I couldn&#39;t afford to run a car.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be in my car all day. I love getting up in the morning in Venice and walking my dogs down to the cafe to get my tea, and then perhaps going to a bookstore and sitting and reading, then walking to the beach.</p><p>The day I won an Emmy was also the day my father passed away. I received a call from my sister on the way to the ceremony and had to turn my car around and catch the first flight back to Karachi.</p><p>Because of that I don&#39;t care when I read in the newspaper that I am colourblind. I went through a red light in my car and I stopped when I before a green light. So I must be really colourblind, eh?</p><p>The courts cannot garnish a father&#39;s salary, nor freeze his account, nor seize his property on behalf of his children, in our society. Apparently this is because a kid is not a car or a couch or a boat.</p><p>Mayors could never get away with the kind of nonsense that goes on in Washington. In our world, you either picked up the trash or you didn&#39;t. You either moved an abandoned car or you didn&#39;t. You either filled a pothole or you didn&#39;t. That&#39;s what we do every day. And we know how to get this stuff done.</p><p>The negative effects of combat were nightmares, and I&#39;d get jumpy around certain noises and stuff, but you&#39;d have that after a car accident or a bad divorce. Life&#39;s filled with trauma. You don&#39;t need to go to war to find it it&#39;s going to find you. We all deal with it, and the effects go away after awhile. At least they did for me.</p><p>In college, my big money memory was saving up to buy a car with my boyfriend, whom I lived with.</p><p>I think I&#39;m pretty smart on what I spend my money on. I still don&#39;t have a new car, I drive my old car that I&#39;ve had forever. But I bought a house in downtown Chicago.</p><p>I&#39;m not a car guy. The subway gets me where I need to go efficiently and cheaply, and I don&#39;t worry about traffic.</p><p>When I&#39;m in town on Sundays, I sometimes go down to the Central Bar in the East Village to watch English football. But my natural inclination now is to get in the car with my wife and kids and get out of town.</p><p>A man from a primitive culture who sees an automobile might guess that it was powered by the wind or by an antelope hidden under the car, but when he opens up the hood and sees the engine he immediately realizes that it was designed.</p><p>Because I&#39;m a young black man driving a really nice, expensive car, I sometimes get harassed when I&#39;m rolling through a ghetto neighbourhood.</p><p>I feel comfortable around every driver out there and each driver is in charge of their own car, but you feel very secure racing the competition out there.</p><p>There are going to be little victories that we claim, even if it&#39;s finishing 15th and putting the car back in hauler without a scratch on it.</p><p>This is like my dad&#39;s race team where we had one Legend car. If we wrecked it, we couldn&#39;t race the next week unless we had enough parts to put it back together again.</p><p>So there is going to be that balance of understanding how to get the best out of the car that day, whether it&#39;s 15th or even if I have a shot at a top 10, protecting that car so we can bring it back when we have to.</p><p>It&#39;s just that fun atmosphere, working on the car, being with the guys. This is exactly what I needed.</p><p>James Finch is exactly what I&#39;m looking for, as far as getting back into the race car to have fun.</p><p>I feel like we&#39;re a very good top-10 car, but we really have to work hard and find a unique way to get these top fives.</p><p>I don&#39;t have an interest in any car that isn&#39;t good for the environment, other than maybe an aesthetic quality in a picture book.</p><p>My dream car would be a Maserati. That would be amazing.</p><p>Parking is a nightmare for me... I still have sensors on my car that help me park.</p><p>People spend so much time in their cars, and it&#39;s a legal way to have fun by speeding a little bit or testing yourself a little bit, and you get to invest in your car. For some people, it becomes their baby.</p><p>In sport there is never any moment that is the same as the other. I have been in Formula One for 12 years, and out of that I had one year with the perfect car.</p><p>I knew that by getting behind the wheel of the car and having had something to drink, the responsibility laid on my shoulders.</p><p>I remember that all of a sudden, the car felt like I couldn&#39;t control it. It was absolutely the most horrifying experience. We rolled over, off the freeway. I think there was something wrong with the car.</p><p>I will never have a drink and get behind the wheel of a car. It&#39;s not illegal to drink and drive, but there becomes a certain point where it does become a crime.</p><p>I never listen to music in the house, I listen to music in the car.</p><p>Investors have few spare tires left. Think of the image of a car on a bumpy road to an uncertain destination that has already used up its spare tire. The cash reserves of people have been eaten up by the recent market volatility.</p><p>Now having said that, I realize that releasing a film in the real world is like trying to get General Motors to release a handmade car.</p><p>On the average, I don&#39;t spend more than 15 minutes in the car - to go to the golf course or the gym. And that&#39;s the only time I listen to the radio.</p><p>Eventually I did that, but it took a lot of twists and turns, and there were a year or two there where I was living with no money at all - no home, no car, no nothing. I was living in somebody&#39;s garage in Los Angeles at that point - for a year.</p><p>I could be on 52nd and Third in Manhattan up and ask a strange for directions and they will help you, that&#39;s a rural heart. Your car breaks down in the middle of Iowa or somewhere, or Tennessee where I&#39;m from, people want to help each other. Given each opportunity, you see how people come together.</p><p>If I test the car for a year I can be quite competitive the next season.</p><p>Have you ever noticed how nice people are at the car wash?! Maybe it&#39;s just me, but it makes me happy. Weird, I know!</p><p>It used to be that you&#39;d have a song recorded by a major country artist and if it was a hit, you could buy a car. Now you can buy a dealership.</p><p>When I finish an album and I find myself listening to it in the car, because it makes me feel a certain way, that&#39;s the time to try to let other people know about it.</p><p>I don&#39;t think radio is selling records like they used to. They&#39;d hawk the song and hawk the artist and you&#39;d get so excited, you&#39;d stop your car and go into the nearest record store.</p><p>I did a lot of gasoline commercials - Hess, Texaco. I was part of the family in the car, the little brat in the back.</p><p>Once when I was 16 I had my car taken away from me for being past curfew. Oh, and I said a bad word once, and I actually did get my mouth washed out with soap.</p><p>I&#39;m addicted to laughing. I go to see a lot of comedy shows. I&#39;m addicted to playing really loud and obnoxious rock music in my car. I&#39;m addicted to beautiful clothes and shoes. I just love gorgeous stuff and work hard to acquire pretty things, shiny things. I&#39;m addicted to shiny things!</p><p>The thing about drugs and sex is that you lose all your inhibitions. I&#39;ve had sex in trains, planes, wine bars... and quite a few car parks!</p><p>From 1997 when we came in, you guys and the public bought seven million more cars. You didn&#39;t get rid of the second car, did you? So what is happening is the growth of cars on the motorway.</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna ride home in the car. I&#39;ll wait for Randy. I think I&#39;ll get home quicker.</p><p>Boys, they can&#39;t take my refrigerator now. They&#39;ll never get my car now. I paid cash for &#39;em and they&#39;re mine, and I&#39;m keepin&#39; &#39;em!</p><p>When the Exxon Valdez spilled in 1989, I was angry. I even wrote on the back of my car, Boycott Exxon!</p><p>The only way people are going to change their car buying habits, and the only way government will get behind alternatively fueled vehicles, is if gasoline prices continue to go up.</p><p>I used to have this Mercedes, a dark blue 450SLC, which was the most beautiful car. I&#39;d like to have another unusual, beautiful car.</p><p>I allow myself one nice car.</p><p>A male gynecologist is like an auto mechanic who has never owned a car.</p><p>They put chains on me they chained my waist, my legs. Put me in the back of a squad car, and I literally blacked out. I didn&#39;t even - there&#39;s whole pieces missing.</p><p>I started out by believing God for a newer car than the one I was driving. I started out believing God for a nicer apartment than I had. Then I moved up.</p><p>Man, coaching is a hard job, and it requires a lot of time... I hear stories from coaches who tell me that players call them in the middle of the night not knowing where they parked their car.</p><p>I was a little different. I still say I&#39;m a little different, because success to me is not having the most money, or having the biggest car or the biggest house.</p><p>I live in a kind of gay bubble. I live in a gay house, I drive a gay car. I eat gay food.</p><p>I think, like everybody else in New Hampshire, when I pull up to fill up my car and I pay $50, I get upset. And I&#39;m wondering if these prices are legitimate.</p><p>I was in prison for a charge in Texas, murder one. Back in the &#39;70s in Texas, I was there. I heard the shot. I was in the car.</p><p>Faith is the substance of hope - of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. So if you can hope for it and imagine it, and keep imagining and hoping and seeing yourself driving a new car, or seeing yourself getting that job, or seeing yourself excel, seeing yourself help that person - that is faith.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna be the best dad that ever lived. I&#39;ll have a ranch with a race car track and a golf course.</p><p>When I was living on the street I would be standing out in front of Grauman&#39;s Chinese Theater, leaning against my car and signing autographs and nobody had any idea that I was living in it.</p><p>I remember my wife and I used to get on plane and see everybody else with their babies. They&#39;d be putting strollers and car seats up above, and we&#39;d think: Oh, please Lord, don&#39;t make us go through that.</p><p>I think there&#39;s a suspicion in the South of people putting on airs. You see it in most successful Southern politicians, but you also see it in someone like Richard Petty, who may be a multimillionaire stock car driver, but he&#39;s also beloved because he has a nice self-deprecatory way about him.</p><p>Is there some risk every day we walk out our front door? Every time we get in our car? Yeah. Are we materially less safe now than we were 10 years ago? Whatever delta there is, it&#39;s very small.</p><p>It bothers me when I hear it in a car commercial or some such. But for the most part, it&#39;s better than seeing sacred music relegated to the scrap heap.</p><p>The will is never free - it is always attached to an object, a purpose. It is simply the engine in the car - it can&#39;t steer.</p><p>I just completed a tour in Europe. I played every night. This requires traveling some days for six hours in a van or a train or a car. After six weeks of that, I checked into the hotel and just fell apart.</p><p>People would say you look weak if you&#39;re not cursing the opposition and driving around in a big black car while always wearing a tie. Above all, to be &#39;strong&#39; you&#39;re always supposed to be giving orders.</p><p>If you or me go to the gas station to fill up our car and it costs us much more than we expected, it will zap our discretionary income. We won&#39;t have the extra money to buy that washing machine or new winter coat-all big ticket items that are important to economic growth.</p><p>I was so wild and crazy and dumb in my car. It didn&#39;t run but 30 miles an hour. You made do.</p><p>When you&#39;re in a race car, you&#39;re going through so many different emotions throughout that race.</p><p>The problem is that the Iraqi people are facing atrocities from both sides - Zarqawi and also the American troops at times. The Zarqawi groups uses car bombs, the Americans use other bombs. You also know what they do in the prisons.</p><p>The driver of a racing car is a component. When I first began, I used to grip the steering wheel firmly, and I changed gear so hard that I damaged my hand.</p><p>Well, you go to Holland and everybody&#39;s on a bike - nobody would think to have a car.</p><p>If I start outsourcing all my navigation to a little talking box in my car, I&#39;m sort of screwed. I&#39;m going to lose my car in the parking lot every single time.</p><p>I think that people don&#39;t know how to do anything anymore. My father was a janitor. He could take a car apart and put it back together. He could build a house in the back yard. Today, if you ask people what they know, they say, &#39;I know how to hire someone.&#39;</p><p>I mean, you have a general tone of it but it&#39;s pretty much you get to come in and you&#39;re going to flip this car and it&#39;s going to blow up and you&#39;re going to come out on fire and you go oh, that&#39;s cool, and then you get paid a lot of money.</p><p>No, in Lethal Weapon I was a taxi cab driver that Mel jumps in front of the taxi and pulls me out of the car and steals the taxi. Then I did some other indie driving for some of the car sequences.</p><p>So then I started doing a lot of episodic TV, just car chases or helicopter chases or whatever.</p><p>They had some really cool rigged cars and things that were different that they would tow behind the camera car that were actually on these trailers that manipulated side to side and stuff like they were getting hit, and actually put the actor right in the middle of the chase.</p><p>I don&#39;t own a car.</p><p>I&#39;m calling from my car, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m like running around like crazy.</p><p>I really like listening to music in my car.</p><p>There are races and then there are races. And without a doubt, the Indy 500 is the race that I&#39;ve always wanted to attend. And now, to be driving the Corvette Pace Car... this is going to be unbelievable.</p><p>It was all that stuff about taking your parents&#39; car when you&#39;re 13, sneaking booze into rock shows and ditching school with your friends. I could relate to that as a former teenager, rather than as a present parent.</p><p>I think the true test of a pop song, for me, and I&#39;ve talked to a lot of other writers about this, is you take your demo, you pop it in your car and you drive down Sunset Blvd. to Santa Monica, and that&#39;s the Hollywood car test.</p><p>I absolutely refuse to reveal my age. What am I - a car?</p><p>I only know it takes weeks to recover, as if one had been in a car accident.</p><p>I would like you all to give me a round of applause as I have not crashed my car in over 15 months.</p><p>Every little kid has always wanted to be a race car driver. This gets some of that out.</p><p>Space isn&#39;t remote at all. It&#39;s only an hour&#39;s drive away if your car could go straight upwards.</p><p>And I think that if I were a for real celebrity that was recognizable everywhere, I&#39;d just crawl under a rock and you know, have someone run over the rock with a car, or something.</p><p>In the United States three new methods of transportation made their appearance at almost the same time - the steamboat, the canal boat, and the rail car.</p><p>Have you heard about the Irishman who reversed into a car boot sale and sold the engine?</p><p>I want do some kind of action movie, car chases and explosions.</p><p>I&#39;m like, &#39;Would you be the person in the room that would boo when Dylan went electric? I know I wouldn&#39;t. Or are you the person that left The Beatles after &#39;She Loves You,&#39; or &#39;Drive My Car?&#39; You weren&#39;t on board for &#39;Revolution 9&#39; or &#39;Day In The Life,&#39; were you?&#39;</p><p>Well, honey, I had the million dollar houses, I had the car, I had the horse, I had the barn I had everything. Was I set free? I didn&#39;t even know what that meant.</p><p>It was in San Diego and I was onstage and couldn&#39;t remember how to play the guitar properly. I was in terrible pain and my nervous system was just going wild, like somebody had just run a car over me.</p><p>The first trip I remember taking was on the train from Virginia up to New York City, watching the summertime countryside rolling past the window. They used white linen tablecloths in the dining car in those days, and real silver. I love trains to this day. Maybe that was the beginning of my fixation with leisurely modes of travel.</p><p>I am very puzzled by the fact that young people are getting infected again. They don&#39;t take precautions despite an enormous amount of information. It&#39;s like riding a race car at 200 kilometers an hour. Some people like the risk.</p><p>I listen to KCRW in the car and Pandora radio, which I stream through the stereo from my iPhone. I&#39;ve been listening to everything from Caribou to Conway Twitty. If I&#39;m going on a longer car ride, I&#39;ll download some podcasts.</p><p>ER was one of my favourites. I played a car accident victim who has leukemia. I got to wear a neck brace and nose tubes for the two days I worked.</p><p>I drive a car that has pleather seats.</p><p>In the history of the world, no one has ever washed a rented car.</p><p>As I was coming out of the closet, our car was hurtling over an embankment.</p><p>Some people say it might be good for your career to die and then come back again. I have died many ways, car crashes, motorcycle crashes, etc. But, I am still alive.</p><p>Dear motorist on the information superhighway. I&#39;m sorry I do not have a car.</p><p>In the end I didn&#39;t get a top car any more. I had no toughness left. That was the reality.</p><p>I was always an observer, even as a child. I could be satisfied to sit in a car for 3 hours and just look at the street go by while my mother went shopping.</p><p>I mostly drive around in a Fiat 500 TwinAir, and that&#39;s a pretty small car!</p><p>Now, personally, I like a car with some sort of character.</p><p>The easiest and simplest thing that any one can do to make their car safer, more gas efficient, whatever - check the tire pressure.</p><p>My first car was a 1976 Toyota Corolla Liftback in red, like the one in &#39;The Blues Brothers.&#39; I painted a Union Jack on the roof. I was absolutely in love with it until I destroyed it, which broke my heart!</p><p>It&#39;s not just the kid who&#39;s spent every penny from his job to upgrade his car to tell the world he cares about sports cars, it&#39;s also the person driving around in a fuel-conscious hybrid electric car, because it&#39;s more a message to the world than an effective means of saving fuel, to be quite honest.</p><p>I&#39;ve been in a car three or four times when it filled with water and it&#39;s not a comfortable feeling.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to worry about whether the car is set up right or not, you know it is, and it&#39;s down to you. Ultimately, that&#39;s what every driver wants.</p><p>I am going to miss that time when you take that corner better than anybody else could have taken it on that lap or you do that great qualifying lap or you make that great pass or you bring a crippled car home.</p><p>Ford used to come to work in a big car with two Admiral&#39;s flags, on each side of the car. His assistant would be there with his accordion, playing, Hail to the Chief.</p><p>Acting advice is a bit like your parents teaching you how to drive a car. You know they&#39;re right, but you still kind of want them to shut up a bit.</p><p>You need someone to tell you how to do things like hitting your marks, or driving a car so it looks right or getting out of a car so it doesn&#39;t take a million years of screen time.</p><p>The thing about New York is you can leave your house without a plan and find the day. You can&#39;t do that in Los Angeles. You need to get in your car, all this, you can&#39;t just drive around like a lunatic. In New York, you can literally walk outside, and wind up anywhere.</p><p>The New Dealers have all left Washington to make way for the car dealers.</p><p>Is it sufficient that you have learned to drive the car, or shall we look and see what is under the hood? Most people go through life without ever knowing.</p><p>I was really into classifieds for awhile. I&#39;m a big negotiator. My father owned a car dealership when I was younger... it&#39;s just in my blood.</p><p>We were racing at circuits where there were no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t a secret that I was gay. I&#39;d come out to my parents during my junior year of high school, on the day that I also wrecked the family car.</p><p>My health is wonderful. I work out. I&#39;m working. Playing music. I have a beautiful wife, a nice home, a nice car, I got money in the bank. I got three beautiful dogs that love me. Like I said, I&#39;m blessed. I survived.</p><p>I&#39;d rather drive the yellow brick road, you wouldn&#39;t happen to know of a rental car place around.</p><p>The red carpet is kind of a surreal experience. There&#39;s nothing normal about it, so for me the most important thing is to maintain some normality right until the point you get out of the car.</p><p>I listened to it last night for the first time since we started this project. I went out to my car and put it in and went to an empty parking lot and just listened and read the little pamphlet that came with it. After two or three songs I burst into tears.</p><p>I&#39;ve been in California for about 15 years now. You&#39;re always in your car and insulated. I miss New York so much.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t going to get such a nice car - I was going to get a cute little hybrid or something, keep the trees happy - but then my grandfather died, and it was all: retail therapy!</p><p>As far as luxury goes, about the only thing I do is... I go first class all the way. I live on the road, so when I&#39;m out there, I&#39;m getting the nice hotel suite, I&#39;m getting the luxury car, I&#39;m eating the good food, and I make sure I take care of myself on the road.</p><p>I have very long legs and I hate driving anything unless it&#39;s a boat or an ATV in the jungle. I like to sit in the back of a car, where I can look out the window, answer my emails on my iPad, or hold hands with a pretty girl.</p><p>If I had done what I was programmed to do, I would now be sitting in a car factory looking at the sizes of wheels, or wondering how to get credit to start a new factory in Russia.</p><p>The senior officer who met with reporters in Baghdad said there had been 21 car bombings in the capital in May, and 126 in the past 80 days. All last year, he said, there were only about 25 car bombings in Baghdad.</p><p>I have a Volvo S60R and it&#39;s a pretty fast car, the R says it all.</p><p>I have a new little stray dog that I&#39;ve had for about a month now. His name is Mikey Mohawk - he&#39;s this little terrier with a natural Mohawk. My friend found him hit by a car on Pico Boulevard.</p><p>When I was little, I used to work with my dad on the engine of his car. Mostly this was a matter of me handing him wrenches.</p><p>When I was 15, my parents left town for a month. They hid the keys to the car, but I found them. That month, I drove my stepdad&#39;s Thunderbird Super Coupe into Manhattan every day, and I would crank Cypress Hill as I flew around the city, racing the taxis.</p><p>The hardest part was when I was in high school not having a job and always being broke. I had to get to auditions without a car. I either took the bus or walked.</p><p>Accidents happen, whether they&#39;re car accidents, friendly fire, drug overdoses. Accidents happen, and they&#39;re tragic. It&#39;s like a bomb that goes off and pieces of shrapnel rip into the flesh of the family. It&#39;s the families that need the compassion, because everywhere they walk, every day, someone reminds them of their loss.</p><p>The fact is that a car used by Gerry Adams and myself during the course of the Mitchell review was bugged by elements within British military intelligence.</p><p>The percentage you&#39;re paying is too high priced While you&#39;re living beyond all your means And the man in the suit has just bought a new car From the profit he&#39;s made on your dreams.</p><p>Like all soul singers, I grew up singing in church but sometimes I would leave early and sit in the car listening to gospel band, The Blind Boys of Alabama. Hearing their lead singer Clarence made me connect the idea of church and show business and see how I could make a career singing music that stirred the soul.</p><p>As you get older, things conk out. It&#39;s a bit like a car. As long as it&#39;s something the mechanics can fix, you can chug on for a few more thousand miles.</p><p>On the dance floor, as much as you say, &#39;Ladies, you are the car. He is the driver. You can only go where he takes you,&#39; they still try to be in control.</p><p>The same things we&#39;ve done the past couple of seasons. We&#39;ve worked on the engine and clutch. We&#39;ll try and pick up the performance and consistency of the car and go back out there.</p><p>We&#39;re going to test with the same car, but we have a new car ready.</p><p>I don&#39;t get rattled about the big things. I get rattled when I have to pick up my laundry, get gas in the car, pick up a script.</p><p>Indy car racing is much more aggressive.</p><p>The racing driver&#39;s mind has to have the ability to have amazing anticipation, coordination, and reflex. Because of the speed the car goes.</p><p>You are going in one second the length of a football field. That means you brain is receiving information from your body what the car is doing physically, bumping, balance, performance.</p><p>You have to visualize a second or two ahead of your car what line you are taking, what you are going to do, before you get there because it comes too fast.</p><p>You always hear the phrase, money doesn&#39;t buy you happiness. But I always in the back of my mind figured a lot of money will buy you a little bit of happiness. But it&#39;s not really true. I got a new car because the old one&#39;s lease expired.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to rap about my car. How generic is that? Be creative.</p><p>Now I&#39;m having to live with sales of around 50,000 per album - but I&#39;m pretty content with my place in the general scheme of things, even if it&#39;s meant I don&#39;t drive a fancy car and can&#39;t afford grand vacations.</p><p>A paparazzo once jumped out of a car and started running backward with me. I slowed down out of courtesy because she started drifting into the street. I reached out my hand and moved her back so she didn&#39;t get hit by a bus.</p><p>I love singin&#39; in the car, it just makes me feel good.</p><p>Yeah, I left Idaho at 17. You know, I graduated high school a year early and just, you know, the typical story, packed up my car and moved out.</p><p>When I&#39;m in the car sometimes it&#39;s like, &#39;Yeah, man, just put on the pop music.&#39; You know what I mean? I don&#39;t want to listen to Tom Waits.</p><p>I&#39;ve already established my (political)machinery. It&#39;s like a car. It&#39;s fixed already. You just have to get in and drive it.</p><p>I remember being at Greenblatt&#39;s on Sunset, and some guy just walked straight up to me, and he had some bling on and whatever, and said something about a party down in Malibu and asked if I would jump in his car and go to the party. All I could think was, &#39;Who are you? I don&#39;t know you, and I don&#39;t care about how good your car is.&#39;</p><p>Should we have background checks, waiting periods? To drive a car you have to pass a test that shows you know how to drive your car safely, you should have to do the same thing with guns.</p><p>Growing up in the Midwest, people don&#39;t drive Porsches and Ferraris. They drive Fords and Chevys. And so even if you have the opportunity to buy a more expensive car, it doesn&#39;t occur to you because it&#39;s not what you relate to.</p><p>I grew up where my parents would literally shove me in the car rather than have to say hello to a neighbor.</p><p>I definitely I prefer to sing in the car. I don&#39;t sing in the shower, maybe its because that&#39;s the one time I don&#39;t need to talk to anyone so I should just shut up, otherwise I&#39;m just, you know, jibber jabber.</p><p>Whenever I drive under a yellow light, I always kiss my finger and tap it on the roof of the car.</p><p>These songs are old friends I have entertained myself with when I&#39;m washing the dishes, driving to the store and walking down the aisles. The ones that you sing when you&#39;re driving in the car and as a singer you always go back to them.</p><p>I have a 6-year-old, and his thing is to turn on Radio Disney in the car, and I get such an allergic reaction to listening to that music and the context into which it falls. I&#39;m really working on him about that.</p><p>In Paris, one is always reminded of being a foreigner. If you park your car wrong, it is not the fact that it&#39;s on the sidewalk that matters, but the fact that you speak with an accent.</p><p>What Paris has done right is to make it awful to get around by car and awfully easy to get around by public transportation or by bike.</p><p>Later, my father died up in Marysville. So, my mother and I got in the car and came down to Hollywood.</p><p>You want to try and bring a character to life in an honest a way as you possibly can. It doesn&#39;t matter whether he&#39;s a doctor, an actor, a car salesman or a captain of a starship. If you can bring truth and honesty to that character, then your audience will believe you.</p><p>That&#39;s when it really came together for me that I was in a Bond film, to have my own spy car!</p><p>At root fame is a sham. I&#39;m not going to live forever and if I am I certainly need don&#39;t you to tell me that so that I will buy a car or a box of dried up crackers.</p><p>When you&#39;re in the car, how well you do is down to you and you alone-no band, no management, no marketing.</p><p>I went to watch my father at Silverstone in the early 1950s, and I&#39;ve still got the car he was in.</p><p>I was brought up in a car family, my dad loved cars and I was taught the art of making an Austin 7 operate.</p><p>The GTO is such an important car because it&#39;s a racing car and a touring car and that&#39;s pretty unusual.</p><p>In real life, one of my friends was killed in a car accident during our sophomore year.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t one to go out and buy a new car and stereo system and expensive clothes. My mom helped keep me grounded.</p><p>What&#39;s monotonous about being an actor and often makes me want to throw in the towel or drive a car off a bridge is the auditioning - the waiting around.</p><p>I&#39;m ashamed to say this, but I watched every episode of &#39;Starsky and Hutch&#39; as a kid. I loved that show, but now I think it&#39;s stupid - they&#39;d have a car chase for no reason, then Paul Michael Glaser would shoot the car and it would blow up.</p><p>Especially in the car ride to and from gym. I find myself spacing out a lot, just visualizing what the Olympics would be like and just having such great role models.</p><p>Most women&#39;s pictures are as boring and as formulaic as men&#39;s pictures. In place of a car chase or a battle scene, what you get is an extreme closeup of a woman breaking down.</p><p>Here is a new car, a new iPhone. We buy. We discard. We buy again. In recent years, we&#39;ve been doing it faster.</p><p>After wrestling with myself for six months, I began medical treatment. During that time I started a band with some friends of mine called Jack&#39;s Car, but that didn&#39;t last.</p><p>Everything officers go through in any chase anywhere in the country, but amped up 100 times! I&#39;m right in the thick of things in a car going like 80 miles an hour, and doing 360s in the middle of the road. It was a wild ride.</p><p>I once bought an old car back after I sold it because I missed it so much and I had forgotten that it never ran. It was a British racing car. You know, because I just wanted it back. I could only remember what was good about it.</p><p>You can&#39;t show me an ad on TV with hard bodies and say I have to buy that car. You have to tell me why that car is better and safer than another car.</p><p>Just because you put higher-octane gasoline in your car doesn&#39;t mean you can break the speed limit. The speed limit&#39;s still 65.</p><p>So for a year I spent all my time hiding from Jack Charlton in the car park practising my skills.</p><p>So I did in fact spend two and a half years in the Middlesbrough car park practising skills. But if you spend four or five or six hours a day practising, you get better.</p><p>My sporting hero was Drazen Petrovic, the NBA basketball player, who was killed in a car accident in 1993. He was a good friend, an unbelievable player, and I dedicated my Wimbledon win to him.</p><p>Driving race cars was an avenue for me to learn how to build my own car, and that was my ambition all along.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been asked, &#39;What is my favorite car?&#39; and I&#39;ve always said &#39;The next one.&#39;</p><p>The best car safety device is a rear-view mirror with a cop in it.</p><p>Every job has its downside. For example, being in a band the travel part of it - getting picked up from your house in a car, going to the airport, getting on a plane, going from the airplane to a van, then going from the van to a hotel.</p><p>Switching over to a hybrid car is one of those right things, but, unfairly or not, it still has a reputation among car enthusiasts as something you have to pedal really fast when you&#39;re on the ramp merging into traffic on the 401.</p><p>Al Gore, the former vice-president of the United States, lives in a mansion that uses more electricity than the average family&#39;s bungalow! David Suzuki rides on a bus that uses more fuel than a Smart car to get across Canada! Oh my God! And this is just the tip of the vanishing iceberg!</p><p>When you buy a gallon of gas, over 60 percent of the energy you pay for goes out the radiator in the form of waste heat? That&#39;s why you have a radiator in your car in the first place.</p><p>I have been in Formula One for 12 years, and out of that I had one year with the perfect car.</p><p>Racing a thoroughbred grand prix car in front of a home crowd will be a surreal and mighty experience.</p><p>The preparation, commitment and desire to win will be no less than the last time I drove a grand prix car in anger.</p><p>It&#39;s sad that women characters have lost so much ground in popular movies. Didn&#39;t &#39;Thelma and Louise&#39; prove that women want to see women doing things on film? Thelma and Louise were in a classic car they were being chased by cops they shot up a truck - and women loved it.</p><p>The very first time I was on a car in Atlanta, I saw the conductor - all conductors are white - ask a Negro woman to get up and take a seat farther back in order to make a place for a white man. I have also seen white men requested to leave the Negro section of the car.</p><p>I&#39;m a car singer, in fact sometimes I pretend to take my dog out for a walk, and I&#39;ll just drive him around and start singin&#39;.</p><p>My car and my adding machine understand nothing: they are not in that line of business.</p><p>I will argue that in the literal sense the programmed computer understands what the car and the adding machine understand, namely, exactly nothing.</p><p>I talk to myself, especially in the car.</p><p>You look at the steamboat, the railroad, the car, the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo-American world, but they were popularized and extended by it. They were made possible by the financial architecture, the capital intensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo-Americans.</p><p>In high school, during marathon phone conversations, cheap pizza dinners and long suburban car rides, I began to fall for boys because of who they actually were, or at least who I thought they might become.</p><p>I hate to play the I-live-in-the-country card, but it really takes all of the &#39;pack the kids into the car and run from here to there&#39; out of the equation.</p><p>Yeah, it&#39;s risky, but no more risky than driving a car.</p><p>A car to pick me up every day, a chair with my name on it, everybody being very polite... what can you do except sit back and watch it all, try to take it all in?</p><p>Yeah, well I think anyone who likes fast cars will love the Tesla. And it has fantastic handling by the way. I mean this car will crush a Porsche on the track, just crush it. So if you like fast cars, you&#39;ll love this car. And then oh, by the way, it happens to be electric and it&#39;s twice the efficiency of a Prius.</p><p>I look at the car park and myself and Dave Watson come in with our old cars, and these young lads come in with their new Porches. I think that society has changed, there seems to be a lack of respect nowadays.</p><p>There are people who own cars and are getting free cell phones. A car helps one find a job, too. Where do you draw the line?</p><p>See, what you&#39;re meant to do when you have a mid-life crisis is buy a fast car, aren&#39;t you? Well, I&#39;ve always had fast cars. It&#39;s not that. It&#39;s the fear that you&#39;re past your best. It&#39;s the fear that the stuff you&#39;ve done in the past is your best work.</p><p>When they searched my car, they said that they found a gasoline canister and I think duct tape. Who wouldn&#39;t have a gasoline canister on them when driving 3,000 miles across country?</p><p>The alarm rings 4:45, again at 5, but I wake up 4:30 naturally. Shower, shave, orange juice, perk my own coffee, hear the news, and the CBS car arrives 5:30.</p><p>Every time I copy something, I can draw it for the rest of my life. But research is so painful - I mean just opening up a magazine looking for a picture of a car or looking out the window looking for a car is just hard!</p><p>I like to sing around the bonfire, in my car and in the shower.</p><p>Can you imagine a guy breaking into your car, and he steals your guitar case &#39;cause he thinks it&#39;s a guitar, and he gets it home and opens it up and there&#39;s a rake inside it, an electric toilet plunger and a dog skull? That actually happened.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot of stress... but once you get in the car, all that goes out the window.</p><p>I hate the outdoors. To me the outdoors is where the car is.</p><p>Men are superior to women, for one thing they can urinate from a speeding car.</p><p>Since September 11, security has been increased everywhere, and we have new IDs to get on to the Fox lot. I drove to the security gate, but realized I&#39;d left my ID in my other car. I just broke into that voice - &#39;Hey, man, I&#39;m Bart Simpson. Who else sounds like this?&#39; The guard waved me through.</p><p>Unfortunately we don&#39;t have all the bits and pieces on the car that we had hoped to have by this stage so we&#39;ve got to make as good a job as we can with what we have and we feel we are doing well with that at the moment.</p><p>But now I feel off the grid. I feel that I am not part of the culture. And because I don&#39;t have a car I don&#39;t really go anywhere to buy things. In fact, I have been in a slow process of selling and giving away everything I own.</p><p>I&#39;ve got a great team of engineers behind this race car. I&#39;ve got a great bunch of mechanics that make it reliable. This car is developed to go out there and be better than the Reynard, and I feel that it is.</p><p>I did 10 years of comedies and 10 years of Westerns. I really like to stay away from car chases. I prefer the more intimate film. You have a much more direct association with the emotions.</p><p>We&#39;re one of the forces that causes actors to fasten seat belts before they take off chasing the bad guy in the car... or removes some of the cigarette smoking on television.</p><p>I promise you a police car on every sidewalk.</p><p>The car is a character in the piece - I&#39;ve never liked the car, I submitted to it&#39;s objectionable popularity.</p><p>I can&#39;t find my car keys in the morning. Trying to get out of my house is a nightmare. &#39;Where&#39;s my wallet? Where are my keys? I have to go find a missing person.&#39;</p><p>I get bored. We seem to have been having a little bit more time off this winter than last winter. I&#39;m always itching to get back in the car. It&#39;s going to get harder, so I&#39;ve got to make sure that I&#39;m doing everything I possibly can do to make sure I can start next season how I ended this season.</p><p>Then as everything, like I say, things started to come together, when things started to go our way, that&#39;s when you results started to come. I was no different driver. I was certainly learning every time I went in the car.</p><p>I don&#39;t drive around London much. Any journey around Islington involves hundreds of speed bumps that seem to tear the bottom of your car off.</p><p>Being an actress is similar to trying to fit in with the popular kids in high school. You&#39;re expected to drive the right car, wear the right clothes and say the right things.</p><p>There&#39;s an unseen force which lets birds know when you&#39;ve just washed your car.</p><p>I think we&#39;ll be in pretty good shape. We&#39;ve got the same car we ran in all the speedway races since 2001, and it&#39;s been a real good car for us. It&#39;s led every race we&#39;ve been in.</p><p>A guy came to the shop every day. A lot of guys put the foam like stuff that forms to you, kinda like the Indy car guys run. He fitted it up and it felt real good, so we&#39;re going to try to run it.</p><p>Luck, like a Russian car, generally only works if you push it.</p><p>When I&#39;m in the car and somebody comes on the radio singing the high notes, I try to sing along.</p><p>Competition among insurers would bring down the cost of health care insurance, just as it brings down the cost of car or homeowners insurance.</p><p>So the first thing that I thought about was, &#39;How is this car going to handle?&#39; But then after I&#39;d been driving with it and practicing with it and I accomplished that, then I just kind of sat back.</p><p>We don&#39;t have any CGI with any of the car stuff. I think it&#39;s a real experience when you see this car going through really fast really wild and you see me driving a lot of the times and also a big chase in downtown Atlanta. It&#39;s just incredible.</p><p>I&#39;ve still got that little freedom part of me that wants to have a car that looks really sexy.</p><p>I haven&#39;t got a car or a house.

Except in my story, the hero doesn&#39;t get off as easily as I did.;Andrew Gross;car 8993;I prefer to sing in the shower vs. the car.
