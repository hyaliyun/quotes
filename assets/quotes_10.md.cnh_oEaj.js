To understand why, we must remind ourselves that capitalism, like science and liberal democracy, was an outgrowth of the Enlightenment. Its principal theorists, even its most prosperous practitioners, believed capitalism to be based on the idea that both buyer and seller are sufficiently mature, well informed and reasonable to engage in transactions of mutual self-interest. If greed was taken to be the fuel of the capitalist engine, the surely rationality was the driver. The theory states, in part, that competition in the marketplace requires that the buyer not only knows what is good for him but also what is good. If the seller produces nothing of value, as determined by a rational marketplace, then he loses out. It is the assumption of rationality among buyers that spurs competitors to become winners, and winners to keep on winning. Where it is assumed that a buyer is unable to make rational decisions, laws are passed to invalidate transactions, as, for example, those which prohibit children from making contracts...Of course, the practice of capitalism has its contradictions...But television commercials make hash of it...By substituting images for claims, the pictorial commercial made emotional appeal, not tests of truth, the basis of consumer decisions. The distance between rationality and advertising is now so wide that it is difficult to remember that there once existed a connection between them. Today, on television commercials, propositions are as scarce as unattractive people. The truth or falsity of an advertiser's claim is simply not an issue. A McDonald's commercial, for example, is not a series of testable, logically ordered assertions. It is a drama--a mythology, if you will--of handsome people selling, buying and eating hamburgers, and being driven to near ecstasy by their good fortune. No claim are made, except those the viewer projects onto or infers from the drama. One can like or dislike a television commercial, of course. But one cannot refute it.","author":"Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business","category":"advertising, commercials, drama, emotional-appeal, falsities, idiocy, logic, mcdonalds, public-discourse, television, television-commercials"},{"quote":"The power of music, narrative and drama is of the greatest practical and theoretical importance. One may see this even in the case of idiots, with IQs below 20 and the extremest motor incompetence and bewilderment. Their uncouth movements may disappear in a moment with music and dancingsuddenly, with music, they know how to move. We see how the retarded, unable to perform fairly simple tasks involving perhaps four or five movements or procedures in sequence, can do these perfectly if they work to musicthe sequence of movements they cannot hold as schemes being perfectly holdable as music, i.e. embedded in music. The same may be seen, very dramatically, in patients with severe frontal lobe damage and apraxiaan inability to do things, to retain the simplest motor sequences and programmes, even to walk, despite perfectly preserved intelligence in all other ways. This procedural defect, or motor idiocy, as one might call it, which completely defeats any ordinary system of rehabilitative instruction, vanishes at once if music is the instructor. All this, no doubt, is the rationale, or one of the rationales, of work songs.","author":"Oliver Sacks, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales","category":"drama, essential, music, narrative, therapy"},{"quote":"Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of DenmarkIs by a forged process of my deathRankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,The serpent that did sting thy father's lifeNow wears his crown.","author":"William Shakespeare, Hamlet","category":"drama, tragedy"},{"quote":"Because you know that's all I needs, all I wants, is for you to try to run, to turn your back on me and run.

He had come to that period of existence, to that narrow strip of tableland, whence the ascent of youth and the descent of age are equally discernible - when, simply because he has lived for so many years, it strikes a man as possible he may have to live for just as many more, with the ability for hard work gone, with the boon companions scattered, with the capacity for enjoying convivial meetings a mere memory, with small means perhaps, with no bright hopes, with the pomp and the circumstance and the fairy carriages, and the glamour which youth flings over earthly objects, faded away like the pageant of yesterday, while the dreary ceremony of living has to be gone through today and tomorrow and the morrow after, as though the gay cavalcade and the martial music, and the glittering helmets and the prancing steeds were still accompanying the wayfarer to his journey's end. Ah! my friends, there comes a moment when we must all leave the coach with its four bright bays, its pleasant outside freight, its cheery company, its guard who blows the horn so merrily through villages and along lonely country roads. Long before we reach that final stage, where the black business claims us for its own speecial property, we have to bid goodbye to all easy, thoughtless journeying and betake ourselves, with what zest we may, to traversing the common of reality. There is no royal road across it that ever I heard of. From the king on his throne to the laborer who vaguely imagines what manner of being a king is, we have all to tramp across that desert at one period of our lives, at all events; and that period is usually when, as I have said, a man starts to find the hopes, and the strength, and the buoyancy of youth left behind, while years and years of life lie stretching out before him. The coach he has travelled by drops him here. There is no appeal, there is no help; therefore, let him take off his hat and wish the new passengers good speed without either envy or repining. Behld, he has had his turn, and let whosoever will, mount on the box-seat of life again, and tip the coachman and handle the ribbons - he shall take that journey no more, no more for ever.

Howard, though a boy, was smaller. Mary took two steps toward him, pushing her face right into his. Listen, you little worm. If I dont take care of those kids, theyll die. Do you understand that? There are babies in there who need to be fed and need to be changed, and I seem to be the only one who realizes it. And there are probably more little kids still in their homes, all alone, not knowing whats happening, not knowing how to feed themselves, scared to death.Howard took a step back, tentatively lifted the bat, then let it fall. What am I supposed to do? he whined.You? Nothing. Wheres Sam?He took off.What do you mean, he took off?I mean him and Quinn and Astrid took off.Mary blinked, feeling stupid and slow. Whos in charge?You think just because Sam likes to play the big hero every couple years that makes him the guy in charge?Mary had been on the bus two years ago when the driver, Mr. Colombo, had had his heart attack. Shed had her head in a book, not paying attention, but she had looked up when she felt the bus swerve. By the time she had focused, Sam was guiding the bus onto the shoulder of the road.In the two years that followed, Sam had been so quiet and so modest and so not involved in the social life of the school that Mary had sort of forgotten that moment of heroism. Most people had.And yet she hadnt even been surprised when it was Sam who had stepped up during the fire. And she had somehow assumed that if anyone was going to be in charge, it would be Sam. She found herself angry with him for not being here now: she needed help.Go get Orc, Mary said.I dont tell Orc what to do, bitch.Excuse me? she snapped. What did you just call me?Howard gulped. Didnt mean nothing, Mary.Where is Orc?I think hes sleeping.Wake him up. I need some help. I cant stay awake any longer. I need at least two kids who have experience babysitting. And then I need diapers and bottles and nipples and Cheerios and lots of milk.Why am I going to do all that?Mary didnt have an answer. I dont know, Howard, she said. Maybe because youre really not a complete jerk? Maybe youre really a decent human being?That earned her a skeptical look and a derisive snort.Look, kids will do what Orc says, Mary said. Theyre scared of him. All Im asking is for Orc to act like Orc.Howard thought this over. Mary could almost see the wheels spinning in his head.Forget it, she said. Ill talk to Sam when he gets back.Yeah, hes the big hero, isnt he? Howard said, dripping sarcasm. But hey, where is he? You see him around? I dont see him around.Are you going to help or not? I have to get back.All right. Ill get your stuff, Mary. But you better remember who helped you. Youre working for Orc and me.Im taking care of little kids, Mary said. If Im working for anyone, its for them.Like I say, you remember who was there when you needed them.

My Life Story.- If I can do it, so can you-I was born and lived in one of the most oldest and most beautiful cities in Albania. for 23 years I lived under the communist regime, where everyone was poor, there was no rich people beside the Elite group who dictate the country. Since I was little girl I dreamed of fairy tale life. But for some reason no one was supportive of my dreams. It looked like they were enjoying watching us living in poverty and keep our heads down, for instance I remember when I was in 5th grade I told my literature teacher \\"When I get older I want to be a beautician.\\" With a smire on her face she said \\"You are going to be just like your mother, keep having kids in a row\\" At that time I did not understood what she meant, but I did not expected that answer from an \\"educated\\" person, especially your teacher. As I got older I started to isolate myself from all the negative people until one day I asked my uncle to help me to get in a beauty college, he knew people in town that's why, I did not wanted to believe he respond. Even today I can hear his words whisper in my ears, telling me \\"Beauty college is not for poor children, education is only for rich kids\\" But that did not stopped me either, I told myself \\"No one can tell me what I can and can't do\\" They just motivated me to prove them wrong. Poor children can go to college. So I decided to make a very big move my that would either end it my life or could change my life for ever. Sep 2, 1990 I had it enough of that hell place, communist regime and all the negative people.I decided to leave everyone behind me and move forward in life, I decided to escape the communist and followed my dreams. I was also escaped from army who was chasing to kill us, but mighty God was with us. We made the local news saying \\"Two young girls were killed today by army forces escaping the borders\\" but I made it alive to Yugoslavia, I spend almost seven months there in concentration camp. There I meet the love of my life also, we dated for five months, until his visa was approved to come in US, two months later I come to state on March of 1991. New place, new chapter in my life, two weeks later got united, neither of us spoke English, it was very hard to find jobs, we manage to get a job in a local restaurant as a dishwasher and me as a bustable, at that time I was very I found a happy, so I did it with smile on my face. We were living at my husband's cousins unfinished basement. Yes we were sharing a single / twin size bed, we had to saved money so we can get our own apartment, we had nothing insite site. I remember when the manager showed us the appartment, it was green shaggy carpet, I told my husband. \\"Honey the carpet is thick enough, we don't need mattress to sleep on it, we can sleep on the carpet\\" later on a co-worker give us some household stuff to start our life with. Later that year our 1st child /daughter was born, two months later we get married in a local Albania church. Life was getting way better than living under the communist regime, later on we have two more children. We decided to bring my parents here so they can help us, I can get back to work or go to school . On April 1, 1998 my father come, we picked him at airport, with tears on his eye he was looking the street lights outside of the car window and said, \\"America is beautiful country, is land of dreams,....when I die please bury me here and not in Albania\\" By that time have I learning enough English to continued my education. I went to beauty school. two years later I graduated and got the state license. Yahhhh my dreams start coming true, remember I told you I always wanted to be a beautician. I found a job in a local salon, couple months later I was promoted to a salon manager.

Novelists do take conscious liberties by depicting not only what people did but trying to explain why they did it.She adds, I depend on the academic research of others when gathering material for my books, but I don't think that my novels should be considered on par with the work of accredited historians. I wouldn't recommend that historians cite historical novels as sources.And they sure don't. They wouldn't risk the scorn of their colleagues by citing novels. But, Lucia adds:I think historical fiction and nonfiction work well together.  I'd bet that historical novels lead more readers to check out nonfiction on the subject rather than the other way around, she says, and then notes:One of the wonderful ironies of writing about history is that making stuff up doesn't mean it's not true.

Yet she was already, innocently, on a divergent path, for as Lord and Lady Thornleigh and their multitude of guests watched the dazzle of fireworks honoring the spring visit of Queen Elizabeth, Justine was hurrying away from the public gaiety. Someone had asked to meet her in private.","author":"Barbara Kyle, Blood Between Queens","category":"historical-fiction, historical-novel"},{"quote":"Please do not mistake me for a twopenny villain.

But I believe I have found proof of it right here in Manhattan.To understand my reasoning, you must recall first that enchanting tale of a mist-enshrouded isle where medieval women--descended from the gods--spawned heroic men. Most notable among these was the young King Arthur. In their most secret confessions, these mystic heroes acknowledged Avalon, and particularly the music of its maidens, as the source of their power.Many a school boy has wept reading of Young King Arthur standing silent on the shore as the magical isle disappears from view, shrouded in mist.The boy longs as Arthur did to leap the bank and pilot his canoe to the distant, singing atoll. To rejoin nymphs who guard in the depths of their water caves the meaning of life. To feel again the power that burns within. But knowledge fades and memory dims, and schoolboys grow up. As the legend goes, the way became unknown to mortal man. Only woman could navigate the treacherous blanket of white that dipped and swirled at the surface of the water.And with its fading went also the music of the fabled isle.Harps and strings that heralded the dawn and incited robed maidens to dance evaporated into the mists of time, and silence ruled.But I tell you, Kind Reader, that the music of Avalon lives. The spirit that enchanted knights in chain mail long eons ago is reborn in our fair city, in our own small band of fair maids who tap that legendary spirit to make music as the Avalon Strings.Theirs is no common gift. Theirs is no ordinary sound. It is driven by a fire from within, borne on fingers bloodied by repetition. Minds tormented by a thirst for perfection.And most startling of all is the voice that rises above, the stunning virtuoso whose example leads her small company to higher planes.Could any other collection of musicians achieve the heights of this illustrious few? I think not.I believe, Friends of the City, that when we witnes their performance, as we may almost nightly at the Warwick Hotel, we witness history's gift to this moment in time. And for a few brief moments in the presence of these maids, we witness the fiery spirit that endured and escaped the obliterating mists of Avalon.","author":"Bailey Bristol, The Devil's Dime","category":"avalon, historical-fiction, music, orchestra"},{"quote":"Amy wondered if Bonaparte could declare war on Miss Gwen alone without breaking his peace with England","author":"Lauren Willig, The Secret History of the Pink Carnation","category":"bonaparte, historical-fiction, lauren-willig, spy"},{"quote":"All that I was and the world that was mine are gone forever.","author":"Jenny Lloyd, Leap the Wild Water","category":"historical-fiction"},{"quote":"It seemed the heavens themselves conspired to cover up our crime.","author":"Jenny Lloyd, Leap the Wild Water","category":"historical-fiction"},{"quote":"Sometimes, the choices we make have devastating consequences","author":"Jeanette Vaughan","category":"baby-boomer, flying-solo, historical-fiction, new-orleans, nora, reader-s-favorite, the-french-quarter"},{"quote":"Megans deception is another hook on which I can hang my conscience.","author":"Jenny Lloyd, Leap the Wild Water","category":"historical-fiction"},{"quote":"They do not call him the terror of husbands and lovers for no reason...","author":"Andrea Zuvich, His Last Mistress","category":"historical-fiction, history"},{"quote":"And I tell her about his description because I want her to know what I now know, which is that the place where the pepper grows is not a place to be afraid ofI tell her: Mama, exile is not always the darkest corner of the earth.

Significantly, the attack on urban underclass black youth culture and its gangster dimensions (glamorization of crime, etc.) is usually presented via a critique of sexism. Since most privileged-class blacks have shown no interest in advancing feminist politics, the only organized effort to end sexism and sexist oppression, this attack on sexism seems merely gratuitous, a smoke screen that deflects away from the fact that what really disturbs bourgeois folks is the support of rebellion, unruly behavior, and disrespect for their class values. In reality, they and their white counterparts fear the power these young folks have to change the minds and life choices of youth from privileged classes. If only underclass black folks were listening to gangsta rap, there would be no public effort to silence and censor this music.

I do not mean to be sentimental about suffering C enough is certainly as good as a feast C but people who cannot suffer can never grow up, can never discover who they are. That man who is forced each day to snatch his manhood, his identity, out of the fire of human cruelty that rages to destroy it knows, if he survives his effort, and even if he does not survive it, something about himself and human life that no school on earth C and indeed, no church C can teach. He achieves his own authority, and that is unshakable. This is because, in order to save his life, he is forced to look beneath appearances, to take nothing for granted, to hear the meaning behind the words. If one is continually surviving the worse that life can bring, one eventually ceases to be controlled by a fear of what life can bring; whatever it brings must be borne. And at this level of experience ones bitterness begins to be palatable, and hatred becomes too heavy a sack to carry.","author":"James     Baldwin","category":"race"},{"quote":"No matter how much respect, no matter how much recognition whites show towards meas long as that same respect and recognition isnt shown towards everyone of our people in this countryCit doesnt exist for me.","author":"Malcolm X","category":"race, social-justice"},{"quote":"If there is such a things as \\"race\\", there is only the Human one.","author":"Tim Heaton","category":"race, southern, southerner"},{"quote":"He didnt see a man with hopes and dreams, with disappointments and accomplishments.

Perhaps. It all depends on how one reads the word \\"progress\\". Most of the Negroes I know do not believe that this immense concession would ever have been made if it had not been for the competition of the Cold War, and the fact that Africa was clearly liberating herself and therefore had, for political reasons, to be wooed by the descendants of her former masters.

As such, we argue that white America's love-hate relationship with black modes of communication can only be interpreted within a framework that considers language a primary site of cultural contestation. It should be clear by now that it's about more than a mothafucka, right? Our analysis of Black Language forms that the dominant culture considers inflammatory, controversial, or stigmatized allows us to make several observations. First, building off what anthropologist and linguist Arthur Spears noted in his discussion of uncensored speech, Black verbal culture, like all cultures is \\"a complex network of predispositions, values, behaviors, expectations and routines.\\" Language practices, in their varying sociocultural contexts, can only be understood if read within the full range of the community's speech activities, and that requires rigorous ethnographic search and analysis.

He knows that he will not be able to repay it, but sees also that nothing will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in definite time. He desires to make this promise, but he has still so much conscience as to ask himself: Is it not unlawful and inconsistent with duty to get out of a difficulty in this way? Suppose, however, that he resolves to do so, then the maxim of his action would be expressed thus: When I think myself in want of money, I will borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know that I never can do so. Now this principle of self-love or of one's own advantage may perhaps be consistent with my whole future welfare; but the question now is, Is it right? I change then the suggestion of self-love into a universal law, and state the question thus: How would it be if my maxim were a universal law? Then I see at once that it could never hold as a universal law of nature, but would necessarily contradict itself. For supposing it to be a universal law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should be able to promise whatever he pleases, with the purpose of not keeping his promise, the promise itself would become impossible, as well as the end that one might have in view in it, since no one would consider that anything was promised to him, but would ridicule all such statements as vain pretenses.","author":"Immanuel Kant, Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals","category":"debt, honor, integrity"},{"quote":"Never offer an oath lightly.

In M?ser's view, a person acquired his identity from his place in the institutional structure of society, a society in which economic, social, and political institutions were not distinguished from one another. His status (as a guildsman, noble landowner, serf, or independent peasant cottager) determined not only how he earned his living, but his sense of who he was, of what his duties and obligations were, of those to whom he ought to defer and those who ought to defer to him. (In the language of modern sociology, M?ser's society was one in which almost all of the individual's roles derived from a single status.) Who one was was largely a continuation of what one's forebears had been. For M?ser the real self was the socially encumbered self, the self based on status, on historical and regional particularity, and on property. It was a self whose prime virtue was honor. Status and the honor that attached to it were inherited, although they could be lost if one failed to live up to the duties of one's rank.","author":"Jerry Z.

It is not that you should leave your wife and run away to the Himalayas. Remain there, where you are, but gradually stop depending on her. There is no need to cause any pain; your wife need not even know it. There is no need to tell her.Seek out the attachments. Try gradually to live without the things that you now think you cannot live without.

In this situation, no useful purpose is served by trying to separate the mother and father and keep the daughter at home. The daughter has already been emotionally expelled from her family; removing her to protective custody is simply the concrete expression of the family reality.These are the cases which many agencies call their tragedies. This report of a child protective worker illustrates a case where removing the child from the home was the only reasonable course of action:Division of Family and Childrens Services received an anonymous telephone call on Sept. 14 from a man who stated that heoverheard Tracy W., age 8, of [address] tell his daughter of a forced oral-genital assault, allegedly perpetrated against this child by her mothers boyfriend, one Raymond S.Two workers visited the W. home on Sept. 17. According to their report, Mrs. W. was heavily under the influence of alcohol at the time of the visit. Mrs. W. stated immediately that she was aware why the two workers wanted to see her, because Mr. S. had hurt her little girl. In the course of the interview, Mrs. W. acknowledged and described how Mr. S. had forced Tracy to have relations with him. Workers then interviewed Tracy and she verified what mother had stated. According to Mrs. W., Mr. S. admitted the sexual assault, claiming that he was drunk and not accountable for his actions. Mother then stated to workers that she banished Mr. S. from her home.I had my first contact with mother and child at their home on Sept. 20 and I subsequently saw this family once a week. Mother was usually intoxicated and drinking beer when I saw her. I met Mr. S. on my second visit. Mr. S. denied having had any sexual relations with Tracy. Mother explained that she had obtained a license and planned to marry Mr. S.On my third visit, Mrs. W. was again intoxicated and drinking despite my previous request that she not drink during my visit. Mother explained that Mr. S. had taken off to another state and she never wanted to see him again. On this visit mother demanded that Tracy tell me the details of her sexual involvement with Mr. S. On my fourth visit, Mr. S. and Mrs. S. were present. Mother explained that they had been married the previous Saturday. On my fifth visit, Mr. S. was not present. During our discussion, mother commented that Bay was not the ?rst one who hadTracy. After exploring this statement with mother and Tracy, it became clear that Tracy had been sexually exploited in the same manner at age six by another of Mrs. S.'s previous boyfriends.On my sixth visit, Mrs. S. stated that she could accept Tracys being placed with another family as long as it did not appear to Tracy that it was her mothers decision to give her up. Mother also commented, I wish the fuck I never had her.It appears that Mrs. S. has had a number of other children all of whom have lived with other relatives or were in foster care for part of their lives.

Can it be said with propriety, that 'the alms depended partly on THE LIBERALITY of the Donor, and partly on THE LIBERTY of the Receiver,' though the latter would not have possessed the alms unless he had received it by stretching out his hand? Can it be correctly said, BECAUSE THE BEGGAR IS ALWAYS PREPARED TO RECEIVE, that 'he can have the alms, or not have it, just as he pleases?'

They are born with a bit of angel-shine about them, and though it wears thin sometimes, there is always enough left to lasso your hearteven when they are sitting in the mud, or crying temperamental tears, or parading up the street in Mothers best clothes.A little girl can be sweeter (and badder) oftener than anyone else in the world. She can jitter around, and stomp, and make funny noises that frazzle your nerves, yet just when you open your mouth, she stands there demure with that special look in her eyes. A girl is Innocence playing in the mud, Beauty standing on its head, and Motherhood dragging a doll by the foot.God borrows from many creatures to make a little girl. He uses the song of a bird, the squeal of a pig, the stubbornness of a mule, the antics of a monkey, the spryness of a grasshopper, the curiosity of a cat, the speed of a gazelle, the slyness of a fox, the softness of a kitten, and to top it all off He adds the mysterious mind of a woman.A little girl likes new shoes, party dresses, small animals, first grade, noisemakers, the girl next door, dolls, make-believe, dancing lessons, ice cream, kitchens, coloring books, make-up, cans of water, going visiting, tea parties, and one boy. She doesnt care so much for visitors, boys in general, large dogs, hand-me-downs, straight chairs, vegetables, snowsuits, or staying in the front yard.She is loudest when you are thinking, the prettiest when she has provoked you, the busiest at bedtime, the quietest when you want to show her off, and the most flirtatious when she absolutely must not get the best of you again. Who else can cause you more grief, joy, irritation, satisfaction, embarrassment, and genuine delight than this combination of Eve, Salome, and Florence Nightingale.She can muss up your home, your hair, and your dignityspend your money, your time, and your patienceand just when your temper is ready to crack, her sunshine peeks through and youve lost again. Yes, she is a nerve-wracking nuisance, just a noisy bundle of mischief. But when your dreams tumble down and the world is a messwhen it seems you are pretty much of a fool after allshe can make you a king when she climbs on your knee and whispers, \\"I love you best of all!","author":"Alan Beck","category":"girls, sweet"},{"quote":"Someday, my young friend, you'll find out that girls are actually people too.

On the other hand, if they were made out of rubber, you could save yourself a lot of time and effort and heartache by just rustling one up out of a car tire. Boys are different from girls. Girls like to be cozy all the time but boys don't. First of all, they like to get all close to you like a coiled-up rubber band, but after a while, they get fed up with being too coiled and need to stretch away to their full stretchiness. Then, after a bit of on-their-own strategy, they ping back to be close to you.

But the opposite may be true. British researchers recently found that girls between the ages of seven and eleven harbor surprisingly strong feelings of dislike for their Barbie dolls, with no other toy or brand name inspiring such a negative response from the children. The dolls \\"provoked rejection, hatred, and violence\\" and many girls preferred Barbie torture -- by cutting, burning, decapitating, or microwaving -- over other ways of playing with the doll. Reasons that the girls hated their Barbies included, somewhat poetically, the fact that they were 'plastic.' The researchers also noted that the girls never spoke of one single, special Barbie, but tended to talk about having a box full of anonymous Barbies. 'On a deeper level Barbie has become inanimate,' one of the researchers remarked. 'She has lost any individual warmth that she might have possessed if she were perceived as a singular person.

However, every girl I spoke with, every single girlregardless of her class, ethnicity, or sexual orientation; regardless of what she wore, regardless of her appearancehad been harassed in middle school, high school, college, or, often, all three. Who, then, is truly at risk of being distracted at school? At best, blaming girls clothing for the thoughts and actions of boys is counterproductive. At worst, its a short step from there to she was asking for it. Yet, I also cant help but feel that girls such as Camila, who favors what she called more so-called provocative clothing, are missing something. Taking up the right to bare arms (and legs and cleavage and midriffs) as a feminist rallying cry strikes me as suspiciously Orwellian. I recall the simple litmus test for sexism proposed by British feminist Caitlin Moran, one that Camila unconsciously referenced: Are the guys doing it, too? If they arent, Moran wrote, chances are youre dealing with what we strident feminists refer to as some total fucking bullshit. So while only girls get catcalled, its also true that only girls fashions urge body consciousness at the very youngest ages. Target offers bikinis for infants. The Gap hawks skinny jeans for toddlers. Preschoolers worship Disney princesses, characters whose eyes are larger than their waists. No one is trying to convince eleven-year-old boys to wear itty-bitty booty shorts or bare their bellies in the middle of winter. As concerned as I am about the policing of girls sexuality through clothing, I also worry about the incessant drumbeat of self-objectification: the pressure on young women to reduce their worth to their bodies and to see those bodies as a collection of parts that exist for others pleasure; to continuously monitor their appearance; to perform rather than to feel sensuality. I recall a conversation I had with Deborah Tolman, a professor at Hunter College and perhaps the foremost expert on teenage girls sexual desire. In her work, she said, girls had begun responding to questions about how their bodies feelquestions about sexuality or arousalby describing how they think they look. I have to remind them that looking good is not a feeling.","author":"Peggy Orenstein","category":"dress-codes, girls, self-objectification"},{"quote":"Did I ever tell you that we used to keep our horses where your house is?Yeah, I mumbled.She continued her story, My brothers used to get up early every morning and go across the street, well, there wasnt a street there yet.

A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before.

Indeed, the brain was the original inspiration and metaphor for the development of the digital computer, and early computers were often described as 'giant brains'.

Then there is an art of self knowledge, which each person has to develop for himself. This art must lead one to be sensitive to how his basically false approach to life is always tending to generate conflict and confusion. The role of art here is therefore not to provide a symbolism, but rather to teach the artistic spirit of sensitive perception of the individual and particular phenomena of one's own psyche. This spirit is needed if one is to understand the relevance of general scientific knowledge to his own special problems, as well as to give effect to the scientific spirit of seeing the fact about one's self as it is, whether on elikes it or not, and thus helping to end conflict.Such an approach is not possible, however, unless one has the spirit that meets life wholly and totally. We still need the religious spirit, but today we no longer need the religious mythology, which is now introducing an irrelevant and confusing element into the whole question.Itwould seem, then, that in some ways the modern person must manage to create a total approach to life which accomplishes what was done in earlier days by science, art and religion, but in a new way that is appropriate to the modern conditions of life.

In a certain sense, the suspicious Tories and militant philistines are right: intellect is dangerous. Left free, there is nothing it will not reconsider, analyze, throw into question. \\"Let us admit the case of the conservative,\\" John Dewey once wrote. \\"If we once start thinking no one can guarantee what will be the outcome, except that many objects, ends and institutions will be surely doomed. Every thinker puts some portion of an apparently stable world in peril, and no one can wholly predict what will emerge in its place.\\" Further, there is no way of guaranteeing that an intellectual class will be discreet and restrained in the use of its influence; the only assurance that can be given to any community is that it will be far worse off if it denies the free uses of the power of intellect than if it permits them. To be sure, intellectuals, contrary to the fantasies of cultural vigilantes, are hardly ever subversive of a society as a whole. But intellect is always on the move against something: some oppression, fraud, illusion, dogma, or interest is constantly falling under the scrutiny of the intellectual class and becoming the object of exposure, indignation, or ridicule.","author":"Richard Hofstadter, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life","category":"anti-intellectualism, criticism, intellectual, intellectualism, intellectuals, radicalism"},{"quote":"Youre too sensitive victims of sexual abuse are told over and over by those whose reality depends on being insensitive.

There would be no secondary, or parasitic, discussion - let alone tertiary: commentary on commentary. We would have, instead, a \\"republic for writers and readers\\" with no cushion of professional opinion-makers to come between creators and audience. While the Sunday papers presently serve as a substitute for the experiencing of the actual exhibition or book, in Steiner's imagined republic the review pages would be turned into listings:catalogues and guides to what is about to open, be published, or be released. What would this republic be like? Would the arts suffer from the obliteration of this ozone of comment? Certainly not, says Steiner, for each performance of a Mahler symphony is also a critique of that symphony. Unlike the reviewer, however, the performer \\"invests his own being in the process of interpretation.\\" Such interpretation is automatically responsible because the performer is answerable to the work in a way that even the most scrupulous reviewer is not. Although, most obviously, it is not only the case for drama and music; all art is also criticism. This is most clearly so when a writer or composer quotes or reworks material from another writer or composer. All literature, music, and art \\"embody an expository reflection which they pertain\\". In other words it is not only in their letters, essays, or conversation that writers like Henry James reveal themselves also to be the best critics; rather, The Portrait of a Lady is itself, among other things, a commentary on and a critique of Middlemarch. \\"The best readings of art are art.\\"No sooner has Steiner summoned this imaginary republic into existence than he sighs, \\"The fantasy I have sketched is only that.\\" Well, it is not.

Oftentimes bitter, sometimes sweet, seldom even wide-awake, architectural criticism of \\"the modern\\" wholly lacks inspiration or any qualification because it lacks the appreciation that is love: the flame essential to profound understanding. Only as criticism is the fruit of such experience will it ever be able truly to appraise anything. Else the spirit of true criteria is lacking. That spirit is love and love alone can understand. So art criticism is usually sour and superficial today because it would seem to know all about everything but understand nothing. Usually the public prints afford no more than a kind of irresponsible journalese wholly dependent upon some form of comparison, commercialization or pseudo-personal opinion made public. Critics may have minds of their own, but what chance have they to use them when experience in creating the art they write about is rarely theirs? So whatever they may happen to learn, and you learn from them, is very likely to put over on both of you as it was put over on them. Truth is seldom in the critic; and either good or bad, what comes from him is seldom his.

You would find it impossible to love deeply an unfamiliar individual portrayed in a photograph, let alone a nation or a race or something as vague as all lost people.Dont wait for a feeling or love in order to share Christ with a stranger. You already love your heavenly Father, and you know that this stranger is created by Him, but separated from Him, so take those first steps in evangelism because you love God. It is not primarily out of compassion for humanity that we share our faith or pray for the lost; it is first of all, love for God.","author":"John Piper","category":"evangelism, mission, piper"},{"quote":"Lack of interest in mission is not fundamentally caused by an absence of compassion or commitment, nor by lack of information or exhortation. And lack of interest in mission is not remedied by more shocking statistics, more gruesome stories or more emotionally manipulative commands to obedience. It is best remedied by intensifying peoples passion for Christ, so that the passions of his heart become the passions that propel our hearts.","author":"Tim A.

In fact, the term \\"missions\\" was first used in its current context by the Jesuits in the sixteenth century. But the International Missionary Council discussions in the 1950s on the missio- Dei convinced most that the mission of the Triune God was prior to any of the number of missions by Christians during the two millennia of church history. Consequently, since there was only one mission, the plural form has dropped out of familir usage and the singular form, \\"mission,\\" has replaced it for the most part. Nevertheless, most churches and lay-persons hang on the plural missions. For that reason, and to make our point clear here, we will refer to it in this work from time to time while alerting believers to the coming change.","author":"Walter C.

A sexy woman knows herself and she likes the way she looks, thinks & feels. She doesn't try to change to match anybody else. She's a good friend herself kind and patient. and she knows how to use her words to tell people she trusts about what's going on inside of her-her fears and anger, love, dreams the mistakes, and needs. When she's angry she expresses her anger in healthy ways. When she's joyful, she does the same thing. She doesn't hide her true self because she is not ashamed. She knows she's just human-exactly how God made her and that's good enough. She's brave enough to be honest and kind enough to except others when they're honest. When two people are sexy enough to be brave and kind with each other, that's love. Sexy is more about how you feel and how you look.

A gorgeous riot of Gerber daisies and lilies in a rainbow of reds, pinks, yellows and oranges. Welcome. Bet Duncan loved sending one of his guys out to pick them up for me. She could hear the smile in his voice, imagined the devilish twinkle in his eyes. Oh, he did. Said its probably the first time in the history of WITSEC that a U.S. Marshal delivered flowers to one of their witnesses. A low chuckle. Well, this was a special circumstance, so they helped me out. I loved the card you sent with them the best though. Proud of you. Give em hell tomorrow. Hed signed it Nathan rather than Nate, which had made her smile. I had no idea you were romantic, she continued. All these interesting things Im learning about you. She hadnt been able to wipe the silly smile off her face after one of the security team members had knocked on her door and handed them to her with a goofy smile and a, special delivery. Baby, you havent seen anything yet. When the trials done youre gonna get all the romance you can handle, and then some. Really? Now that was something for a girl to look forward to, and it sure as hell did the trick in taking her mind off her worries. Well Im all intrigued, because its been forever since I was romanced. What do you have in mind? Candlelit dinners? Going to the movies? Long walks? Lazy afternoon picnics? Not gonna give away my hand this early on, but Ill take those into consideration. And whats the key to your heart, by the way? I mean, other than the thing I did to you this morning. What thing is that? Refresh my memory, he said, a teasing note in his voice. She smiled, enjoying the light banter. It felt good to let her worry about tomorrow go and focus on what she had to look forward to when this was all done. Being with him again, seeing her family, getting back to her life. A life that would hopefully include Nathan in a romantic capacity. Waking you up with my mouth. He gave a low groan. I loved every second of it. But think simpler. Simpler than sex? For a guy like him? Food, then. I bet youre a sucker for a home-cooked meal. Am I right? He chuckled. That works too, but its still not the key. Then what? You. She blinked, her heart squeezing at the conviction behind his answer. Me? Yeah, just you. And maybe bacon, he added, a smile in his voice. He was so freaking adorable. So youre saying if I made and served you a BLT, youd be putty in my hands? Seemed hard to imagine, but okay. A masculine rumble filled her ears. God, yeah. She couldnt help the sappy smile that spread across her face. Wow, you are easy. And I can definitely arrange that. I can hardly wait. Will you serve it to me naked? Or maybe wearing just a frilly little apron and heels? She smothered a laugh, but a clear image of her doing just that popped into her head, serving him the sandwich in that sexy outfit while watching his eyes go all heated. Depends on how good you are. Oh, baby, Ill be so good to you, you have no idea.","author":"Kaylea Cross, Avenged","category":"avenged, humor, kaylea-cross, love, sexy"},{"quote":"Oh my God. It is your nookie box.

Either oblivious of or not wanting to encourage the attraction between them, Wade looked down at his mug as though he wasnt comfortable holding her gaze at such close range, and took a sip. As he swallowed, one side of his mouth curved up and he let out an appreciative groan that seemed to reverberate right through her, heating her blood. Startled, she drank in the almost dreamy expression on his angular face and imagined that same look right after hed enjoyed an intensely satisfying orgasm. Erin couldnt be positive, but if his reaction to a simple cup of coffee made him groan like that, she was pretty sure it had been a while since hed had one of those, too.

Nothing productive could ever be accomplished there, but there would be comfort such as few men have known, there would be torpor. The body swelled with such thoughts, the mind shrank from them, and the longing eyes traveled finally up north, to where those meridians came together at a point above a bland white area vaguely charted, with few landmarks, no doubt sparsely inhabited.

Either I would be surrounded by great, burning masses that were endlessly immolating souls in torment... or else I would find myself trapped within my own mind as a helpless bystander, condemned to watching me live out my life over and over again and powerless to do anything to change any of it. When idle speculation prompted me to dwell on these two options, I would find myself drawn invariably to the former, since the later was just too hideous to contemplate....I was almost afraid to open my eyes, because once I did, I would know one way or the other. Perhaps I could have just lain there forever. Perhaps I was supposed to. Perhaps that was my true condemnation: to simply reside in hell with my eyes closed afraid of opening them lest matters deteriorate even further than they already had.

The spirits of the departed are believed to be possessed of supernatural powers which they did not enjoy in the flesh. They may also be dissatisfied or malignant in consequence of being suddenly deprived of life, and if they are neglected by the living, are apt to be revengeful. Therefore they must be cajoled and propitiated. Fear of beings belonging to a mysterious state or sphere of which he knew nothing continually haunted and terrified primitive man and induced in him what is known as\\" the dread of the sacred.\\" It was every man's personal duty to attend to the demands or requirements of his deceased ancestors. At first he would succour his own immediate forebears with food and gifts; but it must have been borne in upon him that when his parents joined the great majority, the care of the spirits of their parents likewise devolved upon him... and, by degrees, he might even come to regard himself as responsible for the well-being of a line of spirit ancestors of quite formidable genealogy. These, through his neglect, might starve in their tombs; or, alternatively, they might crave his company. Because of vengeance or loneliness they might send disease upon him, for the savage almost invariably believes illness to be brought about by the action of jealous or neglected ancestors. The loneliness of the spirit-world is the dead man's greatest excuse for desiring the company of his descendants.","author":"Lewis Spence, British Fairy Origins","category":"ancestor, ancestors, dead, fairies, fairy"},{"quote":"Yet a mysterious gate lay open within her shadow","author":"and all my flesh was aware of black pathways and hovels and the silence one observes when the dead are near.","category":"Jo?

I'm going to remember what you looked like forever.... And I hope you remember me the same way - clean, ha-ha. I'm glad our last time together was happy.But I'm leaving tonight, leaving the flock, and this time it's for good. I don't know if I'll ever see any of you again. The thing is, Max, that everyone is a little bit right. Added up all together, it makes this one big right.Dylan's a little bit right about how my being here might be putting the rest of you in danger. The threat might have been just about Dr. Hans, but we don't know that for sure. Angel is a little bit right about how splitting up the flock will help all of us survive. And the rest of the flock is a little bit right about how when you and I are together, we're focused on each other - we can't help it.The thing is, Maximum, I love you. I can't help but be focused on you when we're together. If you're in the room, I want to be next to you. If you're gone, I think about you. You're the one who I want to talk to. In a fight, I want you at my back. When we're together, the sun is shining. When we're apart, everything is in shades of gray.I hope you'll forgive me someday for turning our worlds into shades of gray - at least for a while....You're not at your best when you're focused on me. I mean, you're at your best Maxness, but not your best leaderness. I mostly need Maxness. The flock mostly needs leaderness. And Angel, if you're listening to this, it ain't you, sweetie. Not yet....At least for a couple more years, the flock needs a leader to survive, no matter how capable everyone thinks he or she is. The truth is that they do need a leader, and the truth is that you are the best leader. It's one of the things I love about you.But the more I thought about it, the more sure I got that this is the right thing to do. Maybe not for you, or for me, but for all of us together, our flock.Please don't try to find me. This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, besides wearing that suit today, and seeing you again will only make it harder. You'd ask me to come back, and I would, because I can't say no to you. But all the same problems would still be there, and I'd end up leaving again, and then we'd have to go through this all over again.Please make us only go through this once....I love you. I love your smile, your snarl, your grin, your face when you're sleeping. I love your hair streaming out behind you as we fly, with the sunlight making it shine, if it doesn't have too much mud or blood in it. I love seeing your wings spreading out, white and brown and tan and speckled, and the tiny, downy feathers right at the top of your shoulders. I love your eyes, whether they're cold or calculating or suspicious or laughing or warm, like when you look at me....You're the best warrior I know, the best leader. You're the most comforting mom we've ever had. You're the biggest goofball, the worst driver, and a truly lousy cook. You've kept us safe and provided for us, in good times and bad. You're my best friend, my first and only love, and the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, with wings or without....Tell you what, sweetie: If in twenty years we haven't expired yet, and the world is still more or less in one piece, I'll meet you at the top of that cliff where we first met the hawks and learned to fly with them.

God bless the Rixeys ice-cream addiction. There were so many containers, it seemed entirely plausible that theyd robbed an ice-cream delivery truck. He sorted through the tubs until he found a container of chocolate. Bingo. Next, he grabbed the milk from the fridge. And then he opened a bunch of cabinets until he found a blender at the back of one of them. The layer of dust on its surfaces told of how long it had gone unused. He rinsed and wiped it off, then brought the detachable pitcher to the other counter, where the ice cream lay waiting. Shanes expression was two seconds away from amused. Not a word, McCallan. He held up his hands and shook his head, but he couldnt hold back the smile. Fucker. Scoop, scoop, scoop, milk. Lid on, Easy placed the container on the blender and hit mix. Two minutes later, he had something approximating a very thick milk shake. He spooned it into a glass, then gathered the bagel and soup. Next he built his sandwich, sneaking pieces of beef and cheese as he worked. Damn, that looks good, Shane said, pushing off the stool and grabbing a plate for himself. Think Ill make some food for me and Sara, too. Easy suddenly felt less self-conscious with Shane making food for his woman, too. Whoa. He froze with a piece of rye bread in his hand. Jenna was not his woman. But maybe she could be. Slapping the bread on top of the lettuce, Easys thoughts spunhe came up with lots of reasons why it probably wasnt a good idea, but that didnt make him want it any less. Mid-sandwich-making, Shane spoke in low, even tones. We dont have to do that thing where I tell you to handle Jenna with care if youre thinking of starting something with her, do we? For. Fuck. Sake. Not that Easy was particularly surprised by the question. Hadnt he been half expecting it? And, his brain noted with interest, it wasnt a warning off. Nope. I didnt think so, Shane said in that same casual, even tone. I see how protective you are of her, Easy, and Im glad for that. I know youll treat her right, so Im not saying a thing about it, except handle with care. Nodding, Easy concentrated on making the floor stand still under his feet. I like her, Shane, he finally said, echoing the conversation he and Shane had had a few nights ago about Shanes growing feelings for Sara. And, well, hi, how ya doin, Mr. Hypocrite, Easy had told Shane he had to come clean with the team. Despite the fact that Easy hadnt done so himself. Still. Yeah, Shane said, clapping him on the back of the neck and squeezing. I know. Wow.From the thin cabinet next to the oven Easy retrieved a baking sheet to use as a tray. Improvisation he could do. He loaded it down with everything he thought theyd need, lifted it into his arms and then he was all about getting back to Jenna.","author":"Laura Kaye, Hard to Hold on To","category":"sweet"},{"quote":"Because something inside of my heart is ripping apart and it feels like fear, it tastes like panic and anxiety and desperation and I don't know how to understand th image in front of me.

But for many others there was no longer need of conversion. The contours of Christian experience had shifted.

The first stage was brief and obligatory C baptism in the days or months after birth. The second stage would happen later and would take longer C if it took place at all C when confirmation happened and when parents instructed their children and godparents instructed their godchildren in the beliefs and behavior of the Christian church. Indeed, at this time of the rapid spread of Christianity into new territories, it was vitally necessary that the baptizands be taught well. The heroic and valorous values of the folk, the glorious narratives of warriors, the adulation of wealth and strength C all of these were as firmly in place in seventh-century Gaul as the pagan values and narratives had been in third-century Rome.
