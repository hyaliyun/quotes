The highest level of management is to have no management. To achieve this level, managers must learn to inspire those being managed to manage themselves. The premise of self-management is that managers can tap into the strengths of each subordinate and set short-term and long-term goals for them to help them move to a higher level; then, they can formulate countermeasures for each person&#39;s weaknesses so that they can play to their strengths without being constrained by their weaknesses.</p><p>---005---</p><p>Time management? Manage energy, not time! People&#39;s energy and energy are limited. Where do you use your energy? For humans, energy mainly comes from four sources - body, emotion, mind and spirit.</p><p>---006---</p><p>Focus on your strengths and put yourself in places where you can use your strengths. Try to waste as little energy as possible on areas where you are not competent, because it takes much more effort for people to go from incompetence to mediocrity than from first-class to excellence.</p><p>---007---</p><p>In fact, if a decision does not list the action steps one by one and assign the work and responsibilities to someone, it cannot be considered a decision, but at most a wish.</p><p>---008---</p><p>People who have achieved something start with the most important thing, and they only do one thing at a time.</p><p>---009---</p><p>The management principles that enterprises need are: allowing individuals to give full play to their strengths, build a common vision and consistent direction of effort, establish teamwork, and reconcile personal goals and common well-being.</p><p>---010---</p><p>Management is about human beings. Its task is to make people capable of joint performance, to make their strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.</p><p>The object of management is people. The task of management is to enable people to cooperate, to bring out their strengths and to make their weaknesses insignificant.</p><p>---011---</p><p>Do the most important things first. Don&#39;t do the secondary things first. If you don&#39;t make such a choice, you will accomplish nothing.</p><p>---012---</p><p>Today&#39;s society has two needs: for organizations, individuals need to contribute to them; for individuals, they need to use organizations as tools to achieve their life goals. Only effective management can make these two social needs complement each other.</p><p>---013---</p><p>There is another factor of time waste that managers can control and eliminate: managers are wasting other people&#39;s time. Effective managers know how to systematically and sincerely ask their subordinates: &quot;Please think about it, what are the things I often do that waste your time and do not produce results?&quot; Asking such questions, and asking the other party to dare to speak the truth, is the characteristic of an effective manager.</p><p>---014---</p><p>Don&#39;t try to change yourself, because you are unlikely to succeed. However, you should strive to improve the way you work. Also, don&#39;t do work that you can&#39;t do or can&#39;t do well.</p><p>---015---</p><p>Everything a manager says and does must take into account both temporary measures and long-term goals.</p><p>---016---</p><p>Establishing goals is a balance: a balance between business results and following the principles people believe in, a balance between the current needs of the business and the long-term needs, and a balance between desired results and available resources.</p><p>---017---</p><p>The decision-making process often does not start with collecting facts, but rather with one&#39;s own insights.</p><p>---018---</p><p>We must learn to build organizations in a way that allows someone to make full use of his or her expertise in an important area.</p><p>---019---</p><p>Management is about optimizing the benefits of utilizing resources.</p><p>---020---</p><p>Management is a job, so management has its skills, tools, and techniques.</p><p>---021---</p><p>The illiterate people of the future will be those who have no knowledge and cannot update their knowledge. The main reason for adults to be eliminated is the decline in learning ability.</p><p>---022---</p><p>Making use of people&#39;s strengths is a quality that effective managers must possess. It is the key to the effectiveness of an organization&#39;s work and is an indispensable quality for knowledge workers and society.</p><p>---023---</p><p>It is not wealth that determines the economic development. It only determines the headlines of the media, newspapers and television. The ones that actually account for the largest percentage of GDP are still those unknown innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. It is not a few celebrity CEOs who truly drive social progress, but more people who work silently. These people are also unknown and even have low cultural and educational backgrounds. Among these people are managers, entrepreneurs, and start-ups.</p><p>---024---</p><p>The first secret to increasing effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on in order to leverage their strengths, work styles, and values.</p><p>It is the responsibility of those who work with them to observe them (referring to superiors), understand how they work, and make corresponding adjustments to adapt to the most effective working method of the boss.</p><p>---025---</p><p>Innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurs, that is, the means by which they use change as an opportunity to create a new industry or a new service. ... Entrepreneurs need to consciously look for the sources of innovation, for changes in circumstances that indicate opportunities for successful innovation and their signs. They also need to understand the principles of successful innovation and apply them.</p><p>---026---</p><p>Feedback Analysis</p><p>Whenever you make an important decision or take an important action, write down your expectations of the results in advance.</p><p>After 9 to 12 months, compare the actual results with your expectations.</p><p>---027---</p><p>For individual products, the cost of producing a single unit is high, but the factory enjoys greater flexibility. &quot;New&quot; mass production can provide customers with what they want cheaply across a wide range of products. But mass production systems require high capital investment and a high degree of continuity. They also have inventory risks and require an organization that can sell products continuously rather than desperately chasing special individual orders. Process production requires the highest capital investment (in absolute terms) and also requires a continuous and consistent way of working. Because the production process and product are one, changes in the production process can still create new products even if there is no existing market demand for new products, as often happens in the chemical industry. Therefore, the company&#39;s management must develop new markets for new products while maintaining a stable market demand for old products.</p><p>---028---</p><p>In order to control their own performance, managers must not only understand their goals, but also have the ability to measure their performance and results against their goals.</p><p>---029---</p><p>Anyone who is content to rise with the tide will also fall with the tide.</p><p>---030---</p><p>What managers need is a set of criteria that enables them to do what is truly important—things that are productive and meaningful.</p><p>---031---</p><p>There is no management without organization, and there is no organization without management. The management department is a special organ of modern organizations. It is precisely relying on the activities of this organ that functions can be executed and the organization can survive.</p><p>---032---</p><p>Finally, there is the responsibility of the manager to his subordinates. He must first make sure that they understand his requirements, help them set work goals, and achieve them. Therefore, he must be responsible for providing subordinates with the necessary tools, people and information, providing suggestions and advice, and when necessary, teaching them how to perform better.</p><p>---033---</p><p>Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things.</p><p>---034---</p><p>Organizations need effective managers with six characteristics: character, communication, focus, decision-making, goals, and contribution.</p><p>---035---</p><p>A person&#39;s values ​​sometimes conflict with his strengths. What a person does well, even quite well or quite successfully, may not be consistent with his value system. In this case, the work that this person does does not seem to be worth devoting his life to (or even worth devoting too much energy to).</p><p>---036---</p><p>Manage energy, not time. Energy comes from body, mind, spirit and emotions.</p><p>---037---</p><p>Time is the most precious and limited resource. If you can&#39;t manage time, you can&#39;t manage anything.</p><p>---038---</p><p>Hundreds of years from now, when we look back at this era in the context of history, historians may find that the most important thing is not technology, not the Internet, not e-commerce. It is that the human condition has undergone an unprecedented change. This is the first time in history that the number of people with choices has increased dramatically, and our society is not fully prepared to deal with it.</p><p>---039---</p><p>No one can control change, but one can stay ahead of it.</p><p>---040---</p><p>A manager is someone who knows how to use the strengths of others to achieve his or her own goals. As for whether this person is good or bad, and how to educate this person to become a person with ideals, that is God&#39;s business.</p><p>---041---</p><p>Managers must be effective in their work.</p><p>---042---</p><p>What are the demands of the situation? Given my strengths, the way I work, and my values, how can I best contribute to what needs to be accomplished? Finally, what results must be achieved to make a significant impact?</p><p>---043---</p><p>In the &quot;new&quot; system of mass production and process production, it is impossible to control all functions of the enterprise from the center, because all departments must work closely together at every stage of production, so teams composed of representatives from each department must deal with issues related to design, production, marketing and organization at the same time. Team members must understand the work of their own department on the one hand, and understand at any time the impact of their department&#39;s work on the entire enterprise. The enterprise must make decisions that affect the entire enterprise at decentralized levels (sometimes even at levels that are not considered &quot;management&quot; today).</p><p>---044---</p><p>Each system requires different management skills and management organizations. Single-piece production requires people with special skills, while &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; mass production require managers who must be trained in analytical thinking, production scheduling and planning. New mass production, like process production, requires managers who can see the enterprise as a whole when integrating ideas and making decisions.</p><p>---045---</p><p>If a decision is not broken down into step-by-step action steps, it is just a wish.</p><p>---046---</p><p>Effective management comes from respecting individual personality and dignity</p><p>---047---</p><p>Successful organizations must learn to think of themselves as an orchestra, not an army.</p><p>---048---</p><p>Management is an objective function that depends on the task and cultural conditions and is subject to the values ​​and living habits of a certain society.</p><p>---049---</p><p>The biggest difference between effective managers and others is that they cherish time</p><p>---050---</p><p>Management has become the basic organ and function of organizational society</p><p>---051---</p><p>A single-product production system may adopt a centralized management approach, requiring senior management to coordinate different departments.</p><p>---052---</p><p>The key to Ford&#39;s recovery is the organization and construction of management</p><p>---053---</p><p>Strategy is not about studying what we will do in the future, but about studying what we do today to have a future.</p><p>---054---</p><p>Managers should ask themselves honestly: What do I often do that wastes your time and has no effect?</p><p>---055---</p><p>“I’m shocked that you’re teaching MBAs to 23-year-olds. I think it’s basically a waste of time. They don’t have the background. You can teach them skills, like accounting and other things that you can offer, but you can’t teach them to manage.”</p><p>---056---</p><p>The best way to predict the future is to create it.</p><p>---057---</p><p>The competition among enterprises today is not the competition among products, but the competition among business models.</p><p>---058---</p><p>Even the Japanese now have to go beyond the stage of imitating, importing and adopting other people&#39;s technology and learn to carry out real technological innovation by themselves...</p><p>---059---</p><p>...The number of innovations based on clever ideas is so great that even if the percentage of successes is relatively small, it still becomes a considerable source of creating new industries, providing new jobs, and adding new areas of activity to the economy.</p><p>---060---</p><p>&quot;Old-style&quot; mass production can still maintain this management style, but it will encounter considerable difficulties and be inefficient. If the decision-making and integration functions can be decentralized, better performance will be achieved. Because in this production system, close coordination is required between the engineers who design the products, the workers who manufacture the products, and the business personnel who market the products.</p><p>---061---</p><p>You must have enough courage to arrange the order of work according to your own analysis and understanding. Only in this way can managers expect to become the masters of time and tasks, rather than just being their slaves.</p><p>---062---</p><p>Intelligence, imagination and knowledge are all important resources for us. However, resources themselves can only achieve limited results. Only &quot;effectiveness&quot; can transform these resources into results.</p><p>---063---</p><p>Leaders should spend far more time on personnel management and decision-making than on other matters.</p><p>---064---</p><p>“The most inefficient thing in the world is to do something that is not worth doing at all with the highest efficiency.”</p><p>---065---</p><p>The self-development of effective managers is the key to organizational development.</p><p>---066---</p><p>Innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurs, that is, the means by which they use change as an opportunity to create a new industry and a new service. ... Entrepreneurs need to consciously look for the source of innovation, to look for changes in the situation that indicate the existence of opportunities for successful innovation and their signs. They also need to understand the principles of successful innovation and apply them. ────〖Peter Drucker〗 &quot;Innovation and Entrepreneurship&quot;, an American management authority, page 19.</p><p>---067---</p><p>It is the few leaders, not the majority, that determine the structure of a society. The exemplary behavior of a society is the behavior that comes closest to the social ideal, not the behavior of the majority; and by definition, the behavior that comes closest to the social ideal can only be the behavior of a very small minority. In Victorian England, only a small number of people could be called &quot;gentlemen&quot;... The reason why the &quot;gentleman&quot; became the typical representative of Victorian England was because of his widespread acceptance and his practical role in setting the standard for non-gentlemen, not because of his numerical superiority.</p><p>---068---</p><p>Success means you make up your mind and don&#39;t look back.</p><p>---069---</p><p>First things first</p><p>---070---</p><p>Drucker once said, &quot;Nothing is more dangerous than answering the wrong question correctly.&quot;</p><p>---071---</p><p>Tomorrow will always come, and it will always be different from today.

In a learning organization, leaders are designers, servants, and teachers.</p><p>---075---</p><p>Leadership and management are two completely different concepts. The job of a manager is to plan and budget, organize and allocate personnel, control and solve problems. The purpose is to establish order.</p><p>A leader&#39;s job is to set direction, integrate stakeholders, and motivate and inspire employees in order to effect change.</p><p>---076---</p><p>This management philosophy has three main implications for Chinese managers: 1. Breakthrough innovation is the core individual economic driver of macroeconomic growth. 2. Widely accepted good management principles actually vary from time to time. Christensen&#39;s ideas can help managers judge when to follow those widely accepted good management principles and when other principles are more appropriate. 3. Under the guidance of the principle of breakthrough innovation, corporate managers can do two things at the same time: on the one hand, ensure the healthy operation of the company in the short term, and on the other hand, mobilize enough resources to focus on those breakthrough technologies that may eventually lead to the decline of the company.</p><p>---077---</p><p>You get what you invest in.

Most companies pay more attention to it, but they tend to ignore the control of business processes and risks. In risk control, we must especially manage three fatal new risks: Financial risks, such as liquidity, investment, exchange rate, etc.; Legal risks, such as lawsuits for dumping and cooperation; Information risks, such as intellectual property rights and trade secrets, etc.</p><p>---083---</p><p>Figurehead, liaison, leader, listener, communicator, spokesperson, entrepreneur, troubleshooter, resource allocator and negotiator.</p><p>---084---</p><p>The core competitiveness of enterprises increasingly comes from the ability of employees and organizational departments to discover, analyze and solve problems, as well as the means and methods of continuous innovation, improving efficiency and effectiveness, and reducing risks.</p><p>---085---</p><p>Emphasize customer orientation: Consider business objectives and strategic orientation with customers at the center, and consider which business processes should be set up based on customer needs.</p><p>---086---</p><p>We must be good at judgment and differentiation.
