There has seldom been a time in which men were more dissatisfied with life and the more conscious of the need for deliverance, and if they turn away from Christianity it is because they feel that Christianity is a servant of the established order and that it has no real power or will to change the world and to rescue man from his present difficulties.

You may often hear the clich that it is not a religion, but a relationship only - which, I believe, is a bit too vague a statement - 'religion' has long had different meanings and implications depending on who you ask or where you are coming from. Honestly, it is sometimes the case that Christians like to think they are too cool and free and up-close and personal with God to be like other religions. Perhaps that could be argued, that could be the case, as it is written thus: 'You are no longer a slave to sin, but God's child.' So we might very well assert that Christianity is not at all some stale philosophy centered around legalistic guilt and empty rule-keeping, as the modernists so commonly define religion; although by other definitions we might as well be boasting that it is 'The Religion' simply by claiming that it is too real and too special to be deemed 'just another religion'.","author":"Criss Jami","category":"apologetics, christ, christianity, definitions, god, philosophy, relationship, religion, theology"},{"quote":"The Buddha, Christ and Mohammed had to rely on God and karma and human priests for judgement; we dont.

Human beings are its prisoners. The Predator is our lord and master. It has rendered us docile, helpless. If we want to protest, it suppresses our protest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we don't do so... I have been beating around the bush all this time, insinuating to you that something is holding us prisoner. Indeed we are held prisoner! \\"This was an energetic fact for the sorcerers of ancient Mexico ... They took us over because we are food for them, and they squeeze us mercilessly because we are their sustenance. just as we rear chickens in chicken coops, the predators rear us in human coops, humaneros. Therefore, their food is always available to them.\\" \\"No, no, no, no,\\" [Carlos replies] \\"This is absurd don Juan. What you're saying is something monstrous. It simply can't be true, for sorcerers or for average men, or for anyone.\\" \\"Why not?\\" don Juan asked calmly. \\"Why not? Because it infuriates you? ... You haven't heard all the claims yet. I want to appeal to your analytical mind. Think for a moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradictions between the intelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems of beliefs, or the stupidity of his contradictory behaviour. Sorcerers believe that the predators have given us our systems of belief, our ideas of good and evil, our social mores. They are the ones who set up our hopes and expectations and dreams of success or failure. They have given us covetousness, greed, and cowardice. It is the predators who make us complacent, routinary, and egomaniacal.\\" \\"'But how can they do this, don Juan? [Carlos] asked, somehow angered further by what [don Juan] was saying. \\"'Do they whisper all that in our ears while we are asleep?\\" \\"'No, they don't do it that way. That's idiotic!\\" don Juan said, smiling. \\"They are infinitely more efficient and organized than that. In order to keep us obedient and meek and weak, the predators engaged themselves in a stupendous manoeuvre stupendous, of course, from the point of view of a fighting strategist. A horrendous manoeuvre from the point of view of those who suffer it. They gave us their mind! Do you hear me? The predators give us their mind, which becomes our mind. The predators' mind is baroque, contradictory, morose, filled with the fear of being discovered any minute now.\\" \\"I know that even though you have never suffered hunger... you have food anxiety, which is none other than the anxiety of the predator who fears that any moment now its manoeuvre is going to be uncovered and food is going to be denied. Through the mind, which, after all, is their mind, the predators inject into the lives of human beings whatever is convenient for them. And they ensure, in this manner, a degree of security to act as a buffer against their fear.\\" \\"The sorcerers of ancient Mexico were quite ill at ease with the idea of when [the predator] made its appearance on Earth. They reasoned that man must have been a complete being at one point, with stupendous insights, feats of awareness that are mythological legends nowadays. And then, everything seems to disappear, and we have now a sedated man. What I'm saying is that what we have against us is not a simple predator. It is very smart, and organized. It follows a methodical system to render us useless. Man, the magical being that he is destined to be, is no longer magical.

It follows that the one thing we can say about our modern 'knowledge' is that it is wrong...My answer to him was, when people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that 'right' and 'wrong' are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.However, I don't think that's so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so.When my friend the English literature expert tells me that in every century scientists think they have worked out the universe and are always wrong, what I want to know is how wrong are they?

This methodology is characterized, above all else, by the critical spirit: namely, the commitment to the incessant testing of assertions through observations and/or experiments  the more stringent the tests, the better  and to revising or discarding those theories that fail the test. One corollary of the critical spirit is fallibilism: namely, the understanding that all our empirical knowledge is tentative, incomplete and open to revision in the light of new evidence or cogent new arguments (though, of course, the most well-established aspects of scientific knowledge are unlikely to be discarded entirely).. . . I stress that my use of the term 'science' is not limited to the natural sciences, but includes investigations aimed at acquiring accurate knowledge of factual matters relating to any aspect of the world by using rational empirical methods analogous to those employed in the natural sciences.

Like an astronomer alone in his observatory, studying myriads of stars every night through the tiny round lens of the telescope, observing their mysterious courses, their wandering multitude as they are extinguished and then appear again, so Jakob Mendel looked through his glasses out from that rectangular table into the other universe of books, also eternally circling and being reborn in that world above our own.","author":"Stefan Zweig, The Collected Stories of Stefan Zweig","category":"book-lovers, books, collecting-books, knowledge, love, obsession, reading"},{"quote":"When ignorance is passed down for a long time without giving it a second thought, it leads to evil because you are doing it without knowledge.","author":"Nouman Ali Khan","category":"ignorance, knowledge"},{"quote":"Where the senses fail us, reason must step in.","author":"Galileo Galilei","category":"knowledge, reason, science"},{"quote":"There is a huge difference between thinking we know something and actually knowing something.","author":"Eraldo Banovac","category":"difference, difference-quotes, knowing, knowing-quotes, knowledge, knowledge-quotes, life-quotes, motivational-quotes, philosophy, philosophy-quotes, sociology, sociology-quotes"},{"quote":"What is essence of knowledge, if it does not change the way we act?","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"action, behaviour-wisdom, change, education, inspiring-thoughts, knowledge"},{"quote":"I realized that the knowledge I gained over this period in my life was power, and it felt like a waste not to share that wealth with the world, with people who could benefit,","author":"Andrew Kendall, The Dark Dictionary: A Guide to Help Eradicate Your Darkness, Restore Your Light, and Redefine Your Life.","category":"beneficial, knowledge, knowledge-of-self, life, power, realization, share, the-dark-dictionary, waste, wealth"},{"quote":"Whoever holds the keys to house of knowledge, must open the door, for those who search for light of knowledge to enter.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"christian, education, knowledge, learning, life-philosophy, search, seek"},{"quote":"The key to knowledge is the kingdom of God.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"christian, education, kingdom-of-god, knowledge, life-lessons"},{"quote":"If you seek first God's Kingdom, shall find the key to knowledge.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"gods-kingdom, inspirational, knowledge, seek, self-help"},{"quote":"The course of our lives can be altered when we receive the gift of knowledge.","author":"Denis Hachey, Mind to Mind Conversation: Change Your Mind, Change Your Life","category":"change, change-your-life, knowledge"},{"quote":"Perhaps the secret to life is to understand simplistic perfection.

Our external permanency would not be external, in our sense, if it was restricted in its influence to one individual. It must be something which affects, or might affect, every man. And, though these affections are necessarily as various as are individual conditions, yet the method must be such that the ultimate conclusion of every man shall be the same. Such is the method of science. Its fundamental hypothesis, restated in more familiar language, is this: There are Real things, whose characters are entirely independent of our opinions about them; those Reals affect our senses according to regular laws, and, though our sensations are as different as are our relations to the objects, yet, by taking advantage of the laws of perception, we can ascertain by reasoning how things really and truly are; and any man, if he have sufficient experience and he reason enough about it, will be led to the one True conclusion.

Youve been a consultant for a long time, and youve dealt a great deal with top secret information. But youre about to receive a whole slew of special clearances, maybe fifteen or twenty of them, that are higher than top secret.Ive had a number of these myself, and Ive known other people who have just acquired them, and I have a pretty good sense of what the effects of receiving these clearances are on a person who didnt previously know they even existed. And the effects of reading the information that they will make available to you.First, youll be exhilarated by some of this new information, and by having it allso much! incredible!suddenly available to you. But second, almost as fast, you will feel like a fool for having studied, written, talked about these subjects, criticized and analyzed decisions made by presidents for years without having known of the existence of all this information, which presidents and others had and you didnt, and which must have influenced their decisions in ways you couldnt even guess. In particular, youll feel foolish for having literally rubbed shoulders for over a decade with some officials and consultants who did have access to all this information you didnt know about and didnt know they had, and youll be stunned that they kept that secret from you so well.You will feel like a fool, and that will last for about two weeks. Then, after youve started reading all this daily intelligence input and become used to using what amounts to whole libraries of hidden information, which is much more closely held than mere top secret data, you will forget there ever was a time when you didnt have it, and youll be aware only of the fact that you have it now and most others dont  and that all those other people are fools.Over a longer period of timenot too long, but a matter of two or three yearsyoull eventually become aware of the limitations of this information. There is a great deal that it doesnt tell you, its often inaccurate, and it can lead you astray just as much as the New York Times can. But that takes a while to learn.In the meantime it will have become very hard for you to learn from anybody who doesnt have these clearances. Because youll be thinking as you listen to them: What would this man be telling me if he knew what I know? Would he be giving me the same advice, or would it totally change his predictions and recommendations? And that mental exercise is so torturous that after a while you give it up and just stop listening. Ive seen this with my superiors, my colleagues  and with myself.You will deal with a person who doesnt have those clearances only from the point of view of what you want him to believe and what impression you want him to go away with, since youll have to lie carefully to him about what you know. In effect, you will have to manipulate him. Youll give up trying to assess what he has to say. The danger is, youll become something like a moron. Youll become incapable of learning from most people in the world, no matter how much experience they may have in their particular areas that may be much greater than yours.","author":"Greg Grandin, Kissinger's Shadow: The Long Reach of America's Most Controversial Statesman","category":"knowledge, politics, thinking"},{"quote":"You can't reign in obscurity you can't shine in your comfort zone.","author":"Bamigboye Olurotimi","category":"ability, choice, comfort, comfort-zone, decision, determination, idea, knowledge, life, obscurity, performance, progress, reign, reigning, security, shine, success, transformation, vision"},{"quote":"You must know what you need to do every day to carry out your mission","author":"Sunday Adelaja","category":"calling, daily, knowledge, life, mission, need, purpose"},{"quote":"The person who knows his calling will find opportunities everywhere","author":"Sunday Adelaja","category":"calling, find, knowledge, opportunities, people, person, place, places, purpose"},{"quote":"Learning becomes the knowledge builder and we can define learning through the information it absorbs and the capability it builds.","author":"Pearl Zhu, Digital Gaps: Bridging Multiple Gaps to Run Cohesive Digital Business","category":"gap, knowledge, learning"},{"quote":"They had never previously been obliged to engage in such mental effort, and it gave them headaches.

Unfortunately, that kind of education is virtually calculated to bore and alienate gifted minds. But instead of making exceptions where it would do the most good, the educational bureaucracy often prefers not to be bothered.In my case, for example, much of the schooling to which I was subjected was probably worse than nothing. It consisted not of real education, but of repetition and oppressive socialization (entirely superfluous given the dose of oppression I was getting away from school). Had I been left alone, preferably with access to a good library and a minimal amount of high-quality instruction, I would at least have been free to learn without useless distractions and gratuitous indoctrination. But alas, no such luck.Lets try to break the problem down a bit. The education system [] is committed to a warm and fuzzy but scientifically counterfactual form of egalitarianism which attributes all intellectual differences to environmental factors rather than biology, implying that the so-called 'gifted' are just pampered brats who, unless their parents can afford private schooling, should atone for their undeserved good fortune by staying behind and enriching the classroom environments of less privileged students.This approach may appear admirable, but its effects on our educational and intellectual standards, and all that depends on them, have already proven to be overwhelmingly negative. This clearly betrays an ulterior motive, suggesting that it has more to do with social engineering than education. There is an obvious difference between saying that poor students have all of the human dignity and basic rights of better students, and saying that there are no inherent educationally and socially relevant differences among students. The first statement makes sense, while the second does not.The gifted population accounts for a very large part of the worlds intellectual resources. As such, they can obviously be put to better use than smoothing the ruffled feathers of average or below-average students and their parents by decorating classroom environments which prevent the gifted from learning at their natural pace. The higher we go on the scale of intellectual brilliance C and were not necessarily talking just about IQ C the less support is offered by the education system, yet the more likely are conceptual syntheses and grand intellectual achievements of the kind seldom produced by any group of markedly less intelligent people. In some cases, the education system is discouraging or blocking such achievements, and thus cheating humanity of their benefits.","author":"Christopher Langan","category":"autodidacticism, brilliance, brilliant, bureaucracy, children, education-reform, educational-system, genius, gifted, gifted-people, giftedness, good-intentions, indoctrination, intellectual, knowledge, sad-truth, science, self-education, simple-truth, social-justice, socialization, the-road-to-hell, unfairness, youth"},{"quote":"The system that aims at educating our boys and girls in the same manner as in the circus where the trainer teaches the lion to sit on a stool, has not understood the true meaning of education itself.

With respect to time, therefore, no knowledge within us is antecedent to experience, but all knowledge begins with it.But though all our knowledge begins with experience, is does not follow that it all arises from experience. For it is quite possible that even our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we perceive through impressions, and of that which our own faculty of knowledge (incited by sense impressions) supplies from itself, a supplement which we do not distinguish from that raw material until long practice and rendered us capable of separating one from the other.It is therefore a question which deserves at least closer investigation and cannot be disposed of at first sight: Whether there is any knowledge independent of all experience and even of all impressions of the senses?

It depends on the consciousness on the part of the working people in all professions of their responsibility for the social process. This consciousness may be present or it may grow in an organic manner, like a tree or an animal organism. The growth of this consciousness of social responsibility is the most important prerequisite for the prevention of the cancer-like growth of political systems in the social organism. If they are allowed to grow, they will sooner or later bring about social chaos. Furthermore, such consciousness of responsibility alone will, in the course of time, bring the institutions of human society into harmony with the natural functions of work democracy. Political systems come and go without stopping or fundamentally changing the social process. But the pulse of human society would stopand not return should the natural life functions of love, work and knowledge cease for only one day. Natural love, vitally necessary work and scientific search are rational life functions. They can inherently be nothing but rational. Consequently, they are diametrically opposed to any kind of irrationalism. Political irrationalism which infests, deforms and destroys our lives, is  in the strictly psychiatric sensea perversion of social life, caused by the ostracizing of the natural life functions and by their exclusion from the determination of social life.","author":"Wilhelm Reich, The Mass Psychology of Fascism","category":"consciousness, knowledge, love, social-responsibility, work, work-democracy"},{"quote":"People tell me it's a sinTo know and feel too much within","author":"Bob Dylan","category":"feelings, knowledge, sin"},{"quote":"The father of doubts has a son of knowledge.","author":"Sudheer Reddy","category":"deep-thoughts, doubt, knowledge"},{"quote":"Q.

When I was small I never understood why he is so simple actually I disliked it. He use to go to office and return late and have dinner with us. I use to think he never stood for me on anything. But he was the person who uses to take me to the market for Diwali shopping. He uses to give me 20 Rs to eat at school when he had only 30. He tried to fulfill all my wishes in his range. He uses to take me on his bicycle after school tuition and walk while making me sit on bicycle. He uses to scare away lizards for me. He uses to play with me. He was the one who told me to work hard when I failed. He never scolded me for studies but only when I killed an insect intentionally. He was the one who taught me physics and mathematics.Once he found a wounded parrot on the road and he bought him home. He brought medicine for him and applied it on his wounds. Later on a cat took that parrot and he ran after her but the parrot died. He did not had proper food for three four days.He spent each and every penny of his earning for our happiness and never forgot to return any pending amount. He use to talk to us but very less and joke sometimes. His style was very different, we use to tell him to use dye or color on his hairs but he always refused. And when he smiled and laughed he doesnt stop. For every question he had one answer:-TRUST GOD HE WILL DO EVERYTHING,HE IS THE ONE WHO DOES EVERYTHING. He uses to discuss with us lot on Bhagwat Gita. Once he told me:-  Bade prem se milna jag mae sabse aye insaan na jane kis vesh mae tujse mil jayen bhagwaan(meet each person with full love as you never know in which form god will come in front of you).To that I replied:- But according to Bhagwat gita this is kalyug and all will deceive you if you do that. He never drunk alcohol or had non-veg.His habits were like CIf he dont want to do something he will not do it. But later on he started consulting me (A foolish person like me).I use to shout at him each time I was leaving home as he use to put my wallet at some secret safe place. And when he had not kept it even I use to say you must have kept it. He just kept quiet. But later I came to know about the place and it was always the same and I myself realized that why am I shouting at him. Once he said to me  bache apne aap he sekhtae hain(Children learn by themselves). I daily use to woke up walk up to him and say something and then lie down beside him and sleep again. I had lot of fights with him and he was never angry on me. He was just realizing that I am becoming responsible son and we had lot of dreams together and we use to plan a lot.His smile, his eyes, his habits, his innocence, his politeness , his sense of responsibility , his teachings , his knowledge ,his humble nature, his moral values, his love for humans and animals, being non arrogant , no anger, he was never hungry for money , his voice :- hello Sonu beta , theak ho ( My Son C Sonu , are you fine) , his watch, his mobile case, his phone, his shoes, his specs , his laugh, his jokes and all the qualities that were infinite.","author":"Amit Dixit","category":"children, father, fatherhood, god, knowledge, papa, parents, son"},{"quote":"From one thing, know ten thousand things.","author":"Miyamoto Musashi","category":"knowledge, learning"},{"quote":"Dare to research on the originality of any information.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"dare, education, knowledge, lifelong-learner, originality, research, self-education"},{"quote":"Words and numbers are of equal value, for in the cloak of knowledge one is warp and the other woof.","author":"Norton Juster","category":"education, knowledge, learning"},{"quote":"Graduate school introduces student to extensive knowledge search.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"education, graduate-school, knowledge, research, self-motivation, students"},{"quote":"It's worse than treachery.

Indeed, the message is received from the mass media is that knowledge makes love less compelling; that it is ignorance that gives love its erotic and transgressive edge.

Weakness is not a virtue praised by God. How could he desire for you to be weak if he tells us to stand by our conscience? Doing so requires strength. However, there is a difference between arrogance when inflating your ego, and confidence when one truly gets closer to God. One feels large, while the other feels small. Why?

It is not poisonous and was no more common in the 1960s than it had been in previous decades, as Makerere University science professors announced on the radio and stated in print I wrote the question, What is the difference between basimamoto and embalasassa? Anyone who knows anything about the Bantu languagemyself includedwould know the answer was contained in the question: humans and reptiles are different living things and belong to different noun classes A few of my informants corrected my ignorance but many, many more ignored the translation in my question and moved beyond it to address the history of the constructs of firemen and poisonous lizards without the slightest hesitation. They disregarded language to engage in a discussion of events My point is not about the truth of the embalasassa story but rather that the labeling of one thing as true and the other as fictive or metaphoricalall the usual polite academic terms for falsemay eclipse all the intricate ways in which people use social truths to talk about the past. Moreover, chronological contradictions may foreground the fuzziness of certain ideas and policies, and that fuzziness may be more accurate than any exact historical reconstruction Whether the story of the poisionous embalasassa was real was hardly the issue; there was a real, harmless lizard and there was a real time when people in and around Kampala feared the embalasassa. They feared it in part because of beliefs about lizards, but mainly what frightened people was their fear of their government and the lengths to which it would go to harm them. The confusions and the misunderstandings show what is important; knowledge about the actual lizard would not.","author":"Luise White, Speaking with Vampires: Rumor and History in Colonial Africa","category":"basimamoto, beliefs, constructions, constructs, embalasassa, government, government-power, history, interview, interviewing, interviews, knowledge, language, methodology, oral-history, social-truth, social-truths, truth, uganda"},{"quote":"The courage to ask question is a daring act.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita, Think Great: Be Great!","category":"action, ask, choices, courage, daring, daring-life, finding-yourself, inspirational, knowledge, life, life-lessons, question, seek, wisdom-of-lailah-gifty-akita"},{"quote":"What kills leadership growth isn't ignorance, but rather the illusion of knowledge.","author":"Orrin Woodward","category":"ignorance, knowledge, leadership, paraphrasing-daniel-j-boorstin"},{"quote":"Read and search for the answers you seek.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita, Think Great: Be Great!","category":"answers, educational-philosophy, encouragement, find, find-yourself, inner-self, knowledge, life, potential, questions, read, search, seek, seeking-fate, seeking-truth, wisdo"},{"quote":"Our knowledge is limited.

Sure, this turns out to be a subjective analysis, but in the process your own attitudes toward financial risk and reward are revealed.By contrast, personal risk usually defies quantification. It's a matter of values and priorities, an expression of who you are. \\"Playing it safe\\" may simply mean you do not weigh heavily the compromises inherent in the status quo. The financial rewards of the moment may fully compensate you for the loss of time and fulfillment. Or maybe you just don't think about it. On the other hand, if time and satisfaction are precious, truly priceless, you will find the cost of business failure, so long as it does not put in peril the well-being of you or your family, pales in comparison with the personal risks of no trying to live the life you want today.Considering personal risk forces us to define personal success. We may well discover that the business failure we avoid and the business success we strive for do not lead us to personal success at all. Most of us have inherited notions of \\"success\\" from someone else or have arrived at these notions by facing a seemingly endless line of hurdles extending from grade school through college and into our careers. We constantly judge ourselves against criteria that others have set and rank ourselves against others in their game. Personal goals, on the other hand, leave us on our own, without this habit of useless measurement and comparison.Only the Whole Life Plan leads to personal success. It has the greatest chance of providing satisfaction and contentment that one can take to the grave, tomorrow. In the Deferred Life Plan there will always be another prize to covet, another distraction, a new hunger to sate.

But fear of what?Fear of the consequences of following our heart. Fear of bankruptcy, fear of poverty, fear of insolvency. Fear of groveling when we try to make it on our own, and of groveling when we give up and come crawling back to where we started. Fear of being selfish, of being rotten wives or disloyal husbands; fear of failing to support our families, of sacrificing their dreams for ours. Fear of betraying our race, our 'hood, our homies. Fear of failure. Fear of being ridiculous. Fear of throwing away the education, the training, the preparation that those we love have sacrificed so much for, that we ourselves have worked our butts off for. Fear of launching into the void, of hurtling too far out there; fear of passing some point of no return, beyond which we cannot recant, cannot reverse, cannot rescind, but must live with this cocked-up choice for the rest of our lives. Fear of madness. Fear of insanity. Fear of death.These are serious fears. But they're not the real fear.

Its people, scenery, manners, joys, and tragedies should be living tangible interpreters of the real world.

But I soon discovered that college was not quite the romantic lyceum I had imagined.

But in college there is no time to commune with one's thoughts. One goes to college to learn, it seems, not to think. When one enters the portals of learning, one leaves the dearest pleasures C solitude, books and imagination C outside with the whispering pines. I suppose I ought to find some comfort in the thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment, but I am improvident enough to prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a rainy day.","author":"Helen Keller, The Story of My Life: With Her Letters (1887 1901) and a Supplementary Account of Her Education Including Passages from the Reports and Letters of Her Teacher Anne Mansfield Sullivan by John Albert Macy","category":"college, education, learning, stress, thought"},{"quote":"The great aim of education is not knowledge but action.","author":"Herbert Spencer","category":"education"},{"quote":"The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life","author":"Plato","category":"education, future, life, plato"},{"quote":"Teach your scholar to observe the phenomena of nature; you will soon rouse his curiosity, but if you would have it grow, do not be in too great a hurry to satisfy this curiosity.

At the same time he is a prisoner of the assumptions and dogmas of his time, which he does not question, because he has never been told they exist. By the time a young person has reached the age when he has to choose (we still take it for granted that a choice is inevitable) between the arts and the sciences, he often chooses the arts because he feels that here is humanity, freedom, choice. He does not know that he is already moulded by a system: he does not know that the choice itself is the result of a false dichotomy rooted in the heart of our culture. Those who do sense this, and who don't wish to subject themselves to further moulding, tend to leave, in a half-unconscious, instinctive attempt to find work where they won't be divided against themselves. With all our institutions, from the police force to academia, from medicine to politics, we give little attention to the people who leavethat process of elimination that goes on all the time and which excludes, very early, those likely to be original and reforming, leaving those attracted to a thing because that is what they are already like. A young policeman leaves the Force saying he doesn't like what he has to do. A young teacher leaves teaching, here idealism snubbed.

It is indeed bad to eat apples. It is better to make them all into cider. We are much obliged by your kindness in coming so far to tell us those things which you have heard from your mothers. In return, I will tell you some of those we have heard from ours.In the beginning, our fathers had only the flesh of animals to subsist on, and if their hunting was unsuccessful they were starving. Two of our young hunters, having killed a deer, made a fire in the woods to boil some parts of it. When they were about to satisfy their hunger, they beheld a beautiful young woman descend from the clouds and seat herself on that hill which you see yonder among the Blue Mountains.They said to each other, It is a spirit that perhaps has smelt our broiling venison and wishes to eat of it; let us offer some to her. They presented her with the tongue; she was pleased with the taste of it and said: Your kindness shall be rewarded; come to this place after thirteen moons, and you will find something that will be of great benefit in nourishing you and your children to the latest generations. They did so, and to their surprise found plants they had never seen before, but which from that ancient time have been constantly cultivated among us to our great advantage. Where her right hand had touched the ground they found maize; where her left had touched it they found kidney-beans; and where her backside had sat on it they found tobacco.The good missionary, disgusted with this idle tale, said: What I delivered to you were sacred truths; but what you tell me is mere fable, fiction, and falsehood.The Indian, offended, replied: My brother, it seems your friends have not done you justice in your education; they have not well instructed you in the rules of common civility.

A certain streak of genius makes an ominous impression on them, for there exists a deep gulf between genius and the teaching profession. Anyone with a touch of genius seems to his teachers a freak from the very first. As far as teachers are concerned, they define young geniuses as those who are bad, disrespectful, smoke at fourteen, fall in love at fifteen, can be found at sixteen hanging out in bars, read forbidden books, write scandalous essays, occasionally stare down a teacher in class, are marked in the attendance book as rebels, and are budding candidates for room-arrest. A schoolmaster will prefer to have a couple of dumbheads in his class than a single genius, and if you regard it objectively, he is of course right. His task is not to produce extravagant intellects but good Latinists, arithmeticians and sober decent folk. The question of who suffers more acutely at the other's hands - the teacher at the boy's, or vice versa - who is more of a tyrant, more of a tormentor, and who profanes parts of the other's soul, student or teacher, is something you cannot examine without remembering your own youth in anger and shame. yet that s not what concerns us here. We have the consolation that among true geniuses the wounds almost always heal. As their personalities develop, they create their art in spite of school. Once dead, and enveloped by the comfortable nimbus of remoteness, they are paraded by the schoolmasters before other generations of students as showpieces and noble examples. Thus teh struggle between rule and spirit repeats itself year after year from school to school. The authorities go to infinite pains to nip the few profound or more valuable intellects in the bud. And time and again the ones who are detested by their teachers are frequently punished, the runaways and those expelled, are the ones who afterwards add to society's treasure. But some - and who knows how many? - waste away quiet obstinacy and finally go under.","author":"Hermann Hesse, Beneath the Wheel","category":"beneath-the-wheel, education, genius, hermann-hesse, institution, school, students, teachers"},{"quote":"Actually, all education is self-education.

The simple answer is, \\"Because they're scared.\\" I used to suspect that children's defeatism had something to do with their bad work in school, but I thought I could clear it away with hearty cries of \\"Onward! You can do it!\\" What I now see for the first time is the mechanism by which fear destroys intelligence, the way it affects a child's whole way of looking at, thinking about, and dealing with life. So we have two problems, not one: to stop children from being afraid, and then to break them of the bad thinking habits into which their fears have driven them.What is most surprising of all is how much fear there is in school. Why is so little said about it. Perhaps most people do not recognize fear in children when they see it. They can read the grossest signs of fear; they know what the trouble is when a child clings howling to his mother; but the subtler signs of fear escaping them. It is these signs, in children's faces, voices, and gestures, in their movements and ways of working, that tell me plainly that most children in school are scared most of the time, many of them very scared. Like good soldiers, they control their fears, live with them, and adjust themselves to them. But the trouble is, and here is a vital difference between school and war, that the adjustments children make to their fears are almost wholly bad, destructive of their intelligence and capacity. The scared fighter may be the best fighter, but the scared learner is always a poor learner.","author":"John Holt, How Children Fail","category":"children, education, learning, schooling, unschooling"},{"quote":"There is an efficiency inspired by love which goes far beyond and is much greater than the efficiency of ambition; and without love, which brings an integrated understanding of life, efficiency breeds ruthlessness.

Part of what made English a difficult subject for Korean students was the lack of a more active principle in their learning. They were accustomed to receiving, recording, and memorizing. That's the Confucian mode. As a student, you're not supposed to question a teacher; you should avoid asking for explanations because that might reveal a lack of knowledge, which can be seen as an insult to the teacher's efforts. You don't have an open, free exchange with teachers as we often have here in the West. And further, under this design, a student doesn't do much in the way of improvisation or interpretation.This approach might work well for some pursuits, may even be preferred--indeed, I was often amazed by the way Koreans learned crafts and skills, everything from basketball to calligraphy, for example, by methodically studying and reproducing a defined set of steps (a BBC report explained how the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il had his minions rigorously study the pizza-making techniques used by Italian chefs so that he could get a good pie at home, even as thousands of his subjects starved)--but foreign-language learning, the actual speaking component most of all, has to be more spontaneous and less rigid.We all saw this played out before our eyes and quickly discerned the problem.

Learning Greek and Latin used to play the role of character builder, since they were considered to be as exhausting and unrewarding as digging a trench in the morning and filling it up in the afternoon. It was what made a man, or a woman -- or more likely a robot -- of you. Now math serves that purpose in many schools: your task is to try to follow rules that make sense, perhaps, to some higher beings; and in the end to accept your failure with humbled pride. As you limp off with your aching mind and bruised soul, you know that nothing in later life will ever be as difficult.What a perverse fate for one of our kind's greatest triumphs! Think how absurd it would be were music treated this way (for math and music are both excursions into sensuous structure): suffer through playing your scales, and when you're an adult you'll never have to listen to music again. And this is mathematics we're talking about, the language in which, Galileo said, the Book of the World is written. This is mathematics, which reaches down into our deepest intuitions and outward toward the nature of the universe -- mathematics, which explains the atoms as well as the stars in their courses, and lets us see into the ways that rivers and arteries branch. For mathematics itself is the study of connections: how things ideally must and, in fact, do sort together -- beyond, around, and within us. It doesn't just help us to balance our checkbooks; it leads us to see the balances hidden in the tumble of events, and the shapes of those quiet symmetries behind the random clatter of things. At the same time, we come to savor it, like music, wholly for itself. Applied or pure, mathematics gives whoever enjoys it a matchless self-confidence, along with a sense of partaking in truths that follow neither from persuasion nor faith but stand foursquare on their own. This is why it appeals to what we will come back to again and again: our **architectural instinct** -- as deep in us as any of our urges.","author":"Ellen Kaplan, Out of the Labyrinth: Setting Mathematics Free","category":"design, education, inspirational, math, mathematics, science, wonder"},{"quote":"I follow the course marked out by my principles and, what is more, enjoy a deep and noble pleasure in following it.

It may even be salutary to forget. It is only when we forget the early pains and struggles of forming letters that we acquire the capacity for writing. The adult does not remember all the history s/he learned but s/he may hope to have acquired a standard of character and conduct, a sense of affairs and a feeling of change and development in culture. Naturally there is nothing against having a well-stocked mind provided it does not prevent the development of other capacities. But it is still more important to allow knowledge to sink into one in such a way that it becomes fruitful for life; this best done when we feel deeply all we learn. For the life of feeling is less conscious, more dream-like, than intellectual activity and leads to the subconscious life of will where the deep creative capacities of humanity have their being. It is from this sphere that knowledge can emerge again as something deeply significant for life. It is not what we remember exactly, but what we transform which is of real value to our lives. In this transformation the process of forgetting, of allowing subjects to sink into the unconscious before \\"re-membering\\" them is an important element.","author":"Henning Hansmann, Education for Special Needs: Principles and Practice in Camphill Schools","category":"camphill, education, feeling, forgetting, learning, memory, school, waldorf"},{"quote":"When I was twelve I was obsessed.

A liberal education rests on the assumption that nature and human nature do not change very much or very fast and that one therefore needs to understand the past. The practical educators assume that human society itself is the only significant context, that change is therefore fundamental, constant, and necessary, that the future will be wholly unlike the past, that the past is outmoded, irrelevant, and an encumbrance upon the future -- the present being only a time for dividing past from future, for getting ready.But these definitions, based on division and opposition, are too simple. It is easy, accepting the viewpoint of either side, to find fault with the other. But the wrong is on neither side; it is in their division...Without the balance of historic value, practical education gives us that most absurd of standards: \\"relevance,\\" based upon the suppositional needs of a theoretical future.

And -- since I found the armory of logical reasoning more to my liking than the other forms of philosophy, I exchanged all other weapons for these, and to the prizes of victory in war I preferred the battle of minds in disputation.","author":"Pierre Ablard, The Story of My Misfortunes","category":"education"},{"quote":"Trying to get more learning out of the present system is like trying to get the Pony Express to compete with the telegraph by breeding faster ponies.","author":"Edward Fiske","category":"education, homeschool, homeschooling"},{"quote":"...

It needs a return to the conviction that economic growth and the affluence it brings is a means and not an end. The end is what it does to the lives, life-chances and hopes of people. Look at London. Of course it matters to all of us that London's economy flourishes. But the test of the enormous wealth generated in patches of the capital is not that it contributed 20%-30% to Britain's GDP but how it affects the lives of the millions who live and work there. What kind of lives are available to them? Can they afford to live there? If they can't, it is not compensation that London is also a paradise for the ultra-rich. Can they get decently paid jobs or jobs at all? If they can't, don't brag about all those Michelin-starred restaurants and their self-dramatising chefs. Or schooling for children?

Now the lowest level of this structure, which has been least studied and least regarded, was the most important of them all. It is true that it differed considerably in different parts of Europe, but for the religious rather than material reasons. In Protestant Europe it was founded on the Bible and the catechism, whereas in Catholic Europe it was based on the liturgy and on religious art and drama and mime, which made the Church the school of the people. But in either case it provided a system of common beliefs and moral standards, as well as the archetypal patterns of world history and sacred story which formed the background of their spiritual world.","author":"Christopher Henry Dawson, Understanding Europe","category":"education"},{"quote":"The trouble with being educated is that it takes a long time it uses up the better part of your life and when you are finished what you know is that you would have benefited more by going into banking.","author":"Philip K. Dick, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer","category":"education"},{"quote":"The obvious difficulty that has prevented the study of European culture becoming a part of the regular curriculum of studies is its vastness and its complexity. The great advantage of classical education was the fact that it involved the study of only two languages and two literatures and histories. But European culture has produced about twenty vernacular literatures, and its history is spread out among an even larger number of political communities. At first sight it is an unmanageable proposition and we can understand how educationalists have so often come to acquiesce in a cultural nationalism which at least saved them from being overwhelmed by a multiplicity of strange tongues and unknown literatures. But the true method, it seems to me, is rather to find the consitutive factors of the European community and to make them the basis of our study.This means reversing the traditional nationalist approach which concentrated the student's attention on the distinctive characteristics of the national cultures and disregarded or passed lightly over the features that they shared in common. It means also that we should have to devote much more attention to the religious development, since it was in religion that Europe found its original basis of unity.","author":"Christopher Henry Dawson, Understanding Europe","category":"education"},{"quote":"In the West, people learn through the Socratic tradition.
