crossover between freestyle and rap music genres is known in brazil his first lp funk brasil 1989 marks the beginning of the brazilian funk movement initially with versions of rap and freestyle hits from american artists especially the two live crew do wah diddy became mel da mulher feia and one and one became mel dos nmeros sung in portuguesehe got the idea of making portuguese versions of american songs by paying attention to how people at parties that played freestyle music in rio de janeiro known as baile funk would create and sing their own versions of the songs in portuguese as they couldnt understand english and how they would nickname the songs as mel do the song since the original name of the songs in english was too difficult for them to pronounce and memorize the best example is his first song mel da mulher feia song of the ugly woman which was how patrons of the baile funk would call the two live crews version of do wah diddy as they would sing along mulher feia chupa o e d o ugly woman sucks and gives to the two live crews tune he then made a pg version of the song and recorded it and was a smash hit on the radio prompting him to create more songs and record his first album later on marlboro and others started writing their own songs and he released several albumshe used to live in a district of the rio de janeiro city that was very distant nicknamed marlboro country by his peers who started calling him marlboro and the nickname stuckdj marlboro is the host and producer of the radio show big mix in rio dj marlboro was introduced to a worldwide audience in 2004 when german journalist record label owner and fellow dj daniel haaksman formed man recordings and recruited both dj marlboro and eduk and dj marlboro creating a link between south american and european artistsdj marlboro credits the resurgence of funk fever in brazil to the cyclical nature of musical fads saying in his 23 years as a dj hes witnessed the funk explosion several times brazilian bailes well attended dance parties that played american soul disco and funk music featured heavy bass sounds and light systems dj marlboros portuguese rapping in his 1989 lp funk brazil helped introduce portuguese music into these bailes where the heavy bass sounds became a platform for this new sound as a result by the mid1990s most of the music played by funk djs was produced in brazil currently dj marlboro is the resident dj at so paulos love clubdj marlboro maintains that funk is a way of expression that was born from the common people to him funk is at its best when most people are unaware of it preventing the exploitation of artists dj marlboro expresses the importance of its underlying culture by asserting that the movement need not be glorified or globally successful he insists that funk will always continue to be played whether the world can hear it or not 5 he urges listeners to understand that it is a musical movement that has sprung from culture and a passion to tell the truth not from the need to accept and nationalize music from other parts of the world particularly the united states he acknowledges that recordings are not a priority for funk artists because the point is to go the bailes and dancedj marlboro embraces and supports the undergroundness of the baile funk scene particularly the music played at the bailes in brazil in an interview dj marlboro says the bailes in rio have survived such a long time because we do the bailes to please the public we work with music that doesnt need to recognised or be successful in the rest of the world we play tracks that are popular in the bailes full stop we dont need media and marketing he embraces the aspect of funk and certain artists being unknown because that keeps this genre alive in the streets despite the resistance from the media and upperclass culture the resistance from the upperclass and police stems from the upper class considering this music to be strictly pornographic offensive and sexually explicit dj marlboro is a main public face trying to reverse that opinion and have the people look deeper into the true origins and messages of the music as stated in an interview with dj marlboro in 2003 chuck d refers to rap as the black cnn in many respects rio or baile funk could be referred to as favela cnn that is its used as a medium to convey how the people who live in the brazilian favelas really feel using their own language idioms and slang this helps empower these artists and while they may not gain national acclaim they get the respect of their fans for delivering both a real sound and message this is also seen through the lack of major record deals in the world of funk musiche knows first hand the hardships of being a funk artist in a separate interview he says we suffer a lot of persecution at one recent baile the police came in and shut it down my sound systems have bullet holes in them from police attacks dj marlboro has transcended this situation however as he has now become international and has teamed up with recognized artists such as mia through these various collaborations dj marlboro has played a significant role in increasing the popularity of funk carioca not only within brazil but at the global level as well in fact he has been one of the main players in taking funk abroad playing shows throughout europe britain germany france the united states and even chinamarlboros sets have been in demand in some of the major electronic festivals in the world festivals such as sonar in spain brasil 40 degrees in london summer stage central park in new york tim festival in rio sonarsound in so paulo and elektronika in belo horizonteaccording to an interview with dj marlboro in 2003 dj marlboro believes in which keeping funk discreet to the public may reduce the amount of exploitation within the genre the best time for funk is when people dont know about it for those of us who are funkateers that is in relation to the exploitation of funk he mentioned that people view funk as an image of women with big butts you never see the many sides to funk so people look and they think that funk is pornographic funk is violent but funk is all of this its violent romantic and playful he embraces the baile funk scene in rio because he enjoys pleasing the public it is assumed that individuals that are new to funk genre just assume that baile funk is just associated with pornographic notions according to an article on rio baile funk favela booty beats baile funk is nothing like

the hypothesis concerns what aspects of a language learners first language l1 is carried over into the grammar of their second language l2 in addition to mechanisms of universal grammar that allow new acquisition to take placewhereas many researchers lean towards a full transfer view in which all the l1 grammar transfers ie the initial state of the l2 is the final state of the first youngscholten and vainikka have argued that only lexical categories eg the noun phrase are drawn from the l1 and that functional categories eg the inflectional phrase that represents tense do not rather the learner

hypothesis remains particularly controversial and has been strongly critiqued in syntactic research on both empirical and conceptual grounds some researchers argue that linguistic behaviour does not follow the model and others claim that it is theoretically misconceived for example the idea that a component of language could be absent from the initial stage so that the system selectively extracts

viktor reneysky was looking for fresh talent for his k4 boat which had failed to maintain the progress of previous years turchyn was surprisingly chosen ahead of stanislau strelchanka to replace aliaksei skurkouski in the senior k4 500 m crew turchyn had been selected not just for his athletic ability but also for his phlegmatic temperament indeed some observers worried that he would not wake up for big races his new teammates however laughed off such fears and at turchyns first major championship he justified their faith as the belarusian four took the 2004 european k4 500 m silver medal in pozna polandat the olympics the only k4 race is over 1000 m and reneysky dropped skurkouski from the 1000 m lineup as well in favour of turchyn belarus finished sixth in the olympic finalstill a teenager turchyn was the first of the juniors from komatsu to win a senior medal and despite the inevitable distractions he handled his sudden success better than most his coaches were relieved to see that their young star was still progressing well through the winter of 200405just how well was shown when turchyn beat the previously invincible raman piatrushenka in a 2005 belarus cup k1 200 m race a shocked reneysky called for a photofinish before confirming the result turchyn was typically unfazed by his victory and even had the temerity to look aggrieved when piatrushenka edged him out in the k1 1000 m final at the 2005 european championships again held in pozna the belarusians went one better than in 2004 taking the k4 500m gold medal ahead of slovakia this was a first senior title not just for turchyn but for his teammates too perhaps understandably they celebrated a little too enthusiastically with the result that they only came in fifth in the 200m final a month later they were world champions as well beating rivals slovakia at the world championships in zagreb croatia this was the first team kayak world title won by a belarus crew since independence but this time they delayed their celebrations and picked up a bronze medal in the 200 m final too the k4 crew were voted belarus sports team of the year 2005in 2006 they began in impressive form with victories at the poznan and duisburg regattas however reneysky then changed his strategy in preparation for the 2008 summer olympics with only one k4 event the 1000 m on the olympic schedule the k4 crew would not be entered for the 500m at the european and world championships this strategy was logical in that it allowed piatrushenka and makhneu the necessary rest time to compete in the k2 500 m it also allowed the formation of a second k4 500 m kayak crew to accommodate other upandcoming belarusian paddlers nonetheless it was hard on turchyn and abalmasau who were denied the chance to defend their hardwon titles of 2005at the european championships in raice czech republic turchyn and his teammates won an encouraging silver medal in the k4 1000 m behind slovakia this was their bestever result over 1000
