epistemology in science and religion world religions and the environment and religious and philosophical issues in medicinein spiritual transformations peters writes humanity religions exhibit many different ways of thinking about the sacred sometime it is thought of as many personal spiritual beings that underlie the working of nature and human life sometimes the sacred is thought of as one supreme reality the god of western monotheism or the tao in chinese thought the sacred can also be identified as the creativity in nature he references the thinking of arthur peacocke who had developed a form of scientific christian naturalism that stressed the immanence or ever presence of a god in the universe in dancing with the sacred peters proposes that the sacred is the dance of life a form of god he develops an understandable naturalistic theism in which the universe is not governed by a personal supernatural god this determination is not atheistic for the concept of the divine is preserved in a system of nonpersonal processes within the natural world nature produces variations that generate new aspects of existence that are creative but without design his thesis compliments the thinking of theologians such as henry nelson wieman and gordon kaufman and natural philosopher ralph wendell burhoepeters writes thatthe best kind of dancing is when no one leads when

he ran for the liberal party of canada in the riding of pembina he finished a distant second to progressive conservative jack biggbefore serving as mayor chalifoux was a city alderman and the assistant principal of st albert catholic high school in 1998 he defeated threeterm incumbent anita ratchinsky in an election whose major issue was the alignment of the proposed west regional road ratchinsky favoured a road that would bypass the developed portion of the city to the west by crossing the sturgeon river close to the mouth of big lake while chalifoux supported an alignment that would cross the river further upstreamduring chalifouxs time as mayor the road remained st alberts most contentious political issue city council approved chalifouxs preferred alignment by this time named ray gibbon drive however an aggressive public relations campaign by the riel park business association which did not like the way the proposed road would pass through riel business park and a group calling itself sensible choice attacked the alignment in the 2001 election chalifoux was defeated by former mayor dr richard plain who favoured the same alignment as ratchinsky and proposed a plebiscite on the subjectchalifoux challenged plain again in 2004 campaigning this time on issues other than the road saying that it was time to move on he won narrowly on may 22 2007 chalifoux announced that he would not seek reelection and in so doing provoke a third consecutive electoral battle against plain and would instead seek the nomination for the progressive conservatives in the next provincial election some perceived this as ironic given his past candidacy for the federal liberals and given that he had inadvertently implicated the city of st albert in a minor scandal when he attended a fundraiser for the alberta liberal party at the citys expense which violated provincial law chalifoux acknowledges that he has been a member of the liberal party at both the provincial and
