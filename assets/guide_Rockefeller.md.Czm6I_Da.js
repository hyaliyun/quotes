The smarter people are, the more they know how to be silent, just like mature rice, hanging down rice ears.</p><p>---002---</p><p>People who lack the ability to take action simply have one bad habit: they like to maintain the status quo and refuse to change.</p><p>---003---</p><p>I have a habit in my school. Before making a decision, I always think and judge calmly about my children. However, once I make a decision, I will not look back and stick to it.</p><p>---004---</p><p>Why will you still be able to learn independently? It is not right for children to learn independently without working hard. I despise those people who go with the flow and stick to the rules.</p><p>---005---</p><p>I despise those who make excuses for their bad behavior, because they think they are cowards. I also sympathize with those who make excuses for their bad behavior, because excuses are the source of failure in life.</p><p>---006---</p><p>This was a provocation from the public, but I pretended to be deaf to it. I knew that I respected myself, but I just wanted to learn from him. This was not the case. In my heart, I had already let go of the image. I kept telling myself: Surpassing is the best humiliation for you, and your strength is the loudest slap in your face.</p><p>---007---</p><p>However, those who have never experienced misfortune will only become more miserable.</p><p>---008---</p><p>If you want to become someone else, you must first make yourself admit the feeling of &quot;I am indeed the right person for the next step&quot;. You must always think so when you succeed. Not everyone thinks so.</p><p>---009---</p><p>Those who have the right to life but only care about success and have no education are mostly wastes, and those who have received education but only care about success but have no influence on their development are mostly worthless garbage.</p><p>---010---</p><p>A pig was praised after a good sleep and it was able to climb a tree.</p><p>---011---</p><p>You should be clear that knowledge is originally empty. Unless you put that knowledge into practice, what will happen to your children?</p><p>---012---</p><p>But a person only needs to have confidence in his life and doubt his own abilities sometimes, especially when facing adversity.</p><p>---013---</p><p>In the future, you will have the opportunity to learn, and there are too many opportunities to fight for. If you want to succeed, you must learn to grasp and protect your own opportunities, and also learn to try to snatch everyone else&#39;s opportunities.</p><p>---014---</p><p>We will learn from him that we will have the courage to make every choice and to be able to fight our way out of this difficult situation.</p><p>---015---</p><p>A person cannot succeed simply by luck; success requires hard work and a huge price to be paid.</p><p>---016---</p><p>This is not the right thing to do. Life is a process of continuous mortgage. We mortgage our youth for the future and our lives for happiness. If you dare not approach the bottom line, you will lose. Isn&#39;t it worth it to mortgage risks for success?</p><p>---017---</p><p>If you learn from him, you will succeed. You and your thoughts should move forward on a new path. If you don&#39;t learn from him, you will just follow the old path of success.</p><p>---018---</p><p>But no one can stop us from going home, unless we don&#39;t want to go home.</p><p>---019---</p><p>Dignity is not a gift from being a good person, nor is it given to everyone; it is something you create for yourself.</p><p>---020---</p><p>It is better to build friendship on the basis of business than to build business on the basis of friendship.</p><p>---021---</p><p>Those who climb up the mountain in the midst of suffering know how to use a thousand ways and a hundred tricks to look for all kinds of methods and means, and they will not be saved in the first place.</p><p>---022---</p><p>I will learn from him that others will know, but I will become sensitive to the way I am looked down upon by others, and I will lose my motivation in life because I will feel shorter than others.</p><p>---023---</p><p>But this inexplicable opportunity for the child may become a turning point in our lives.</p><p>---024---</p><p>Frankly speaking, when I felt that the poverty created by humans had turned into suffering, I began to have a belief: I want to be rich, but I have the right to be poor. As time goes by, this belief has become as strong as steel.</p><p>---025---</p><p>I have always thought about the children coming to school only to lose, but even if I lose, the only good thing is that I am optimistic about losing.</p><p>---026---</p><p>We pursue perfection, this is not a human nature but it is true that there is no such thing as absolute perfection, only near perfection.</p><p>---027---</p><p>But in the same way that things move and there are no results in learning, there is no good thing in learning that is not achieved by putting one idea into practice.</p><p>---028---</p><p>The pain of failure is part of business. We are only trying to strangle our opponents, but we have the determination to compete and fight to the end. Only a good country can be qualified as the loser.</p><p>---029---</p><p>But one thing is that I have learned a lot, but I have learned it for the sake of perfection. You can&#39;t afford the accumulation of all kinds of extra burdens in your life.</p><p>---030---</p><p>Think about it, we are like a mountain that will be used by you in the future. When our abilities and abilities are at your feet, you are destined to have children who are under your feet; when our abilities and abilities are at your feet, you are destined to have children who are under your feet. In the case of multiple children, this unpredictable arrangement of abilities and abilities also determines a good starting point for a child&#39;s life.</p><p>This doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s good or bad, but people&#39;s starting points are different, and their life results are different. At this moment, there is no such thing as poverty or wealth, nor is there such a thing as success or failure. There is only the moment of my struggle and success. I firmly believe that our destiny is determined by our actions, but success is not entirely determined by our actions.</p><p>---031---</p><p>I know that the quickest way to harm a child is to give him money. It can make him corrupt, domineering, and unruly, and take away the most beautiful happiness in your life.</p><p>---032---</p><p>The final reward of our labor is not what we earn, but what we become for our children. A good home and a good prison are built by ourselves. If you regard work as a pleasure, life will not be a good home; if you regard work as a duty, life will not be a good prison.</p><p>---033---</p><p>Charity is injurious unless it helps the recipient to become independent of it.</p><p>Charity is harmful unless it helps those who receive it not to become dependent on it.</p><p>---034---</p><p>A man must find his home, but that does not mean he becomes a wanderer or a beggar.</p><p>---035---</p><p>The great amount of energy and perseverance required to develop independent learning means setting specific goals and having a strong belief in surpassing oneself.</p><p>---036---</p><p>You hope that I can sail with you forever, which sounds good, but I am not your captain forever. God created feet for us, and I was born for him, but we have to rely on our own feet to sail for him.</p><p>---037---</p><p>A crutch cannot replace strong feet. We all learn to stand up on our own feet. If your feet are not strong enough and cannot support you, you are not doomed to fail. You just need to work hard to train, strengthen, and develop your feet so that they can play their full potential.</p><p>---038---</p><p>And no matter what happens in the future, we must never bet all our chips before the final outcome is revealed.</p><p>---039---</p><p>The most frustrating thing in life is to want to learn too much, but not have enough time to learn it. Instead, you think there are so many steps to complete the learning process, and you are overwhelmed by the feeling of not being able to learn it, so you fail to learn it. We must admit that time is limited, and we must not waste time to complete all the learning. Smart people know that not all actions can produce good results for children, only wise actions can bring meaningful results, so smart people only focus on absorbing work that can have a positive effect on children, and do work that is related to achieving the greatest goal. They are focused and dedicated, so smart people can make the most valuable contribution to their children and get the most benefits.</p><p>---040---</p><p>When a problem arises, don&#39;t just feel resentful and wonder how the situation can be improved and what actions can be taken to remedy or repair the mistake. At that time, you can have a completely honest assessment of your own role, and avoid meaningless behaviors such as empty prying to see what others have done well, or asking others to change for you.</p><p>Only when he focused on his own feeling, could he regain the Song Guan&#39;s possession of his hands.</p><p>Every time when we are in school, it is not about what we should learn and what we should do for the better of others. I should not complain about myself for the children, but about the success of the children. I should make myself stronger. The stronger I am, the smaller the influence on the children will be.</p><p>I think he can get an obstacle, he only sees the child as an opportunity for transformation, he only cares about the success of the country.</p><p>---041---</p><p>The way to avoid defensiveness is to open up and listen. In every conversation, the listener is the one who has the power, not the narrator.</p><p>Every time you listen correctly, you should not be defensive. Even if you don&#39;t like the information, you should still listen to understand it. Don&#39;t just focus on making an immediate response. Focusing on listening is not so much a skill as it is an attitude.</p><p>For a long time, we have shaped the lives of others and ourselves. This process must continue. We must eventually be responsible for our own choices and not let others decide the way we treat our children. We must refuse to blame others and lead them to the right path.</p><p>---042---</p><p>I no longer believe that failure in life is not the only way to success, I only believe that confidence is the only way to success!</p><p>---043---</p><p>I have never seen a man who was not greedy. - Rockefeller</p><p>---044---</p><p>People who only know how to work hard, the first thing they lose is the time to make money.</p><p>---045---</p><p>[Is insult an action?] There are times when we enjoy applause and cheers, because it is affirming our achievements, or affirming our qualities, personality and morality; there are also times when we are attacked and insulted. Apart from malicious intent, I think the reason why we insult children is that our abilities are not good enough. This ability may be related to the good character of the person, or it may be related to the good character of the person. The above does not constitute respect for others. Therefore, I want to say that being insulted is not a bad thing. If you are a person who knows how to reflect calmly, perhaps this kind of insult to a child is a yardstick to measure her ability, and I think this is her good character.</p><p>---046---</p><p>Fate does not give our children the first hope in life, but the opportunity to succeed.</p><p>---047---</p><p>And the energy that one wants to pay for is also a purchasable commodity, just like sugar or coffee. As long as I am willing to pay for this energy, it will naturally become a good thing for you and I will not use it every time.</p><p>---048---</p><p>Can you replace perseverance with a good student? Of course, it is not enough to just do it, because there are always people who are not qualified, and it is not enough to just study and achieve success; education is not enough, because there are too many people who are not qualified. Only perseverance and determination can make you happy.</p><p>---049---</p><p>The smarter a person is, the more he knows how to remain silent, just like mature rice with its ears of rice hanging down.</p><p>---050---</p><p>In my opinion, a happy life does not come from your bloodline, nor from the way you live, but only from your character - the spirit of self-discipline. Look at those people who have won the respect of others and displayed their charm everywhere, and we will know the value of self-discipline.</p><p>---051---</p><p>Rockefeller has a fable that has a profound meaning, which touched me deeply.</p><p>In ancient Europe, there was a man who found himself in a wonderful place where he could enjoy everything. As soon as he stepped into it, he felt like he was in paradise. And there came a person who looked like a waiter. Isn&#39;t this exactly what I dream of? He could taste all the delicacies and enjoy the beauty. But there was a time when he felt bored with all this, so he asked me to find a job there. &quot;</p><p>But he thought about it, and the answer he got was to shake his head: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, sir, this is the only thing we can&#39;t do for you. I can&#39;t give you a job.&quot;</p><p>The man was very frustrated and angrily waving his hands and saying, &quot;This is too bad. I might as well stay in jail for him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you think you are doing here?&quot; the waiter said gently, looking at him in a disrespectful manner.</p><p>---052---</p><p>People who own multiple companies are more likely to be optimistic about their children and fall into the so-called &quot;overconfidence&quot;. They may expect themselves to be a good businessman when they graduate, so that their children can succeed in the industry and the company can grow healthily. However, I dare not assert that initial success in a certain business does not mean that the business is successful.</p><p>---053---</p><p>But for those who have had unfortunate experiences, they will only become more miserable.</p><p>A person who thinks he is smart is a fool, and a person who is good enough to be a fool is only smart at some point in time.</p><p>---054---</p><p>Life is a process of continuous mortgage. For the future, we mortgage our youth, and for happiness, we mortgage our lives. If you dare not approach the bottom line, you will lose.</p><p>---055---</p><p>A person who is happy all the time is a person who can enjoy the creation of everything. Those who learn from others like a sponge, who only take and not give, only want to be happy in their lives.</p><p>---056---</p><p>Reserve potential is in line with the &quot;elasticity principle&quot; of management. The elasticity principle is a principle that is emphasized in management. It means to leave room for improvement and to prepare for the future. People know that there are many competitive factors for enterprises, some of which are deterministic and some are random; some are controllable and some are uncontrollable. This requires enterprises to be prepared for and prepare for unexpected events at any time. In terms of potential reserve, it can be considered as a kind of precaution and emergency, which can enable enterprises to &quot;make up for shortages with surpluses&quot; and help enterprises overcome difficulties. The &quot;elasticity principle&quot; is essentially to ensure that enterprises have enough reserves. In a certain sense, the reserves of enterprises are equivalent to the comprehensive reserves of enterprise potential.</p><p>---057---</p><p>The darkest moment is just before dawn.</p><p>---058---</p><p>He picked up a stupid pig and praised it, saying that it could also climb a tree.</p><p>---059---</p><p>A crutch cannot replace strong legs.
