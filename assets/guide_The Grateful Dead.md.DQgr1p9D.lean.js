Is anything going on there at all?</p><p>I want to exude strength and intelligence.</p><p>I like shows that have some level of intelligence to them.

In knowing, we are simply extending the intelligence that comes to and constitutes us. We mimic the mind of God, so to speak.

Then the warmth of friendship, and the intelligence received, most forcibly cooperate.</p><p>You&#39;ll remember Dr. Rice said that several times: It was not a warning about the place and the method and the time - it was a general warning.

I will say, however, that intelligence-community estimates should not become public in the way of this city and in the way of Congress.</p><p>The United States has done more for the war crimes tribunal than any other country in the world. We&#39;re turning over all the information we have, including intelligence information.</p><p>I&#39;m the chairman of the intelligence committee. We don&#39;t only get formal briefings, but we collect our information from the intelligence community in a variety of ways.</p><p>Intelligence is playing a more important role in policymaker decisions than I think I&#39;ve ever seen in my time in Congress or before.</p><p>Since September 11th Congress has created the Department of Homeland Security, more than doubled the homeland security budget and implemented a bipartisan overhaul of our intelligence systems.</p><p>Schools are not intended to moralize a wicked world, but to impart knowledge and develop intelligence, with only two social aims in mind: prepare to take on one&#39;s share in the world&#39;s work, and perhaps in addition, lend a hand in improving society, after schooling is done.</p><p>Man has made use of his intelligence, he invented stupidity.</p><p>These are Canadian and United States intelligence and law enforcement offices who are working in teams and who are using good intelligence and good law enforcement to really stop the criminals and terrorists before they ever get to the border.</p><p>I can tell you that the Canadian intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been providing outstanding co-operation with our intelligence and law enforcement agencies as we work together to track down terrorists here in North America and put them out of commission.</p><p>I can&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong about assuming intelligence in your audience and what&#39;s bad news about being rewarded for assuming that.</p><p>The rare person is still interested in new advances when they are adults. There is possibly a correlation with intelligence. In any case, you have to be fairly bright to keep learning and changing attitudes as you get older.</p><p>Facebook is at the forefront.

It can be the basis for artificial intelligence to develop over time.</p><p>There is huge demand for artificial intelligence technologies.</p><p>The employer class is less indispensable in the modern organization of industries because the laboring men themselves possess sufficient intelligence to organize into co-operative relation and enjoy the entire benefits of their own labor.</p><p>The right of each individual in any relation to secure to himself the full benefits of his intelligence, his capacity, his industry and skill are among the inalienable inheritances of humanity.</p><p>A great many people think that polysyllables are a sign of intelligence.</p><p>It is conceded by all that man is the very highest type of all living creatures on the earth. His intelligence is far superior to that of any other earthly being.</p><p>I absolutely don&#39;t think a sentient artificial intelligence is going to wage war against the human species.</p><p>The exact measure of the progress of civilization is the degree in which the intelligence of the common mind has prevailed over wealth and brute force.</p><p>To attempt to superimpose its views through the exercise of force, is seldom the part of intelligence it is frequently the part of ignorance.</p><p>Guantanamo allows us to secure dangerous detainees without the risk of escape, while at the same time providing us with valuable intelligence information on how best to proceed in the war against terror and prevent future attacks.</p><p>Reputation is favorable notoriety as distinguished from fame, which is permanent approval of great deeds and noble thoughts by the best intelligence of mankind.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how to depict intelligence.</p><p>Our intelligence community needs better coordination of operations and exchange of information, and that&#39;s why we need an overall director of national intelligence and a national counterterrorism center.</p><p>I strongly support the call to greatly expand our human intelligence capability to penetrate al Qaeda and gather critical intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks on our homeland.</p><p>Improving our national intelligence capabilities should remain a top priority and a continual process.</p><p>The war on terror, I believe, will be waged by effective intelligence and police work and cruise missiles.</p><p>I do not want to go into its physical reasons: the construction of the human body is different from that of carnivorous animals.

The real intelligence in the royal family comes through my parents to Prince Philip and the children.</p><p>Ron Howard is as good a person as you could want to work with on film. He never lost his cool. He&#39;s the most easygoing, lovely man, but he&#39;s got this enormous intelligence and a wonderful humanity.</p><p>Oprah is so bright, and her intelligence is so piercing that I don&#39;t think anyone who spends a few minutes with her isn&#39;t struck by that.</p><p>When I resigned, I put the U.S. Government on notice that I&#39;m going to stick to policy issues, that I have no intention of going out and blowing the cover off of the intelligence operations, that those are truly sensitive and they should not be exposed.</p><p>The original PATRIOT Act greatly increased our nation&#39;s ability to share intelligence information, made better use of technology, and provided terrorism investigators tools that have long been available in cases involving illegal drugs and organized crime.</p><p>We can&#39;t gather the intelligence we need to foil future attacks, if we are blindly granting terrorists the right to remain silent. But for some reason, we&#39;ve already done that - with the terrorist who tried to bring down Flight 253.</p><p>Everyone I know who used to be in the intelligence community is moving into the corporate world.</p><p>I do not - I never believed it&#39;s better to kill a terrorist than to detain him. We want to detain as many terrorists as possible so we can elicit the intelligence from them in the appropriate manner so that we can disrupt follow-on terrorist attacks.</p><p>The actions that we take on the counterterrorism front, again, are to take actions against individuals where we believe that the intelligence base is so strong and the nature of the threat is so grave and serious, as well as imminent, that we have no recourse except to take this action that may involve a lethal strike.</p><p>We are in this business, whether it be intelligence or the government, to protect freedom, democracy and liberty, not to violate that.</p><p>I will not, nor will I ever, publicly divulge sensitive intelligence sources and methods.

It&#39;s about character, it&#39;s about behavior. They understand things about people that I simply don&#39;t see.</p><p>When I was the director of Central Intelligence in the early &#39;90s, I tried to get the Air Force to partner with us in building drones. And they didn&#39;t want to, because they had no pilots.</p><p>But it is equally incontrovertible that if our intelligence gathering process is seriously flawed, we had better find out and find out fast if we are to avoid another Sept. 11.</p><p>The prompt assimilation of that intelligence will be essential if we are to avoid another September 11th.</p><p>Some of the best fan mail I get are from our men and women in the military and intelligence communities. They say, &#39;Boy you do your homework, this is exactly how we&#39;re doing it.&#39;</p><p>The Patriot Act removed major legal barriers that prevented the law enforcement, intelligence, and national defense communities from talking and coordinating their work to protect the American people and our national security.</p><p>I sought Ben Affleck because I needed an everyman for this role. Ben appeals to men and women. He gives you a sense of intelligence, the notion of a guy who can think on his feet.</p><p>People&#39;s intelligence tends to be in inverse proportion to their number. People don&#39;t tend to get smarter as they get into bigger groups.</p><p>I take parenting incredibly seriously.

That responsibility has waned in the last year as military and intelligence resources were withdrawn from Afghanistan and Pakistan to be used in Iraq.</p><p>We need to make a greater investment in human intelligence.</p><p>During the Cold War, we gathered information by listening to the Soviets, taking pictures of the Soviets, and we allowed our human intelligence to decline.</p><p>This president has been reluctant to hold anybody accountable. No one was held accountable after September the 11th. Nobody&#39;s been held accountable after the clear flaws in intelligence leading up to the war in Iraq.</p><p>In reality, serial killers are of average intelligence.</p><p>The PATRIOT Act brought down the wall separating intelligence agencies from law enforcement and other entities charged with protecting the Nation from terrorism.</p><p>Legislation passed in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 enhanced our intelligence capabilities and strengthened our national defense, but until now our nation&#39;s immigration policies have not adapted to the needs of a post-September 11th world.</p><p>The great corporations of this country were not founded by ordinary people.

It might sound stupid, but it means not only are they fun to live with on a tour bus for years, but humor implies intelligence.</p><p>George Tenet has been the director of central intelligence since 1997, time enough to have changed the Agency&#39;s culture.

Bush brushed off that intelligence briefing of Aug. 6, 2001, &#39;Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.&#39; But surely a big distraction was the major speech he was readying for delivery on Aug. 9, his first prime-time address to the nation.</p><p>They have involved co-operation between the Iraqi intelligence and al-Qaeda operatives on training and combined operations regarding bomb making and chemical and biological weapons.</p><p>Terrorists continue to exploit divisions between law enforcement and the intelligence communities that limit the sharing of vital counterterrorism information.</p><p>We&#39;ve done it in intelligence sharing and certain elements of security. There were parts of the department, in fact, that worked very well in Katrina, like the Coast Guard and TSA.</p><p>There is no one, who possesses intelligence and uses reflection, who does not understand that it is one Being who both created all things and governs them with the same energy by which He created them.</p><p>You mustn&#39;t underestimate an audience&#39;s intelligence.</p><p>Well, first of all, we did lots of studies where we show practical intelligence doesn&#39;t correlate with G.

Sensibility is surrendering to intelligence.</p><p>Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence.</p><p>But every time our ability to access information and to communicate it to others is improved, in some sense we have achieved an increase over natural intelligence.</p><p>I am suggesting that we recognize that in network and interface research there is something as profound (and potential wild) as Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>If you imagine someone with 100 percent determination and 100 percent intelligence, you can discard a lot of intelligence before they stop succeeding. But if you start discarding determination, you very quickly get an ineffectual and perpetual grad student.</p><p>The intelligence failures with respect to Iraq were massive and have damaged our credibility around the world.</p><p>When a decision is made to go to war based on intelligence, it is a fateful decision.

That means power over the intelligence budget.

That is why young children, before they are aware of their own self-importance, learn so easily.</p><p>Leadership is influence.</p><p>Leadership is diving for a loose ball, getting the crowd involved, getting other players involved. It&#39;s being able to take it as well as dish it out. That&#39;s the only way you&#39;re going to get respect from the players.</p><p>No matter how carefully you plan your goals they will never be more than pipe dreams unless you pursue them with gusto.</p><p>How we think shows through in how we act. Attitudes are mirrors of the mind. They reflect thinking.</p><p>Go as far as you can see when you get there, you&#39;ll be able to see farther.</p><p>A leader does not deserve the name unless he is willing occasionally to stand alone.</p><p>Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.</p><p>The art of leadership is saying no, not saying yes. It is very easy to say yes.</p><p>Making good decisions is a crucial skill at every level.</p><p>People buy into the leader before they buy into the vision.</p><p>The real leader has no need to lead - he is content to point the way.</p><p>Without initiative, leaders are simply workers in leadership positions.</p><p>There are three secrets to managing. The first secret is have patience. The second is be patient. And the third most important secret is patience.</p><p>No person will make a great business who wants to do it all himself or get all the credit.</p><p>Luck is a dividend of sweat. The more you sweat, the luckier you get.</p><p>Everyone who&#39;s ever taken a shower has an idea.

With courage and initiative, leaders change things.</p><p>Leaders must encourage their organizations to dance to forms of music yet to be heard.</p><p>Clarity affords focus.</p><p>I&#39;m not a natural leader. I&#39;m too intellectual I&#39;m too abstract I think too much.</p><p>The employer generally gets the employees he deserves.</p><p>Obstacles are things a person sees when he takes his eyes off his goal.</p><p>If you have ideas, you have the main asset you need, and there isn&#39;t any limit to what you can do with your business and your life. Ideas are any man&#39;s greatest asset.</p><p>I look for what needs to be done. After all, that&#39;s how the universe designs itself.</p><p>Today a reader, tomorrow a leader.</p><p>Think little goals and expect little achievements.

America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I, therefore, intend to oppose the effort to increase America&#39;s debt.</p><p>Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.</p><p>The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office.</p><p>We can&#39;t drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times... and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK. That&#39;s not leadership. That&#39;s not going to happen.</p><p>But the person who scored well on an SAT will not necessarily be the best doctor or the best lawyer or the best businessman. These tests do not measure character, leadership, creativity, perseverance.</p><p>You learn far more from negative leadership than from positive leadership. Because you learn how not to do it. And, therefore, you learn how to do it.</p><p>Educationists should build the capacities of the spirit of inquiry, creativity, entrepreneurial and moral leadership among students and become their role model.</p><p>Leadership is a privilege to better the lives of others. It is not an opportunity to satisfy personal greed.</p><p>You don&#39;t lead by hitting people over the head - that&#39;s assault, not leadership.</p><p>Men make history and not the other way around. In periods where there is no leadership, society stands still. Progress occurs when courageous, skillful leaders seize the opportunity to change things for the better.</p><p>Leadership is a potent combination of strategy and character. But if you must be without one, be without the strategy.</p><p>No institution can possibly survive if it needs geniuses or supermen to manage it.

And acting alone, accept everything alone.</p><p>In giving us children, God places us in a position of both leadership and service. He calls us to give up our lives for someone else&#39;s sake - to abandon our own desires and put our child&#39;s interests first. Yet, according to His perfect design, it is through this selflessness that we can become truly fulfilled.</p><p>God will never direct us to be prideful, arrogant and unforgiving, immoral or slothful or full of fear.

If you&#39;re in control, they&#39;re in control.</p><p>Leadership to me means duty, honor, country. It means character, and it means listening from time to time.</p><p>A functioning, robust democracy requires a healthy educated, participatory followership, and an educated, morally grounded leadership.</p><p>The growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.</p><p>Leadership in today&#39;s world requires far more than a large stock of gunboats and a hard fist at the conference table.</p><p>Leadership is getting players to believe in you. If you tell a teammate you&#39;re ready to play as tough as you&#39;re able to, you&#39;d better go out there and do it. Players will see right through a phony. And they can tell when you&#39;re not giving it all you&#39;ve got.</p><p>I have a different vision of leadership. A leadership is someone who brings people together.</p><p>Black leadership has to recognize that principles more than speech, character more than a claim, is greater in advancing the cause of our liberation than what has transpired thus far.</p><p>Leadership is an opportunity to serve. It is not a trumpet call to self-importance.</p><p>Half a century ago, the amazing courage of Rosa Parks, the visionary leadership of Martin Luther King, and the inspirational actions of the civil rights movement led politicians to write equality into the law and make real the promise of America for all her citizens.</p><p>All of the great leaders have had one characteristic in common: it was the willingness to confront unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time. This, and not much else, is the essence of leadership.</p><p>Leadership can not be measured in a poll or even in the result of an election. It can only be truly seen with the benefit of time. From the perspective of 20 years, not 20 days.</p><p>The function of leadership is to produce more leaders, not more followers.</p><p>The secret to success is good leadership, and good leadership is all about making the lives of your team members or workers better.</p><p>I start with the premise that the function of leadership is to produce more leaders, not more followers.</p><p>Millions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can&#39;t find the work they studied for, or any work at all. So here&#39;s the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?</p><p>Leadership consists not in degrees of technique but in traits of character it requires moral rather than athletic or intellectual effort, and it imposes on both leader and follower alike the burdens of self-restraint.</p><p>Leadership is getting someone to do what they don&#39;t want to do, to achieve what they want to achieve.</p><p>I speak directly to the people, and I know that the people of California want to have better leadership. They want to have great leadership. They want to have somebody that will represent them. And it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a Democrat or a Republican, young or old.</p><p>I think we need the feminine qualities of leadership, which include attention to aesthetics and the environment, nurturing, affection, intuition and the qualities that make people feel safe and cared for.</p><p>This assumption of Negro leadership in the ghetto, then, must not be confined to matters of religion, education, and social uplift it must deal with such fundamental forces in life as make these things possible.</p><p>One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency.</p><p>We live in a society obsessed with public opinion.

To lead a President must persuade. Personal contacts and experiences help shape his thinking. They can be critical to his persuasiveness and thus to his leadership.</p><p>The secret to understanding me is, I&#39;m not trying to be anybody other than who I actually am. People want candid, refreshing leadership. And I&#39;ve always tried to go with solutions. You know, I&#39;ve always tried to say, here&#39;s how we get our economy growing, here&#39;s why we get our debt under control. That&#39;s what Mitt Romney is offering.</p><p>What&#39;s missing is leadership in the White House. And the story that Barack Obama does tell, forever shifting blame to the last administration, is getting old. The man assumed office almost four years ago - isn&#39;t it about time he assumed responsibility?</p><p>My philosophy of leadership is to surround myself with good people who have ability, judgment and knowledge, but above all, a passion for service.</p><p>The biggest difference is in the leadership.

Occasionally they are necessary to leadership.</p><p>The key to successful leadership today is influence, not authority.</p><p>Charlatanism of some degree is indispensable to effective leadership.</p><p>There&#39;s a void of leadership in a lot of Washington. I think one of the reasons why there&#39;s so much angst across the country.</p><p>Absolute identity with one&#39;s cause is the first and great condition of successful leadership.</p><p>Honor bespeaks worth. Confidence begets trust. Service brings satisfaction. Cooperation proves the quality of leadership.</p><p>Presidential leadership needn&#39;t always cost money. Look for low- and no-cost options. They can be surprisingly effective.</p><p>Military school was great and especially great for leadership and then I spent two years in Vietnam.</p><p>So here&#39;s the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?</p><p>Well football teams are perhaps easier to control than political parties, I&#39;m sure the Prime Minister would agree with me, but yeah I think every team needs discipline and a sense of self-belief and that&#39;s important, that&#39;s what leadership&#39;s all about.</p><p>Humility is a great quality of leadership which derives respect and not just fear or hatred.</p><p>What we heard today was not fiscal leadership from our Commander-in-Chief, what we heard today was a political broadside from our Campaigner-in-Chief.</p><p>We need leadership. We don&#39;t need a doubling down on the failed politics of the past.</p><p>Hope and change? We&#39;re not doing that anymore. They&#39;re doing attack and blame. And so, I just think people are going to see through this. They want real leadership. They want us to get this country on the right track.</p><p>A leader is one who, out of madness or goodness, volunteers to take upon himself the woe of the people. There are few men so foolish, hence the erratic quality of leadership in the world.</p><p>Leadership can&#39;t be fabricated. If it is fabricated and rehearsed, you can&#39;t fool the guys in the locker room. So when you talk about leadership, it comes with performance. Leadership comes with consistency.</p><p>If you don&#39;t understand that you work for your mislabeled &#39;subordinates,&#39; then you know nothing of leadership. You know only tyranny.</p><p>Ever since Israel has been a nation the United States has provided the leadership. Every president down to the ages has done this in a fairly balanced way, including George Bush senior, Gerald Ford, and others including myself and Bill Clinton.</p><p>Overall, the challenge of leadership is both moral and one of developing the characteristics that make us respected by one another.</p><p>The task of leadership is not to put greatness into humanity, but to elicit it, for the greatness is already there.</p><p>In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity.</p><p>They said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics, to take on public-sector unions and to reform a pension and health benefits system that was headed to bankruptcy. But with bipartisan leadership, we saved taxpayers $132 billion dollars over 30 years and saved retirees their pensions. We did it.</p><p>But I do not believe that the world would be entirely different if there were more women leaders. Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman, you might not get into the conflicts in the first place. But if you watch the women who have made it to the top, they haven&#39;t exactly been non-aggressive - including me.</p><p>There are many elements to a campaign. Leadership is number one. Everything else is number two.</p><p>Leadership does not depend on being right.</p><p>Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman, you might not get into the conflicts in the first place. But if you watch the women who have made it to the top, they haven&#39;t exactly been non-aggressive - including me.</p><p>I emphasize self-esteem, self-confidence, and dignity, not as an ideal, but as a real test of community organization. Without leadership development, community organizations do not have staying power.</p><p>Many corporate leaders and employees have the right intentions, but it can be overwhelming when you consider how everything is affected from leadership styles, to organizational structure, to employee engagement, to customer service an marketplace.</p><p>The one thing that the President can do is to establish a real energy independence plan. We have all the recources we need right here in this country to establish energy independence if we had the leadership.</p><p>The trouble with the Labour Party leadership and the trade union leadership, they&#39;re quite willing to applaud millions on the streets of the Philippines or in Eastern Europe, without understanding the need to also produce millions of people on the streets of Britain.</p><p>Yes, America must do the right thing, but to provide moral leadership, America must do it in the right way, too.</p><p>To my mind the election was stolen by George Bush and we have been suffering ever since under this man&#39;s leadership.</p><p>Nixon was an awful president in many ways, including in some of his foreign-policy choices. But he left no doubt that foreign policy and America&#39;s leadership in the world outside its borders was of paramount importance to him.</p><p>Leadership is hard to define and good leadership even harder. But if you can get people to follow you to the ends of the earth, you are a great leader.</p><p>We are watching industries crumble, Wall Street firms disappear, unemployment spike, and unprecedented government intervention. And our designated opinion leaders want to know: Is Obama up this week? Is he down? And is his leadership style more like Bill Clinton&#39;s, or Abraham Lincoln&#39;s?</p><p>The signs of outstanding leadership appear primarily among the followers. Are the followers reaching their potential? Are they learning? Serving? Do they achieve the required results? Do they change with grace? Manage conflict?</p><p>The only safe ship in a storm is leadership.</p><p>The democratic idealist is prone to make light of the whole question of standards and leadership because of his unbounded faith in the plain people.</p><p>With gridlock the norm, Congress&#39;s approval rating is below 10 percent and the public has lost faith in its national leadership.</p><p>Washington&#39;s answer to a self-inflicted financial crisis reminded Americans why they so deeply distrust the political class. The &#39;fiscal cliff&#39; process was secretive and sloppy, and the nation&#39;s so-called leadership lacked the political courage to address our root problems: joblessness and debt.</p><p>Leadership comes in small acts as well as bold strokes.</p><p>If a guy is intimidated by a woman in leadership, he has real problems with his own concepts of masculinity. That&#39;s a harsh statement, but I believe it to be true.</p><p>I want American Dream growth - lots of new businesses, well-paying jobs, and American leadership in new industries, like clean energy and biotechnology.</p><p>The more that social democracy develops, grows, and becomes stronger, the more the enlightened masses of workers will take their own destinies, the leadership of their movement, and the determination of its direction into their own hands.</p><p>I am endlessly fascinated that playing football is considered a training ground for leadership, but raising children isn&#39;t. Hey, it made me a better leader: you have to take a lot of people&#39;s needs into account you have to look down the road. Trying to negotiate getting a couple of kids to watch the same TV show requires serious diplomacy.</p><p>My observation is that women are merely waiting for their husbands to assume leadership.</p><p>The Irish Republican Army has kept every commitment made by its leadership.</p><p>I believe that the capacity that any organisation needs is for leadership to appear anywhere it is needed, when it is needed.</p><p>I think it is quite dangerous for an organisation to think they can predict where they are going to need leadership. It needs to be something that people are willing to assume if it feels relevant, given the context of any situation.</p><p>I think a major act of leadership right now, call it a radical act, is to create the places and processes so people can actually learn together, using our experiences.</p><p>Most people associate command and control leadership with the military.</p><p>The cardinal responsibility of leadership is to identify the dominant contradiction at each point of the historical process and to work out a central line to resolve it.</p><p>It&#39;s really necessary for the United States to continue to give strong leadership to the Middle East peace process, supported by European countries at the same time.</p><p>Leadership cannot just go along to get along. Leadership must meet the moral challenge of the day.</p><p>Leadership is intangible, and therefore no weapon ever designed can replace it.</p><p>I think one of the keys to leadership is recognizing that everybody has gifts and talents.

This family has had the burden of leadership on its shoulders for 1,400 years. I&#39;m not going to drop the ball on my shift.</p><p>I think President Obama could have handled politics and policies differently. But he has been decisive, strong, and consistent - important qualities in a president. Mitt Romney is indeed an Etch A Sketch, the antithesis of leadership.</p><p>I think directors should be confident in their leadership capabilities. I think directors should be confident in what they want to do.</p><p>It simply cannot be disputed that for decades the Palestinian leadership was more interested in there not being a Jewish state than in there being a Palestinian state.</p><p>Now, do I think there has to be shared sacrifice among other nations in the world who want a stable and secure world? Absolutely, there has to be. But I don&#39;t think that America can ever abdicate its leadership role in the world because of who we are and where we&#39;ve come from. We are the symbol for the world for freedom and liberty.</p><p>If anybody ran a business like that they would be out of business quickly, and Barack Obama&#39;s leadership is driving this business, the United States of America, toward a fiscal cliff.</p><p>I think it is important to ask ourselves as citizens, not as Democrats attacking the administration, but as citizens, whether a world power can really provide global leadership on the basis of fear and anxiety?</p><p>Leadership is an ever-evolving position.</p><p>True leadership lies in guiding others to success. In ensuring that everyone is performing at their best, doing the work they are pledged to do and doing it well.</p><p>If we are to negotiate the coming years safely, we may need a new kind of leadership. To put it more precisely, we need the rediscovery of an ancient kind of leadership that has rarely been given the prominence it deserves.

He is a very wise man of great inner peace who believes that happiness is the purpose of our lives. Through his teachings and leadership, he continues to make this world a better place in which to live.</p><p>The most dangerous leadership myth is that leaders are born-that there is a genetic factor to leadership. This myth asserts that people simply either have certain charismatic qualities or not. That&#39;s nonsense in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders are made rather than born.</p><p>But the fact is that the vast majority of Republicans support the Sinn Fein leadership.</p><p>Leadership that exploits and sacrifices young people on the altar of its goals is nothing more than raw, demonic power. Genuine leadership is found in ceaseless efforts to foster young people, to pave the way forward for them.</p><p>Where there is an absence of international political leadership, civil society should step in to fill the gap, providing the energy and vision needed to move the world in a new and better direction.</p><p>The role of leadership is to transform the complex situation into small pieces and prioritize them.</p><p>Moreover, as the leadership of the House confirmed last year, the Administration remains opposed to a congressional resolution on the Armenian Genocide due to Turkish objections.

Their labor puts food on our table and fuel in our gas tanks. Their service in our military sets a powerful example of leadership, honor and sacrifice.

Of course, I don&#39;t think they believe that. It&#39;s just an argument that&#39;s made when you can&#39;t confront the truth and facts. They really want to maintain power.</p><p>There are no ideas in the Republican Party right now in the Congress. They&#39;re the party of no. They desperately need some intellectual leadership. And whatever you think of Newt Gingrich, he can supply intellectual leadership. So I hope he does run.</p><p>The fact is, when it comes to economic leadership, the Republicans have nothing to brag about. This isn&#39;t what the American people want. They want to see progress that works for them.</p><p>Democrats are going to proudly run on the fact that we turned the economy around. It was our policies under President Obama&#39;s leadership through the Recovery Act, through investing in the automobile industry.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the House right now seems to have been strangled by the tea party.</p><p>Aren&#39;t we at the point where the closer we get to chaos, the more concern that there should be about coming to the table and compromising with Democrats? This is not leadership. This is almost like dictatorship.</p><p>We&#39;ve been sitting at the compromise table for a long time. We&#39;re just waiting for that cold chair to be warmed up by the Republican leadership. They still have time to do the right thing and be responsible. They just seem to be moving further and further away from it.</p><p>The art of communication is the language of leadership.</p><p>All Americans and freedom-loving people around the world owe President Reagan our deepest gratitude for his strong, principled leadership that ended the Cold War and brought freedom to millions of people.</p><p>Real leadership is leaders recognizing that they serve the people that they lead.</p><p>China and India will take the global leadership on climate change: they are suffering for it.</p><p>President Bush has shown great leadership. He has said that the 21st century will not be ruled or dictated by terrorists, dictators, and murderers. He is absolutely right. God bless him for his resolve.</p><p>President Obama chose politics over leadership. &#39;Hope&#39; and &#39;Change&#39; have become bait-and-switch.</p><p>This is easy to say with the benefit of hindsight, but I think it once again points out how very important style of leadership, that is the way he does what he does, is to his perception.</p><p>Research has shown that the perceived style of leadership is by far the most important thing to most voters in evaluating officeholders and candidates.</p><p>If you can provide the funding and you get the leadership, you&#39;ll have a competitive team.</p><p>I urge the Iraqi leadership for sake of its own people... to seize this opportunity and thereby begin to end the isolation and suffering of the Iraqi people.</p><p>At that time, the army leadership said the implementation of this agreement would allow everyone, including the IRA, to take its political objectives forward by peaceful and democratic means.</p><p>Sinn Fein has demonstrated the ability to play a leadership role as part of a popular movement towards peace, equality and justice.</p><p>I know of no single formula for success.

You can&#39;t blow an uncertain trumpet.</p><p>I wish I had played team sports. I think every kid should. Teamwork builds character - teaches people about leadership and cooperation.</p><p>I took a gamble to exercise leadership without losing my feminine nature.</p><p>As a vibrant force in civil society, women continue to press for their rights, equal participation in decision-making, and the upholding of the principles of the revolution by the highest levels of leadership in Egypt.</p><p>I believe that in Europe, we have a collective leadership.</p><p>So I think democracy, in the long-term, in our countries will survive if it comes to be associated with leadership, will not survive if democracy plus media brings to us more and more followship rather than leadership.</p><p>One secret of leadership is that the mind of a leader never turns off. Leaders even when they are sightseers or spectators, are active not passive observers.</p><p>The more consistent a father can be or a mentor can be in the person&#39;s life and teach them principles of real solid manhood, character, integrity and leadership, the more consistent you can be in the person&#39;s life and teach them those things at a younger age, and then the better off they&#39;ll be.</p><p>If people want to compete for leadership of a religious group, they can compete in piety. A chilling thought. Or funny.</p><p>The message of the free world to any potential Palestinian leadership should be a simple one: Embrace democratic reform and we will embrace you.</p><p>There was great leadership in this country at the time of World War II. There was also unrelenting resolve at home, in America&#39;s factories and on the farms, in the cities and the country.</p><p>The things journalists should pay attention to are the issues the political leadership agrees on, rather than to their supposed antagonisms.</p><p>Clearly you need a new team to go out to bat on your behalf to fight for your rights and to report back to you personally and to the leadership of the IFP.</p><p>Sometimes leadership is planting trees under whose shade you&#39;ll never sit. It may not happen fully till after I&#39;m gone. But I know that the steps we&#39;re taking are the right steps.</p><p>I have never been afraid to stand up to the leadership on issues where we disagree. If you chose to keep Cambridge Labour, then I can continue to press the Government for the things that matter to you, in a way that members of the opposition are unable to.</p><p>Obama is thoroughly mixed up with all these things he&#39;s got. He&#39;s got to solve Libya. He&#39;s got to solve Afghanistan. He&#39;s everywhere. And this nation, I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s not showing the leadership and capacity to attend different issues at the same time.</p><p>What nourishes us at home and in school is what inspires us. When we get awareness and learn about the great potential that we all human beings have, we are able to discover our leadership.</p><p>Half a world away nations that once lived under oppression and tyranny are now budding democracies due in large part to America &#39;s leadership and the sacrifices of our military.</p><p>There was no imminent threat. This was made up in Texas, announced in January to the Republican leadership that war was going to take place and was going to be good politically.

That&#39;s not leadership. Loose regulations and lax enforcement. That&#39;s not leadership. That&#39;s abandoning our middle class.</p><p>I&#39;m not up on the Internet, but I hear that is a democratic possibility. People can connect with each other. I think people are ready for something, but there is no leadership to offer it to them. People are ready to say, &#39;Yes, we are part of a world.&#39;</p><p>Leadership requires the courage to make decisions that will benefit the next generation.</p><p>We&#39;re in a leadership position in sports. People look up to the National Football League.</p><p>And the whole world, the whole world that believes in freedom, whether you&#39;re talking about personal freedom, economic freedom, religious freedom, they look to the United States for leadership and you&#39;re part of that leadership.</p><p>An old African leader says about leadership, he says that leadership should never be shared it should always remain in the hands of the dispossessed people. We will lead the revolution.</p><p>Divorced from ethics, leadership is reduced to management and politics to mere technique.</p><p>Leadership should be born out of the understanding of the needs of those who would be affected by it.</p><p>I think what actually works best is local-level individual targeting of key leadership nodes.</p><p>As for leadership, I am the kind who leads reluctantly and more by example than anything else. Someone had to be on the incorporation papers as president.</p><p>The current leadership of the Labor party react to the idea that working-class students might study the subjects they studied with the same horror that the Earl of Grantham showed when a chauffeur wanted to marry his daughter.</p><p>Labor, under their current leadership, want to be the Downtown Abbey party when it comes to educational opportunity. They think working class children should stick to the station in life they were born into - they should be happy to be recognized for being good with their hands and not presume to get above themselves.</p><p>I believe that we as the leader of the Free World must provide important leadership on the ethical parameters, the ethical constraints that this research requires.</p><p>We should see the leadership from the White House setting dates certain for certain goals of achieving greater alliance on alternative and renewable energy sources, but we are not.</p><p>Turnaround or growth, it&#39;s getting your people focused on the goal that is still the job of leadership.</p><p>Not everybody is created equal, and it&#39;s important for companies to identify those high potentials and treat them differently, accelerate their development and pay them more.

That&#39;s leadership.</p><p>Bipartisanship isn&#39;t an option anymore it is a requirement. The American people have divided responsibility for leadership right down the middle.</p><p>All of this suggests that while citizens became more comfortable with President Bush after September 11 and thought him to have the requisite leadership skills, they continue to harbor doubts about his priorities, loyalties, interests, and policies.</p><p>Every time you have to speak, you are auditioning for leadership.</p><p>And I&#39;d say one of the great lessons I&#39;ve learned over the past couple of decades, from a management perspective, is that really when you come down to it, it really is all about people and all about leadership.</p><p>Such manifestations I account as representing the creative leadership of the new forces of thought and appreciation which attend changes in technological pattern and therefore of the pattern of human relationships in society.</p><p>I think most Americans understand that we went through a period in which American leadership was judged quite critically internationally.</p><p>I think the greater responsibility, in terms of morality, is where leadership begins.</p><p>In the area we&#39;re discussing, leadership begins on Madison Avenue, on the desks and in the offices of people who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying what will get them ratings.</p><p>In this nation, leadership is dollars.</p><p>In terms of having views and being prepared to express them, yes, I think New Zealand&#39;s had a leadership role in a lot of things.</p><p>In addition to removing our democratically elected government, Israel wants to sow dissent among Palestinians by claiming that there is a serious leadership rivalry among us. I am compelled to dispel this notion definitively.</p><p>If Ralph Nader runs, President Bush is going to be re-elected, and if Ralph Nader doesn&#39;t run, President Bush is going to be re-elected. We&#39;re going to run on the president&#39;s strong and principled leadership and his positive agenda for a second term.</p><p>So I think that our foreign policy, the president&#39;s strong and principled leadership when it comes to the war against terror and foreign policy is going to be an asset.</p><p>Many citizens see all the leadership of these large institutions together in a conspiracy against them rather than in any adversary relationship with each other.</p><p>As far as Iraq, the important thing is that the Taliban is gone in Afghanistan, three-quarters of the al-Qaida leadership is either dead or in jail, and we now have Saudi Arabia working with us, Pakistan working with us.</p><p>But 85 percent of the mosques have extremist leadership in this country. Most Muslims, the overwhelming majority of Muslims, are loyal Americans.</p><p>And if the imam and the Muslim leadership in that community is so intent on building bridges, then they should voluntarily move the mosque away from ground zero and move it whether it&#39;s uptown or somewhere else, but move it away from that area, the same as the pope directed the Carmelite nuns to move a convent away from Auschwitz.</p><p>Democrats have no agenda, no plan for the future, and no sense of leadership.</p><p>We have treated our most serious adversaries, such as Iran and North Korea, in the most juvenile manner - by giving them the silent treatment. In so doing, we have weakened, not strengthened, our bargaining position and our leadership.</p><p>I mean, Emily Harris was his wife. And she seemed to resent his leadership, but on the other hand, she felt like a good soldier, that he had to be the leader.</p><p>We live in a time where government is not a leadership thing, it&#39;s more a business that&#39;s out there and running riot, so I guess the people have to go out there and say stuff.</p><p>President Ford was a devoted, decent man of impeccable integrity who put service to his country before his own self interest. He helped heal our nation during a time of crisis, provided steady leadership and restored people&#39;s faith in the presidency and in government.</p><p>Under the leadership of this President, the state of the union is not strong. We are being pulled apart rather than pulling together. Our democracy is suffering from the choices being made, and yet we are offered the same tired excuses and unrealistic analyses.</p><p>I believe it is time for new leadership that is able to leave the &#39;70s behind.</p><p>The problem is, is that President Bush and the Republican leadership in the Congress have resisted attempts to increase dramatically our fuel economy standards over the last five years.</p><p>The leadership lost its nerve. Instead of taking the lead in the reform movement... they pulled the plug on it. They tried and are still trying to return the church to the dry ice of the previous century and a half.</p><p>President Reagan was a leader at a time when the American people most needed leadership. He outlined a vision that captured the imagination of the free world, a vision that toppled the Communist empire and freed countless millions.</p><p>There is no international problem that can be addressed or solved without the engagement and leadership of the United States and everybody in the world knows that, its just fact of life. So sometimes I think we could conduct ourselves with a little more humility.</p><p>Well, I&#39;ve ruffled a few feathers at all the institutions I&#39;ve led. But I think that&#39;s part of leadership.</p><p>I think our leadership team is a highly accountable leadership team.</p><p>Dr. King&#39;s leadership reaffirmed the promise of our democracy: that everyday people, working together, have the power to change our government and our institutions for the better.</p><p>One of the surest signs of the estimated changes in the consciousness of the American proletariat is to be found in the character of the demands now being put forward by the leadership.</p><p>Among my activities was membership in the Boy Scouts I rose each year through the ranks, eventually achieving the rank of Eagle Scout and undertaking leadership roles in the organization.</p><p>In fact, the converse is true: At a time when the United States has been called on for a level of moral leadership, vision and inspiration not seen since World War II, we cannot afford to dissemble about crimes against humanity.</p><p>The more I have studied Lincoln, the more I have followed his thought processes, the more I am convinced that he understood leadership better than any other American president.</p><p>Leadership is something I was born with.</p><p>I want to deploy the leadership to meet the challenges that face us and to restore America&#39;s greatness.</p><p>From a parent&#39;s right to know what their children are doing, to protecting citizens across the country from the growing threat of gang violence, the House Democrat leadership is simply out to lunch.</p><p>Instead of starting a new nuclear arms race, now is the time to reclaim our Nation&#39;s position of leadership on nuclear nonproliferation efforts.</p><p>When President Obama was in the Senate, when he was a U.S. senator, he voted against raising the debt ceiling. And he said it was a lack of leadership that had brought us to this point.</p><p>Leadership must be likeable, affable, cordial, and above all emotional. The fashion of authoritarian leadership is gone. Football is about life. You can&#39;t be angry all day.</p><p>Alliances and international organizations should be understood as opportunities for leadership and a means to expand our influence, not as constraints on our power.</p><p>But the ability to articulate what you are doing, to be clear about it, and to stick to it is, I think, the essence of political leadership.</p><p>I never saw myself as an individual who had any particular leadership powers.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what leadership is. You can&#39;t touch it. You can&#39;t feel it. It&#39;s not tangible. But I do know this: you recognize it when you see it.</p><p>We shouldn&#39;t be debating whether to deal with the current code by allowing it to be extended or not. We should have a president who shows leadership and comes to Congress and says: &#39;You know what? We need to reform this whole tax code.&#39;</p><p>This week you will nominate the most experienced executive to seek the presidency in 60 years in Mitt Romney. He has no illusions about what makes America great, and he doesn&#39;t confuse the presidency with celebrity, or loftiness with leadership.</p><p>We have a country to turn around. This week you will nominate the most experienced executive to seek the presidency in 60 years in Mitt Romney. He has no illusions about what makes America great, and he doesn&#39;t confuse the presidency with celebrity, or loftiness with leadership.</p><p>The Leadership Training Institute of America is a cultural think tank providing training and opportunity in leadership development and cultural dynamics.</p><p>The Leadership Training Institute of America trains and equips young men and women to be leaders with high standards of personal morality and integrity.</p><p>On the other hand, the waging of peace as a science, as an art, is in its infancy. But we can trace its growth, its steady progress, and the time will come when there will be particular individuals designated to assume responsibility for and leadership of this movement.</p><p>A significant number of pages and sentences that the administration wants to keep in a classified status have already been released publicly, some of it by public statements of the leadership of the CIA and the FBI.</p><p>In working with UNICEF our corporate partners have demonstrated time and again that their financial resources, leadership and expertise can bring about real and lasting benefits for the world&#39;s children.</p><p>Boone Pickens should be commended for his leadership on American energy security, and for bringing Ted Turner along on some sensible approaches to enhancing it.</p><p>I&#39;ve been the co-chair of the Non-Partisan Women&#39;s Caucus and vice-chair for several years, taking a leadership role in this women&#39;s organization.</p><p>The war and terrorism in the Middle East, the crisis of leadership in many of the oil-supply countries in the developing world, the crisis of global warming - all these are very clearly tied to energy.</p><p>The House Republican leadership has simply run out of ideas.</p><p>Leadership is the key to 99 percent of all successful efforts.</p><p>I want to organize so that women see ourselves as people who are entitled to power, entitled to leadership.</p><p>This administration and the leadership in Congress appear to be intent on valuing wealth over work, thereby placing working families at a distinct disadvantage.</p><p>We should be therefore supporting a larger Europe, and in so doing we should strive to expand the zone of peace and prosperity in the world which is the necessary foundation for a stable international system in which our leadership could be fruitfully exercised.</p><p>Our country also hungers for leadership to ensure the long-term survival of our Social Security system.

I am proud to support him in saying: Yes, we are going to do what is necessary now when it is less painful and less expensive.</p><p>The important thing is that we recognize our President&#39;s leadership, that he is not saying: I am going to walk away from this. He is saying: I am going to do the right thing.</p><p>Well, I think that - I think leadership&#39;s always been about two main things: imagination and courage.</p><p>I definitely wasn&#39;t cool in high school. I really wasn&#39;t. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas. But I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things.</p><p>People more than ever since I can remember are concerned about being out of step and out of line with their political party and won&#39;t cross over.

People are fearful of their leadership as well.</p><p>Different times need different types of leadership.</p><p>Preparing our city to achieve its destiny will require strong leadership.</p><p>It&#39;s a different era.

So criticism from him I kind of wear as a badge of honor.</p><p>The conduct of President Bush&#39;s war of choice has been plagued with incompetent civilian leadership decisions that have cost many lives and rendered the war on and occupation of Iraq a strategic policy disaster for the United States.</p><p>For many members of Congress, the time for choosing is near - do what the party leadership demands, or do what the people have asked you to do. If my colleagues don&#39;t mind some advice from a newcomer, I&#39;d suggest going with the will of the people.</p><p>This is one of the major problems we have.

Now we&#39;ve put programs in place not to have that happen, but that could be a weakness.</p><p>I think national issues play into gubernatorial races less than, obviously, in Senate and Congressional races.
