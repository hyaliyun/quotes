dna is constantly under assault from chemical reactions taking place in our bodies and from things were exposed to in our everyday livesmost of the time dna damage is repaired successfully by the cell but if the cell continues to grow whilst its dna is already damaged it can lead to cancer boulton is learning about dna damage repair by first studying it inside a microscopic worm called c elegans and then extending these findings to human cells an approach that has revealed remarkable similarities between the genes and proteins used to repair dna damage in the worm and in humansby studying this fundamental process of dna damage repair the researchers have contributed to our understanding of how faults in the system can lead to cancerboulton himself has explained his work at the dna damage response laboratory as follows dna is a highly reactive molecule that is susceptible to damage fortunately cells have evolved specialised repair processes that are remarkably efficient in correcting specific types of dna damage failure to correctly repair dna damage will lead to mutagenic change which can contribute to ageing and cancer indeed defects in genes that repair dna damage are the underlying cause of a number of hereditary ageingcancer predisposition syndromes such as fanconi anemia and blooms the focus of my lab is to identify new dna repair genes understand how they work in dna repair in mitotic and meiotic cells and determine how defects in these processes contribute to human disease such as cancer we hope that our work will provide an improved understanding of how dna repair works and how when dna repair is compromised it contributes to cancerageing and or infertility disorders in humans boultons research has resulted in several major breakthroughs in understanding that are viewed as highly promising with regard to the potential development of new cancer treatments"},{"author":"Mihalj Keri","quote":"mihalj keri serbian cyrillic mxa kep born 15

papetti met the writer and biographer james lord who wrote a significant critical essay on his work james lord wrote the following about papetti the first and perhaps the most illuminating thing to be

to do so than others one thinks of van gogh but not papetti it is not his subject matter that evokes the homeland in this he is truly international and entirely his own era despite seeming reminiscences of styles of the past these are resemblances only what is italian about papetti is his masterly selfeffacement in confrontation with the subject matter as a person he never gets in the way of what the artist is doing the art is there and he is the innocent perpetrator of what his hand instructs him to do he sees to be sure what he is doing but when he is working none of what he sees

australian art paving the way for later notable artists such as juan davila and howard arkley his work is represented by the national gallery of australia the national gallery of victoria the art gallery of new south wales the metropolitan museum of art new york and the mertz collection his paintings are eclectic studded with allusions both historical cultural and personal there is something almost diaristic about his work but its presentation is anything but linear and logical abiding themes are mortality ageing sexual identity popular and youth culture and cinema there is also a strong element of humour iconoclasm and irony in his work from their titles such as art cant fart for rose selavay four wise men looking for god in abstract art dr fu manchus death by gyro or ship of fools hello sailor to comic and grotesque figurative elements and their sometimes lurid but highly resolved colour schemes on a technical level his paintings combine oils enamels both sprayed and applied with brush and collaged elements from personal photographs to objects stuck on or painted over stylistically sansom uses a wide array of painting techniques but signature devices include allowing earlier layers of paint to remain visible hardedge geometric shapes juxtaposed with playful lyrical more organic or atmospheric passages of paint and figurative doodles often at the margins of the paintings"},{"author":"Jamie Clarke (footballer, born 1988)","quote":"andre nathan jermaine everton clarke born 11 september 1988 in hammersmith is an unattached english footballer having left lincoln
