primarily a painter producing colorful works on paper that mix media and techniques including gouache acrylic painting and drawing each of the paintings being shown here is well crafted and

descendant as the dominant promotion in memphis the continental wrestling association as a wrestling announcer he is best known for a relaxed announcing style which relied upon sharply or dramatically worded statements during heated moments as opposed to the screaming and shouting preferred by other wrestling announcers and for his twodecadeplus onair association with dave brown a college student and disc jockey when the two first teamed in 1967 and later a top weather forecaster on memphis television for decades in addition russell enjoyed a long career in the television industry in west tennessee at stations wdxi jackson whbq and wmc memphis mostly as a programming executiverussell was in a very real sense the central figure of championship wrestling for several decades however while russell definitely became a star of sorts due to the job he never found himself in the position of being a bigger star than the wrestlers he worked with unlike other wrestling announcers who were based in midsized and smaller markets such as danny williams and ed whalen this is in no small part due to the strong talent pool he worked with over the years such as lou thesz jackie fargo jerry lawler and jimmy hartrussells banter with lawler bill dundee and dutch mantel extended many years and covered these individuals frequent turns between heel and babyface russell would get up from his chair to conduct interviews walking around to the front of the desk standing shouldertoshoulder with the wrestlers and using exaggerated facial expressions during the conversation these interviews were often the highlight of the saturday morning television broadcasttaping russell also literally rang a bell to begin matches in addition to pounding it loudly in futile attempts to halt outofcontrol melees in the ringrussell was nicknamed banana nose by many of memphis heel wrestlers over the years starting with lawler like with ric flair in the midatlantic territory during the late 1970s and early 1980s the size and shape of his nose became a frequent conversation point for heels during promos russell was able to enjoy a strong run from the late 1970s to the mid1980s working with hart who was in the unique position of being the promotions top heel in spite of not actually being a wrestler hart recorded the song lance russells nose in 1983russell also used the mike to chastise and exhort wrestlers as matches occurred particularly brutal attacks elicited dismay and disgust from russell he often encouraged other wrestlers to run in from the locker room and offer assistance an episode from 1981 found russell being attacked by the dream machine after airing a less than flattering music video of him in a 1985 episode russell had a bag of flour dumped on him by jimmy hart which led to hart being suspended another angle from 1988 where curt hennig attacked a memphis businessman who had shown his support for lawler who at the time had just won the awa world championship from hennig saw russell physically inserted into the action mainly in attempting to separate the two other physical attacks and angry verbal confrontations remain either well viewed or rememberedrussell has also even to this day been humorously identified with baxter suits this originally stemmed from a ca 1977 promo with the heel lawler which became more widely known when it was included in a 1980s vhs compilation of classic memphis wrestling and later disseminated more widely from there via the internet in the promo lawler explained to brown that russells absence from the program that day was due to a death in the family his baxter suit died it shined itself to death did you know thatin addition he has been known for various oneliners such as dont start with that smart stuff what in the sam hill is that and will you guys just stop and get out of here usually delivered in the course of trying to restore order in the tv studio following an angle or meleerussell and brown switched together from whbq to wmc in 1977 at lawlers urging shortly after jerry jarrett split with nick gulas and the midamerica promotion and began producing a wrestling program on wmc after russell left memphis for world championship wrestling in 1989 brown continued as the host of the wrestling program frequently teamed with corey maclin and demonstrating a style similar to russellrussell was also the ring announcer and playbyplay announcer for monday night matches at the midsouth coliseum the 90 minute live program in memphis was edited for syndication to the rest of the territory such as nashville louisville lexington and evansville russell would also tour the circuit occasionally over the years and cut promos at house shows for those markets however jackson and tupelo are within the viewing area of memphis television stations so an hourlong program of arena matches was produced to air in those markets in order to maintain kayfabe and still promote house shows in those areasrussell also liveannounced taped house show matches from tupelo during the late 1970s during an era when taping house shows outside of the home arena was unheard of in many wrestling promotions this had the historic consequence of allowing the original tupelo concession stand brawl in 1978 to be preserved on tape as well as other unique moments such as a tugofwar between jos leduc and numerous members of the audience the videos offer strong evidence of russells work with live playbyplay as well as his versatility in various announcing roles and situations the tape of the concession stand brawl shows russell signing off from the broadcast as the wrestlers move away from the ring followed by the sound of russells voice on a dark screen as he hurriedly instructs the cameraman to turn his camera back on and turn it around in the crows nest position they were taping from located directly above the concession standoutside of numerous clips found on youtube and
