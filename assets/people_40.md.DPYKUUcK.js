scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposes its flaws as a result he has acquired a reputation for frequently changing his own position putnam is currently cogan university professor emeritus at harvard universityin philosophy of mind putnam is known for his argument against the typeidentity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental and for the concept of functionalism an influential theory regarding the mindbody problem in philosophy of language along with saul kripke and others he developed the causal theory of reference and formulated an original theory of meaning inventing the notion of semantic externalism based on a famous thought experiment called twin earthin philosophy of mathematics he and his mentor w v quine developed the quineputnam indispensability thesis an argument for the reality of mathematical entities later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical but quasiempirical in the field of epistemology he is known for his critique of the well known brain in a vat thought experiment this thought experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism but putnam challenges its coherencein metaphysics he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics first adopting a view he called internal realism which he later abandoned despite these changes of view throughout his career he remained committed to scientific realism roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things arein the philosophy of perception putnam accepts direct realism according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world in the past he further held that there are no mental representations sense data or other intermediaries that stand between the mind and the world by 2012 however he rejected this further commitment in favor of transactionalism a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are worldinvolving transactions and that these transactions are functionally describable provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function such transactions can further involve qualiain his

in philosophy at princeton where she studied with george pitcher kitchers interest in cognition manifested early and has continued to shape and inform her work throughout her career her doctoral dissertation defended a psychological continuity criterion for personal identity but extended the scope of the psychological criterion beyond that traditionally posited to include broader and more abstract cognitive characteristics such as cognitive approach or cognitive style since then her work has ranged widely from traditional philosophy of psychology to sigmund freud and ultimately to her greatest philosophical passion kant scholarshipin her early work kitcher wrote a number of papers in philosophy of psychology philosophy of mind and philosophy of science she argued for the viability of intentional psychology and the autonomy of functionalist psychology from neurophysiology later work predominantly concentrated on analysis of problems stemming from the interpretation of kants first critique kitcher has written numerous articles on the forms of intuition kants epistemology selfconsciousness and on how transcendental arguments workkitcher has written two books that also pursue psychological themes kants transcendental psychology was a radical departure from most kant exegesis the book makes two main claims about the critique of pure reason first contra peter frederick strawson kitcher argues that to understand synthetic a priori knowledge it is essential to consider transcendental psychology second she explicates a kantian argument for the necessity of an integrated thinking subject which serves as a reply to david humes denial of the unity of the self an expanded and amended version of this position is being fleshed out more fully in her most recent book kants thinker which also explores the question of how we are to understand the faculties and how the critique contributes to debates about conscious and unconscious ideasin freuds dream kitcher argued that freud was the first cognitive scientist psychoanalysis should be thought of as an exercise in interdisciplinary theory construction and as such it illuminates the pitfalls to which such interdisciplinary approaches are subject kitcher jokes that her arguments managed to alienate all readers freudians because she exposes the mistaken foundation of psychoanalysis and antifreudians because she portrays his program as scientifically legitimatearound the turn of the new century kitchers interests turned toward kantian ethics her works from this period provide an account of kantian maxims and an interpretation of kants argument for the formulation of the universal law for the categorical imperative a task that has led many other kant experts to throw up their hands in perplexitykitchers prodigious published contributions to philosophy are matched by her contributions to the philosophical community she has served as department chair in three different universities on numerous academic committees including being a founding chair of the uc committee on the status of women as president of the society for philosophy and psychology as president of the north american

engineering at the university of toronto 1946 1951after earning degrees in chemical engineering james joined colin mclaurin an air force veteran and aeronautical engineer and fred hampton a leader in the field of prosthetics at sunnybrooke veterans hospital in toronto in 1951 working for the department of veterans affairs with the culmination of wwii veterans across the world were complaining about the quality of their artificial limbs as stated by douglas a hobson in his article reflections on rehabilitation engineering history are there lessons to be learned there was clearly a coalescence of national need and emotions he writes regarding the returning wwii veterans this need translated into a political will and funded programs within leading federal agencies in both canada and the us at the sunnybrooke hospital in toronto james helped to develop a prosthetic foot that unlike any previous models had no moving parts and essentially functioned like a rocker as well due to complaints from fisherman he replaced the raw hide used to protect the prosthesis with a plastic material that was more suited to withstand various elements such as moisturein 1953 with what he had learned at sunnybrook hospital opportunity drew james to the university of californiaberkeley where working with cw radcliff he helped to develop the quadrilateral socket by developing a jig fitting system for amputations above the knee unlike previous technology these jigs held the correct position of the residual limb therefore making fitting of the socket for the residual limb easier and more comfortable for amputees to walk as kevin carroll james c baird and katherine binder relate in their book prosthetics and patient management a comprehensive clinical approach the work that james foort did at berkeley and subsequently with the exploration of the biomechanics of alignment during ambulation remains the basis of contemporary prosthetic alignment in addition to developing the quadrilateral socket the team at berkeley systematized the prosthesis developed by colin maclaurin and fred hampton for total absence of the limb the berkeley team developed the ptb below knee prosthesis for amputations below the knee completely new technologies the ptb prosthesis enabled the amputee to walk around with no corset or side joints not only did these new adaptations solve the problem of constriction of circulation and ease restriction on the thigh but it allowed people to be amputated below the knee twice as was usual for amputations related to circulatory problems thereby increasing their functionjames returned to canada in 1963 where living and working in winnipeg he developed a modular system of lower extremity prosthetics this tinker toy system as he describes it meant that instead of long delays in the process of making adjusting and replacing prosthetics it could now be done extremely quickly because each of the parts could fit easily into one another everything had to be sculpted beforein 1971 james moved to vancouver where with a team of engineers he developed a computer program to fit artificial limbs the program provided a means of making the shape of the socket which would then be used to program the machine that carved the shape his modular tinker toy system would then be used to put the prosthesis together the computer system would later be known as cadcam computer aided design and manufacture dudley s childress highlights in his computer aided design and manufacture presentation that historically the development of cadcam stems from the initial conception and engineering work by james foort in the 1960s and 1970s cadcam was developed and later improved by prosthetics companies such as biosculptor looking to make profit james foort never attempted to patent any of his technological breakthroughs in pursuit of profit choosing instead to make the technology affordable and easily accessible in the age of the relentless pursuit of profit james can be viewed as something of a modern day hero for his willingness to devote his life to helping others without wanting anything in returnjames foort retired in december 1986

what to put in and what to take out and when and by his ability to convey moods and times of day in his stories as a kid i could just feel myself outside when i was reading them being by myself when the stillness of the afternoon is spookier than the dark of the night you know he would draw lone silhouettes off in the distance and they seemed so lonely it made me want to cry weve been trying to write stories like that ever since trying to convey those feelings that he put into those storiesbolling received the inkpot award in 2005 in recognition of his work on little archie"},{"author":"Skip

academic study and was generally neglected with the exception of some major contributions by authors such as ernest gellner benedict anderson and anthony d smith connors work is another exception to this rule and today he is regarded as one of the scholars of nationalism and ethnic conflict who has contributed most towards establishing a conceptual grounding for the study of nationalismwidely cited for his insistence on the inherently ethnic character of nationalism which he calls ethnonationalism to emphasize the point connor has long held that the most significant obstacle to advancing the study of nationalism is terminological imprecision particularly problematic he contends is the tendency to conflate the distinct concepts of state and nation as well as the respective concepts of patriotism and nationalism which derive from themanother significant theme in connors work is the passionate nonrational character of nationalism when trying to understand national sentiment he argues the key is not chronological or factual history but sentient or felt history national identity is based on the emotional psychology of perceived kinship ties a sense of the nation as the fully extended family and accordingly belongs to the realm of the subconscious and nonrationalfinally connor is also well known for his analysis of marxistleninist treatments of nationalism which he deals

documentation held by inter alia former foreign minister johan jrgen holst has been refused access to waage and others speculate that such documentation has been kept hidden for partypolitical reasons

role of a very modest facilitator however during the second from may 1993 after the israelis upgraded the status of the oslo talksnorway was also an active mediator but its mediation role did not involve being on equal terms with each of the involved parties no evidence has been found showing or even suggesting that the norwegians argued in the same way towards the israelis as they did towards the palestinians there appears to have been a striking lack of evenhandedness on the part of the norwegians in terms of attempts to persuade the israeli actors to see the palestinian point of view or revealing to the plo where the palestinians might have had their best negotiating chances the result achieved in 1993 the oslo agreement was not an ordinary peace agreement in essence it was more of a timetable a point of departure with many vaguely formulated intentions plo leader arafats willingness to accept the oslo accord with all its shortcomings and compromises was clearly a result of his

ten years in the hotel business and twelve years in the oil and chemical plant industry he was elected mayor of riverton manitoba in october 1989 and held the position until his election to the provincial legislature the following yearevans was elected as a new democrat in the provincial election of 1990 defeating progressive conservative candidate ed trachuk in the midnorthern riding of interlake by about 400 votes the election was won by the progressive conservatives and evans sat in the official oppositionthe progressive conservatives again nominated trachuk against evans for the provincial election of 1995 but of greater longterm significance was the candidacy of darryl sutherland from independent native voice a group which purported to represent aboriginal interests in the region a government inquiry would subsequently establish that sutherlands candidacy had been encouraged financed and organized by leading figures in the ridings progressive conservative network in the hopes that sutherland would take enough votes away from the ndp to allow a pc victory the aboriginal communities of northern manitoba have generally supported the ndp at least since the early 1970sas it happened this attempted votesplitting was unsuccessful and evans was reelected by a greater margin than before sutherlands 289 votes were not enough to make a difference in the outcome and most of the ridings aboriginal voters supported evans who had in fact been publicly endorsed by the chiefs of the eight interlake first nationsevans had heard rumours about sutherlands candidacy during the campaign in fact some suspicions were raised in the winnipeg free press shortly before election day he did not raise the issue himself during the campaign although former ndp cabinet minister bill uruski and other figures within the party conducted some investigations on the matterin early 1998 evans and fellow ndp mla tim sale received information that leading pc organizer taras sokolyk had played a role in encouraging inv candidates in the previous election according to doug smiths as many liars a literary overview of the scandal evans was able to confirm this information through a discussion with allan aitken a pc organizer in the region who had previously been among evanss personal friends under pressure from the ndp caucus and some elements of the media premier gary filmon called a public inquiry into the scandal which found that sutherlands candidacy had been encouraged by progressive conservative interests with the intention of causing votesplittingironically evanss own career was damaged by the scandal inquiry the pcs raised concerns about connections between evans and sale and the canadian broadcasting corporation which had publicized the story in early 1998 the government also attempted to show inconsistencies in evanss statements to the legislature on the subject as to whether or not he believed there were two tory campaigns in the riding these allegations were not particularly serious but the attacks on his credibility seem to have played a role in evanss decision not to seek reelection in 1999 he has not reentered public life since this

published his first collection of poetry the deed of gift in 1998 the collection represents all of murphys work as a poet through about 1996 in a contemporary review of the volume gerry cambridge summarized murphys accomplishment there are outstanding poems here including harvest of sorrows sunset at the getty and the quarrel as well as a great number of very likeable individual and tautlymade pieces it would be hard to confuse murphy with any other contemporary poet no one else writing poetry in english sounds quite like him as poet dick davis has noted this distinctive style owes much to murphys use of traditional meter and rhyme unusual among poets today his poems are wholly his own and yet the voice in them lives in and through his mastery of traditional metre which is so thorough as to seem indivisible from the poems sensibility and meaning this focus on rhyme and meter is exemplified in the following excerpt from harvest of sorrowswhen swift brown swallowsreturn to their

valiantly fought for his rights until recently with his employers southern railway after being denied a due promotion that his prolonged battle with railways didnt have a happy ending is another matter fighting well is the credo of sportsmen and deva has given his all in his bouts against his opponents and employersboxing is a family sport for deva inspired by his father venkatesans unflinching support deva scaled heights few indian boxers had before vijender singh his brothers harikrishnan and baskaran also achieved prominence in boxing when deva won a bronze medal in the featherweight category at the 1994 world cup in bangkok what struck many was his babyface it was radically different from the face of a boxer it had a rare innocence deva was only 20 years old that time but he had maturity beyond his age upon his arrival in new delhi from bangkok deva spoke like a real champion i was eager to perform there was no point in saying that i too took part in the world championship the olympics and the world cup without having done anything worth remembering he had said a win over thailands kamsing somluck in front of a baying home crowd was the highlight of devas

mongolian lkhagva dugarbaaatar went on to become a professional champion in 1999 only an unfortunate firstround pairing with a cuban champion spoiled his olympic hopes in barcelona 1992 deva had chances to qualify for the next olympics but his heart was after professional boxing at that time sports administrators keep a distance from the stars of their disciplines in this country but the late iabf president aspy adajania made his liking for deva public adajania always held the boxer in high esteem he even had deva as his personal guest in bombay after the chenna stars bangkok successdevas heart beats for sports in general and boxing in particular when a newspaper published an article a couple of years ago that the tamil nadu government had been delaying cash incentives for state sports achievers the olympian was the first to react he poured his heart out against the inordinate delay a help in need is a help indeed he had said at that time from his personal experience deva knew the importance of timely help that is why he was ready to stick his neck out and seek immediate government action when the tn government moved to right the wrong the olympian was overjoyed he felt so happy as if he was one among the beneficiaries deva hasnt forgotten the odds he had overcome to become a worldclass pugilisttaking boxing away from devas system will mean sucking the life out of the man the plight of young boxers continues to strike a chord with him rain or shine deva is out there at the nehru stadium every evening to train youngsters who would otherwise be struggling to learn the lessons of boxing the bighearted arjuna awardee doesnt charge a penny from his charges he knows well that boxing is a workingclass sport more importantly deva is not out there to make money his

a bee all those who have watched venkatesan devarajan in national and international level competitions will unanimously say no hard punching has never been devarajans cup of tea who wants it anyway as the computer scoring has revolutionized the amateur boxing on such a scale knock out punchers are no longer needed to win b outs these daysthe unassuming lanky boy from a middleclass family has been a phenomenal success in indian amateur boxing history from a club level pugilist he has risen to the level of qualifying for the olympics and winning the world cup bronze medal at bangkok at 1994it is not that he has been the first boxer from tamil nadu to bring glory to the country the state has been in the vanguard of producing out standing men with ring craft from the british dayseven if one ignores the professional part of the state boxing which has more shady side out of it there has been a strong tradition from this piece of land olympian munusamy venu amalraj xavier and many more on the asian level have taken this country to greater glory from the 70s of course most of them went through the services however devarajans route to the success has been different he did not have to be the services pugilist to achieve laurels in a short span of five years even in the early days of his boxing career he had class he held the attention of the spectators with his beautiful foot work but his punching was eratile he was hurling more wild ones of course he was physically not strong because of his pencil thin body later it was the railway coach devan who had to put him through weight training to strengthen his arms for punchesbefore joining the railways he gave tamil nadu its first gold medal in the national champion ship in 40years since then he has been winning the gold medal at national champion ships almost every time his career took an upswing from 1991 onwards he was the lone boxer to win the gold medal in asian qualifying round for the barcelona olympic he was one of the five indian pugilists who qualified for the games in 1992 he was so good during his training in cuba and at the asian level competitions that the then iabf president late aspy adajanin expected that if at all there was a medal for india in the olympics in boxing it could be from devarajan he aired this view to media alsounfortunately devarajan ran into a cuban in the very first round and last round points but two years later he had a commanders success in the world cup he faced tougher opponents coach devan attributes this success to the cuban blas fermandezs who did wonders for devarajan in his three years coaching stint what ever my be the cubans qualities he has made devarajan a very sharp puncher cutting down all his erratic swing set the railway coach may be this is the reason for his phenomenal successwhen he won the world cup bronze medal in feather weight adajania who was so elated took him to bombay as his personal guest for a couple days devarajan gets emotional even today for it had been an unforgettable experience for himdevarajan has certainly showed the indian pugilist that world level medals are not beyond their reach this itself is a great achievement for this
