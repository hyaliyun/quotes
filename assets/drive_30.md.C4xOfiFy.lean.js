A growing mind attracts elements and forces that help to promote growth, and people who are determined to make more and more of themselves, are drawn more and more into circumstances through which they will find the opportunity to make more of themselves. And this law works not only in connection with the external world, but also the internal world. When you begin to make a positive determined use of those powers in yourself that are already in positive action, you draw forth into action powers within you that have been dormant, and as this process continues, you will find that you will accumulate volume, capacity and power in your mental world, until you finally become a mental giant.","author":"Christian D.

The very structure of trauma, including activation, dissociation and freezing are based on the evolution of survival behaviors. When threatened or injured, all animals draw from a \\"library\\" of possible responses. We orient, dodge, duck, stiffen, brace, retract, fight, flee, freeze, collapse, etc. All of these coordinated responses are somatically based- they are things that the body does to protect and defend itself. It is when these orienting and defending responses are overwhelmed that we see trauma.The bodies of traumatized people portray \\"snapshots\\" of their unsuccessful attempts to defend themselves in the face of threat and injury. Trauma is a highly activated incomplete biological response to threat, frozen in time. For example, when we prepare to fight or to flee, muscles throughout our entire body are tensed in specific patterns of high energy readiness. When we are unable to complete the appropriate actions, we fail to discharge the tremendous energy generated by our survival preparations. This energy becomes fixed in specific patterns of neuromuscular readiness. The person then stays in a state of acute and then chronic arousal and dysfunction in the central nervous system. Traumatized people are not suffering from a disease in the normal sense of the word- they have become stuck in an aroused state. It is difficult if not impossible to function normally under these circumstances.","author":"Peter A.

There is a form of implicit memory that is profoundly unconscious and forms the basis for the imprint trauma leaves on the body/mind. The type of memory utilized in learning most physical activities (walking, riding a bike, skiing, etc.) is a form of implicit memory called procedural memory. Procedural or \\"body memories\\" are learned sequences of coordinated \\"motor acts\\" chained together into meaningful actions. You may not remember explicitly how and when you learned them, but, at the appropriate moment, they are (implicitly) \\"recalled\\" and mobilized (acted out) simultaneously. These memories (action patterns) are formed and orchestrated largely by involuntary structures in the cerebellum and basal ganglia.When a person is exposed to overwhelming stress, threat or injury, they develop a procedural memory. Trauma occurs when these implicit procedures are not neutralized. The failure to restore homeostasis is at the basis for the maladaptive and debilitating symptoms of trauma.","author":"Peter A.

To avoid the mistake that White finds in the hypothesis of nonintentional bias, teleology would have to be restrictive in what it makes likely, but without depending on intentions or motives. This would probably have to involve some conception of an increase in value through the expanded possibilities provided by the higher forms of organization toward which nature tends: not just any outcome could qualify as a telos.

Allow it to be in balance. Avoid extremes: the middle way is better. Neither force the mind too hard into concentration nor let it wander aimlessly. Meditation is to pay attention, to be aware of your breathing, your posture, your feelings, your perceptions, your thoughts, and all that passes through your mind and the mind itself; whatever is going on within you and between you and the universe. Meditation is not just sitting for an hour here or an hour there; meditation is a way of life. It is practiced all the time. There is no separation between meditation and everyday living.

There was no way out once he was in, no genuine rest, no one to talk to who was capable of understanding the complexity (simplicity) of the problem or the approaches to a tentative solution. There came a time in every prolonged effort when he had a moment of near panic, or \\"terror in a lonely place,\\" the original semantic content of the word. The lonely place was his own mind. As a mathematician he was free from subjection to reality, free to impose his ideas and designs on his own test environment. The only valid standard for his work, its critical point (zero or infinity), was the beauty it possessed, the deft strength of his mathematical reasoning. THe work's ultimate value was simply what it revealed about the nature of his intellect. What was at stake, in effect, was his own principle of intelligence or individual consciousness; his identity, in short. This was the infalling trap, the source of art's private involvement with obsession and despair, neither more nor less than the artist's self-containment, a mental state that led to storms of overwork and extended stretches of depression, that brought on indifference to life and at times the need to regurgitate it, to seek the level of expelled matter. Of course, the sense at the end of a serious effort, if the end is reached successfully, is one of lyrical exhilaration. There is air to breathe and a place to stand. The work gradually reveals its attachment to the charged particles of other minds, men now historical, the rediscovered dead; to the main structure of mathematical thought; perhaps even to reality itself, the so-called sum of things. It is possible to stand in time's pinewood dust and admire one's own veronicas and pavanes.","author":"Don DeLillo, Ratner's Star","category":"art, art-creation, concentration, depression, despair, loneliness, mental-health, mind, obsession, thought"},{"quote":"In his article, Bogen concluded: I believe [with Wigan] that each of us has two minds in one person.

From its ether of manifestation that is garlanded in perpetual darkness, it not only influences and seeks the ruination and destruction of everything that resides in our universe, but rushes to embrace its own oblivion as well.To accomplish this, however, it must hide within the shroud of lies and deceit it spins to manipulate the weak-minded as well as those who choose to ally themselves with it for their own personal gain. For evil must rely on the self-serving interests of the arrogant, the lustful, the power-hungry, the hateful, and the greedy to feed and proliferate. This then becomes the condition of evils existence: the baneful ideologies of those who wantonly chose to ignore the needs and rights of others, inducing oppression, fear, pain, and even death throughout the cosmos. And by these means, evil seeks to supplant the balance of the universe with its perverse nature. And once all that was good has been extinguished by corruption or annihilation, evil will then turn upon and consume what remains: particularly its immoral servants who have assisted its purpose so well  along with itself. And within that terrible instant of unimaginable exploding quantum fury, it will burn brighter than a trillion galaxies to herald its moment of ultimate triumph. But a moment is all that it shall be.

Thus defined, religion consists of two elements, a theoretical and a practical, namely, a belief in powers higher than man and an attempt to propitiate or please them. Of the two, belief clearly comes first, since we must believe in the existence of a divine being before we can attempt to please him. But unless the belief leads to a corresponding practice, it is not a religion but merely a theology; in the language of St. James, faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. In other words, no man is religious who does not govern his conduct in some measure by the fear or love of God. On the other hand, mere practice, divested of all religious belief, is also not religion. Two men may behave in exactly the same way, and yet one of them may be religious and the other not.

The functionary becomes a mixture of Zimbardo's prison guards and the experimenter himself, under siege from without while at the same time following an inflexible rubric set down by those higher up the hierarchical chain, people whose job description makes them responsible, but who in turn see themselves as serving the general public as a non-specific entity and believe or have been told that only strict adherence to a system can produce impartial fairness. Fairness is supposed to be vested in the code: no human can or should make the system fairer by exercising judgement. In other words, the whole thing creates a collective responsibility culminating in a blameless loop. Everyone assumes that it's not their place to take direct personal responsibility for what happens; that level of vested individual power is part of the previous almost feudal version of responsibility. The deindividuation is actually to a certain extent the desired outcome, though its negative consequences are not.","author":"Nick Harkaway, The Blind Giant","category":"authority, bureaucracy, government, individual, life, power, responsibility, systems"},{"quote":"Because our power is motivating, and gives momentum and ownership of changes to those who dream of failure.","author":"Lisa McMann","category":"fade, momentum, motivating, power, strength, wake-series"},{"quote":"Like casinos, large corporate entities have studied the numbers and the ways in which people respond to them. These are not con tricks - they're not even necessarily against our direct interests, although sometimes they can be - but they are hacks for the human mind, ways of manipulating us into particular decisions we otherwise might not make. They are also, in a way, deliberate underminings of the core principle of the free market, which derives its legitimacy from the idea that informed self-interest on aggregate sets appropriate prices for items. The key word is 'informed'; the point of behavioural economics - or rather, of its somewhat buccaneering corporate applications - is to skew our perception of the purchase to the advantage of the company. The overall consequence of that is to tilt the construction of our society away from what it should be if we were making the rational decisions classical economics imagines we would, and towards something else.","author":"Nick Harkaway, The Blind Giant","category":"capitalism, choice, corporations, economics, information, power, society, systems"},{"quote":"There is a lure in power.

It was the question I hadnt yet dared voice.He wont be tricked again so easily, he said, staring up at the ceiling. Her biggest weapon is that she keeps our powers contained. But she cant access them, not whollythough she can control us through them. Its why Ive never been able to shatter her mindwhy shes not dead already. The moment you break Amaranthas curse, Tamlins wrath will be so great that no force in the world will keep him from splattering her on the walls.A chill went through me.Why do you think Im doing this? He waved a hand to me.Because youre a monster.He laughed. True, but Im also a pragmatist. Working Tamlin into a senseless fury is the best weapon we have against her. Seeing you enter into a fools bargain with Amarantha was one thing, but when Tamlin saw my tattoo on your arm  Oh, you should have been born with my abilities, if only to have felt the rage that seeped from him.I didnt want to think much about his abilities. Whos to say he wont splatter you as well?Perhaps hell trybut I have a feeling hell kill Amarantha first. Thats what it all boils down to, anyway: even your servitude to me can be blamed on her. So hell kill her tomorrow, and Ill be free before he can start a fight with me that will reduce our once-sacred mountain to rubble. He picked at his nails. And I have a few other cards to play.I lifted my brows in silent question.Feyre, for Cauldrons sake. I drug you, but you dont wonder why I never touch you beyond your waist or arms?Until tonightuntil that damned kiss. I gritted my teeth, but even as my anger rose, a picture cleared.Its the only claim I have to innocence, he said, the only thing that will make Tamlin think twice before entering into a battle with me that would cause a catastrophic loss of innocent life. Its the only way I can convince him I was on your side. Believe me, I would have liked nothing more than to enjoy youbut there are bigger things at stake than taking a human woman to my bed.I knew, but I still asked, Like what?Like my territory, he said, and his eyes held a far-off look that I hadnt yet seen. Like my remaining people, enslaved to a tyrant queen who can end their lives with a single word. Surely Tamlin expressed similar sentiments to you. He hadntnot entirely. He hadnt been able to, thanks to the curse.Why did Amarantha target you? I dared ask. Why make you her whore?Beyond the obvious? He gestured to his perfect face. When I didnt smile, he loosed a breath. My father killed Tamlins fatherand his brothers.I started. Tamlin had never saidnever told me the Night Court was responsible for that.Its a long story, and I dont feel like getting into it, but lets just say that when she stole our lands out from under us, Amarantha decided that she especially wanted to punish the son of her friends murdererdecided that she hated me enough for my fathers deeds that I was to suffer.I might have reached a hand toward him, might have offered my apologiesbut every thought had dried up in my head.

Rather than seizing, hoarding, and exercising power in the domineering ways of typical kings, conquistadors, and religious leaders, Jesus was consistently empowering others.

His longing not to do evil himself blinded him to the need to ward off the evil of others. This painfully knotted man hoped with one swipe of his moral sword to rid himself of the impossible tangle and to be clear and simple for once in his life. But being Oppenheimer could never be as easy as that.For Oppenheimer embodied two of the highest human types, the theoretical man described by Aristotle as god-like for living in the mind, among changeless truths, and the paragon of Machiavellian virtue, god-like in commanding the power of life and death over other men. No theoretical man before Oppenheimer had known such lordly power. In certain high moments he approached that Aristotelian theoretical purity which lives for the joys of knowing the world, whatever it might prove to be; in another light he thrilled at that Machiavellian power and its attendant renown; in contrary moods he reviled himself for the suffering he brought into the world, and ached to renounce his distinction and to be merely another man among men. Perhaps no theoretical man can be equal to such a burden: to feel knowledge as power when ones mind reshapes the world irrevocably, to see the light of truth as the agent of some dark majesty, is not grace but ordeal.

To this end, he marshals an impressive array of arguments, from the most blatant denial to the most sophisticated and elegant rationalization. After every atrocity one can expect to hear the same predictable apologies: it never happened; the victim lies; the victim exaggerates; the victim brought it upon herself; and in any case it is time to forget the past and move on.

In Travancore it rose out of the Buddhist idea of compassion, in Yingzhou from the Hodenosaunee idea of the equality of all, in Firanja from the idea of justice before God. Everywhere the idea existed, but the world still belonged to a tiny minority of rich; wealth had been accumulating for centuries in a few hands, and the people lucky enough to be born into this old aristocracy lived in the old manner, with the rights of kings now spread among the wealthy of the Earth. Money had replaced land as the basis of power, and money flowed according to its own gravity, its laws of accumulation, which though divorced from nature, were nevertheless the laws ruling most countries on Earth, no matter their religious or philosophical ideas of love, compassion, charity, equality, goodness, and the like. Old Zhu had been right: humanity's behavior was still based on old laws, which determined how food and land and water and surplus wealth around, how the labor of the eight billions was owned. If these laws did not change, the living shell of the earth might well be wrecked, and inherited by seagulls and ants and cockroaches.","author":"Kim Stanley Robinson, The Years of Rice and Salt","category":"egalitarianism, equality, greed, power, wealth"},{"quote":"We may not have the power to change, but we have the power to move.","author":"Lik Hock Yap Ivan","category":"change, inspiration, motivation, move, positivity, power"},{"quote":"Sometimes, power could change hands as quickly as a knife thrust.","author":"Conn Iggulden, Khan: Empire of Silver","category":"change, hands, knife, power, thrust"},{"quote":"Every spoken sentence beginning with I Am is a powerful spell exhaled into action.

I can say that this was an incapacity linked undoubtedly with the political situation in which we found ourselves. It is hard to see where, either on the Right or the Left, this problem of power could then have been posed. On the Right, it was posed only in terms of constitution, sovereignty, and so on, that is, in juridical terms; on the Marxist side, it was posed only in terms of the state apparatus. The way power was exercised - concretely, and in detail - with its specificity, its techniques and tactics, was something no one attempted to ascertain; they contented themselves with denouncing it in a polemical and global fashion as it existed among the \\"other,\\" in the adversary camp. Where Soviet socialist power was in question, its opponents called it totalitarianism; power in Western capitalism was denounced by the Marxists as class domination; but the mechanics of power in themselves were never analyzed.","author":"Michel Foucault, Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977","category":"power"},{"quote":"Power is a game, and in games you do not judge your opponents by their intentions but by the effects of their actions.","author":"Robert Greene, The 48 Laws of Power","category":"game, power"},{"quote":"You have goodness in your heart, but your darkness overwhelms it all; your desire to hurt, destroy, and avenge is more powerful than your desire to love, help, and light the way.","author":"Marie Lu, The Young Elites","category":"adelina-amouteru, darkness, goodness, love, power"},{"quote":"There is no greater power and support you can give someone than to look them in the eye, and with sincerity/conviction say, 'I believe in you.","author":"Ken Poirot, Mentor Me: GA=T+EA Formula to Fulfill Your Greatest Achievement","category":"author-ken-poirot, believe, believe-in-others, believe-quote, believe-quotes, conviction, conviction-quote, conviction-quotes, give-support, greater-power, greater-power-quote, greater-power-quotes, greater-support, i-believe-in-you, in-the-eye, ken-poirot, ken-poirot-quote, ken-poirot-quotes, look-them-in-the-eye, mentor-me, mentor-me-book, mentor-me-book-quote, mentor-me-book-quotes, mentor-me-gate, mentor-me-quote, mentor-me-quotes, power, power-and-support, power-quote, power-quotes, sincerity, sincerity-quote, sincerity-quotes, support, support-quotes, support-qutoe, supporting-others, supportive-actions, supportive-quote, supportive-quotes, supportiveness"},{"quote":"Adora Belle fought back, and to make sure fought back even before she was attacked.","author":"Terry Pratchett, Going Postal","category":"power, self-defence, strong-female-characters"},{"quote":"In a sense, I am a moralist, insofar as I believe that one of the tasks, one of the meanings of human existencethe source of human freedomis never to accept anything as definitive, untouchable, obvious, or immobile.

There is nothing new or recent about fearit is doubtless as old as the life of man on the planet. Fears are of many kindsfear of objects, fear of people, fear of the future, fear of nature, fear of the unknown, fear of old age, fear of disease, and fear of life itself. Then there is fear which has to do with aspects of experience and detailed states of mind.Our homes, institutions, prisons, churches, are crowded with people who are hounded by day and harrowed by night because of some fear that lurks ready to spring into action as soon as one is alone, or as soon as the lights go out, or as soon as ones social defenses are temporarily removed.The ever-present fear that besets the vast poor, the economically and socially insecure, is a fear of still a different breed. It is a climate closing in; it is like the fog in San Francisco or in London. It is nowhere in particular yet everywhere. It is a mood which one carries around with himself, distilled from the acrid conflict with which his days are surrounded. It has its roots deep in the heart of the relations between the weak and the strong, between the controllers of environment and those who are controlled by it.When the basis of such fear is analyzed, it is clear that it arises out of the sense of isolation and helplessness in the face of the varied dimensions of violence to which the underprivileged are exposed. Violence, precipitate and stark, is the sire of the fear of such people. It is spawned by the perpetual threat of violence everywhere. Of course, physical violence is the most obvious cause. But here, it is important to point out, a particular kind of physical violence or its counterpart is evidenced; it is violence that is devoid of the element of contest. It is what is feared by the rabbit that cannot ultimately escape the hounds.","author":"Howard Thurman","category":"human-rights, inspirational, poverty, power, violence"},{"quote":"Sometimes it's like: If something terrifies you, you should totally do it BECAUSE it terrifies you.

People dont realize they need to rely on the memories of other organisms to survive. You think that flowers bloom in colorful profusion just to please your eyes.

That a sambar deer, its head bent low to sip at a creek is not a revelation . . . When in fact the finest movement of any organism represents a change in an ecosystem.

One of the things that is so profoundly exciting and challenging about this moment is that as a result of this power illiteracy that is so pervasive, there is a concentration of knowledge, of understanding, of clout. I mean, think about it: How does a friendship become a subsidy? Seamlessly, when a senior government official decides to leave government and become a lobbyist for a private interest and convert his or her relationships into capital for their new masters. How does a bias become a policy? Insidiously, just the way that stop-and-frisk, for instance, became over time a bureaucratic numbers game. How does a slogan become a movement? Virally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance, was able to take the \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" flag from the American Revolution, or how, on the other side, a band of activists could take a magazine headline, \\"Occupy Wall Street,\\" and turn that into a global meme and movement. The thing is, though, most people aren't looking for and don't want to see these realities. So much of this ignorance, this civic illiteracy, is willful. There are some millennials, for instance, who think the whole business is just sordid. They don't want to have anything to do with politics. They'd rather just opt out and engage in volunteerism. There are some techies out there who believe that the cure-all for any power imbalance or power abuse is simply more data, more transparency. There are some on the left who think power resides only with corporations, and some on the right who think power resides only with government, each side blinded by their selective outrage. There are the naive who believe that good things just happen and the cynical who believe that bad things just happen, the fortunate and unfortunate unlike who think that their lot is simply what they deserve rather than the eminently alterable result of a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation, of power.","author":"Eric Liu","category":"change, democracy, power"},{"quote":"Civic imagination and innovation and creativity are emerging from local ecosystems now and radiating outward, and this great innovation, this great wave of localism that's now arriving, and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live their everyday lives, this isn't some precious parochialism, this isn't some retreat into insularity, no. This is emergent. The localism of our time is networked powerfully. And so, for instance, consider the ways that strategies for making cities more bike-friendly have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle. Think about how experiments in participatory budgeting, where everyday citizens get a chance to allocate and decide upon the allocation of city funds. Those experiments have spread from Porto Alegre, Brazil to here in New York City, to the wards of Chicago. Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles and many cities between are now organizing to stage strikes to remind the people who live in their cities what a day without immigrants would look like. In China, all across that country, members of the New Citizens' Movement are beginning to activate and organize to fight official corruption and graft, and they're drawing the ire of officials there, but they're also drawing the attention of anti-corruption activists all around the world. In Seattle, where I'm from, we've become part of a great global array of cities that are now working together bypassing government altogether, national government altogether, in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals of the Kyoto Protocol.

That is, is it conserved by the universe, or is it like shares of a stock, which may have great value one day, and be worthless the next? If power is like stock shares, then it follows that the immense sum thereof lately lost by B[olingbroke] has vanished like shadows in sunlight. For no matter how much wealth is lost in stock crashes, it never seems to turn up, but if power is conserved, then Bs must have gone somewhere. Where is it? Some say twas scooped up by my Lord R, who hid it under a rock, lest my Lord M come from across the sea and snatch it away. My friends among the Whigs say that any power lost by a Tory is infallibly and insensibly distributed among all the people, but no matter how assiduously I search the lower rooms of the clink for Bs lost power, I cannot seem to find any there, which explodes that argument, for there are assuredly very many people in those dark salons. I propose a novel theory of power, which is inspired by . . . the engine for raising water by fire. As a mill makes flour, a loom makes cloth and a forge makes steel, so we are assured this engine shall make power. If the backers of this device speak truly, and I have no reason to deprecate their honesty, it proves that power is not a conserved quantity, for of such quantities, it is never possible to make more. The amount of power in the world, it follows, is ever increasing, and the rate of increase grows ever faster as more of these engines are built. A man who hordes power is therefore like a miser who sits on a heap of coins in a realm where the currency is being continually debased by the production of more coins than the market can bear. So that what was a great fortune, when first he raked it together, insensibly becomes a slag heap, and is found to be devoid of value. When at last he takes it to the marketplace to be spent. Thus my Lord B and his vaunted power hoard what is true of him is likely to be true of his lackeys, particularly his most base and slavish followers such as Mr. Charles White.

I thought a lot about what I should write to you. I thought of giving you blessings and wishes for things of great value to happen to you in future; I thought of appreciating you for being the way you are; I thought to give sweet and lovely compliments for everything about you; I thought to write something in praise of your poems and prose; and I thought of extending my gratitude for being one of the very few sincerest friends I have ever had. But that is what all friends do and they only qualify to remain as a part of the bunch of our loosely connected memories and that's not what I can choose to be, I cannot choose to be lost somewhere in your memories. So I thought of something through which I hope you will remember me for a very long time. I decided to share some part of my story, of what led me here, the part we both have had in common. A past, which changed us and our perception of the world. A past, which shaped our future into an unknown yet exciting opportunity to revisit the lost thoughts and to break free from the libido of our lost dreams. A past, which questioned our whole past. My dear, when the moment of my past struck me, in its highest demonised form, I felt dead, like a dead-man walking in flesh without a soul, who had no reason to live any more. I no longer saw any meaning of life but then I saw no reason to die as well. I travelled to far away lands, running away from friends, family and everyone else and I confined myself to my thoughts, to my feelings and to myself. Hours, days, weeks and months passed and I waited for a moment of magic to happen, a turn of destiny, but nothing happened, nothing ever happens. I waited and I counted each moment of it, thinking about every moment of my life, the good and the bad ones. I then saw how powerful yet weak, bright yet dark, beautiful yet ugly, joyous yet grievous; is a one single moment. One moment makes the difference. Just a one moment. Such appears to be the extreme and undisputed power of a single moment. We live in a world of appearance, Abigail, where the reality lies beyond the appearances, and this is also only what appears to be such powerful when in actuality it is not. I realised that the power of the moment is not in the moment itself. The power, actually, is in us. Every single one of us has the power to make and shape our own moments. It is us who by feeling joyful, celebrate for a moment of success; and it is also us who by feeling saddened, cry and mourn over our losses. I, with all my heart and mind, now embrace this power which lies within us. I wish life offers you more time to make use of this power. Remember, we are our own griefs, my dear, we are our own happinesses and we are our own remedies.Take care!Love,Francis.Title: Letter to AbigailScene: \\"Death-bed\\"Chapter: The Road To Awe","author":"Huseyn Raza","category":"brokenness, death-is-the-road-to-awe, death-note, desires, dreams, gift, happiness, inspirational, letter, life-and-death, life-changing, life-lessons, love, moments, no-regrets, peace, power, power-of-now, power-of-thoughts, regrets, remedy, remember-me, road-to-awe, true-friends"},{"quote":"Write something simple like water, it will have the power to change you and the world.","author":"Debasish Mridha","category":"change, debasish, life, mridha, philosophy, power, simple, world, write"},{"quote":"Your ability is your power.

They are indeed weak and easily influenced, because they confidently give themselves to others; they are simple certainly, but often with a very attractive simplicity.

Who amongst us has not been moved when met by the warm welcome of our boys and girls, by their smiles, their confidence and their outstretched arms. Free from the bonds of conventional society, and of ambition, they are free, not with the ambitious freedom of reason, but with an interior freedom, that of friendship. Who has not been struck by the rightness of their judgments upon the goodness or evil of men, by their profound intuition on certain human truths, by the truth and simplicity of their nature which seeks not so much to appear to be, as to be.

When you come closer to him, you will find that his inner being is transcendence. You will meet the unknown, where the world disappears and God appears. You can trust him, because he is like you. He is part of your suffering, pain and sorrow, but he is also transcendental. That is why Jesus became a mile stone in the history of human consciousness. Jesus lived and loved with truth and grace. Jesus being was truth and grace. Whenever truth is there, grace is there. And whenever grace is there, truth is there. To come closer to Jesus, you have to find your own inner being, the kingdom of God. That is the whole message of Jesus. Then you will find that God is eternal. God is the whole existence.

Our humble and astonishing inheritance is the world and only the world, whose existence we constantly test (and prove) by telling ourselves stories about it.

And our love for it, and our lust to see more of it, and our pride in its accomplishments as we wander through shelves full of books that promise more and more delights, are among our happiest, most moving proofs of possessing, in spite of all the miseries and sorrows of this life, a more intimate, consolatory, perhaps redeeming faith in a method behind the madness than any jealous deity could wish upon us.","author":"Alberto Manguel, The Library at Night","category":"books, consolation, god, libraries, meaning, naturalism, world"},{"quote":"The world is not beautiful: And that, in a way, lends it a sort of beauty.","author":"Kino no Tabi","category":"beauty, world"},{"quote":"Take over the school, take over the town, take over the worlds.

Maybe the country was going through its adolescent phase and breaking out with a bad case of social acne. Cheesy professors were running around the country proclaiming turn on, tune in, drop out. A mean-spirited drunk from LA was cranking out poems about the low-life and reaching for another beer out of the refrigerator on stage as part of his performance.

Mothers thought they were educating their kids by letting them watch Sesame Street, but they were just turning their kids into TV junkies and a future generation of pudding heads with blank faces ready to believe anything on the lamestream media. The Vietnam War eventually came to an end after Laos was clustered bombed, which had nothing to do with ending the war. Dominoes didnt fall. A new war memorial went out for bid. Some crazy scientist found a way to make clothes out of chemicals - polyester. Dwarfs found their favorite hangout - the disco. The whole country seemed to be dancing to the disco beat, hypnotized by the flashing strobe lights off the big, shiny ball.","author":"Robert Hobkirk, Tommy in the Promised Land","category":"quote"},{"quote":"Let not a single soul discharge you, because we are a group of beautiful people...and you two are richer, with greater potential than this soil.","author":"Curtis W.

These are strong fetishes, each conjuring the powerful submedial in a particular way. Yet all of them must nonetheless be exchanged in a certain rhythm according to the laws of the medial economy. In order to create such fetishes, one does not have to use brilliant quotes by famous authors but can use anonymous quotes that stem from the author- less realm of the everyday, lowly, foreign, vulgar, aggressive, or stupid. Precisely such quotes produce the effect of medial sincerity, that is, the revelation of a deeply submerged, hidden, medial plane on the familiar medial surface. It then appears as if this surface had been blasted open from the inside and that the respective quotes had sprung forth from the submedial interiorlike aliens. All of this, of course, refers to the economy of the quote as a gift that can be offered, accepted, and reciprocated.","author":"Boris Groys, Under Suspicion: A Phenomenology of Media","category":"quote"},{"quote":"A man's primary duty in life is to earn his own living, but to what purpose if he did not have a wife and children?","author":"Mario Puzo, The Last Don","category":"duty-of-man, mario-puzo, quote, the-last-don"},{"quote":"An author who integrates alien signs into the medial surface of his own textssigns behind which we presume the existence of other powerful, submedial subjects as authorsdoes not increase the comprehensibility of that text. Yet nonetheless, he increases the magical effectiveness this text exudes. Such quotations lead us to presume that the text houses a dangerous, manipulative subject, a magician with enough power to manipulate the signs of other powerful magicians and able to use them strategically for his own purposes. Thus an author who quotes alien signs conveys a stronger impression of powerful authorship than one who ad- vocates precisely his so-called own ideaswhich do not interest anybody precisely because they are only his own. It is also well known that one may not quote the same author too often, in which case quoting gradu- ally looses its magical power and begins to irritate the reader. The reason for this gradual decrease of a quotes magical effectiveness is that it looses its strangeness over time and gets integrated into the medial surface of a text, thereby becoming a proper part of it. In order to maintain their magical effect, quotes have to be exchanged constantly so as to continue to maintain the same appearance of foreignness and freshness. The quote functions as a magical fetish that lends the entire text a hidden, submedial power beyond its superficial meaning.","author":"Boris Groys, Under Suspicion: A Phenomenology of Media","category":"fetish, quote"},{"quote":"The old me is sure making things difficult for the current me.","author":"Colleen Hoover, Never Never: Part Two","category":"changing, irony, memory-loss, quote"},{"quote":"disregard the opinions of those you don't aspire to be, that's the first step to finding your own two feet.","author":"Nikki Rowe","category":"awaken, awareness, find-yourself, free-spirit, individual, life, love-yourself, quote"},{"quote":"Valuing your LIFE, what do you believe in?

True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from the schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain't a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.","author":"Herman Melville, Moby-Dick or, The Whale","category":"adventure, herman-melville, life, moby-dick, quote, travel"},{"quote":"He asked her for coffee, but she wanted tea instead.","author":"Ljupka Cvetanova, The New Land","category":"coffee, coffee-quotes, dating, dating-quotes, go-out, love, man, misunderstanding, quote, quote-about-going-out, relationship, tea, woman"},{"quote":"He has his head in the clouds.

These songs and albums were the best ones because of how huge adolescence felt then, and how nostalgia recasts it now. Nostalgia is so certain: the sense of familiarity it instills makes us feel like we know ourselves, like weve lived. To get a sense that we have already journeyed through something- survived it, experienced it- is often so much easier and less messy than the task of currently living though something. Though hard to grasp, nostalgia is elating to bask in- temporarily restoring color to the past. It creates a sense memory that momentarily simulates context. Nostalgia is recall without the criticism of the present day, all the good parts, memory without the pain. Finally, nostalgia asks so little of us, just to be noticed and revisited; it doesnt require the difficult task of negotiation, the heartache and uncertainty that the present does.","author":"Carrie Brownstein, Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl","category":"carrie-brownstein, hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl, nostalgia, quote"},{"quote":"The differences between women are all cosmetic.","author":"Ljupka Cvetanova, The New Land","category":"cosmetic, cosmetics, difference, difference-between-men-and-women, differences-between-people, ironical, irony, life, love, make-it-better, make-it-through, make-up, makeup, quote, quotes-about-women, sarcasm"},{"quote":"Kamand, die every dayso you rememberto live.","author":"Kamand Kojouri","category":"adage, alive, aliveness, aphorism, aware, awareness, carpe-diem, consciousness, death, die, inspirational-quote, kamand, kamand-kojouri, kojouri, life, life-philosophy, live, living, maxim, moment, motto, now, philosophy, poem, power-of-now, present, present-moment, quote, realisation, realise, recognise, remember, seize, short-poem, surrender, truth"},{"quote":"There is no remedy for love but to love more.\\"- Henry David Thoreau","author":"Henry David Thoreau","category":"love, quote, thoreau"},{"quote":"No one has any right to tell you that the way you perceive yourself is wrong.

Worse still, imagine this same soldier has his enemy in his sites and the enemy appears defenseless. Here, he might be allowed the luxury to have that moment with himself to debate whether he should pull the trigger or not. But on another day he may not have that luxury. Imagine further, a soldier is in this situation because his father was a soldier, and his grandfather was a soldier, and he is trying to please them but, unlike them, he doesnt believe killing people in war is right, yet there he is on the battlefield anyway where killed or be killed leads the list in the armys operation manual. So, he pulls the trigger anyway even though hes categorically against killing another human being. And maybe this is the first time hes compromised on such a high principle and he continues killing other people as long as hes in the war and each time it becomes easier and easier until his principle, his absolute truth, is a motto not to live by, but one that is just a topic of conversation in a philosophy class or a backyard barbecue.

Family circumstances of various kinds brought them together, and he grew to love her as a daughter, and had no fear that his love would change its nature. But he forgot that B was so young, that life was still a May-game to her and that it was easy to fall in love with her in a different way, and that this would amuse her. He made a mistake and was suddenly aware of another feeling, as heavy as remorse, making its way into his heart, and he was afraid. He was afraid that their old friendly relations would be destroyed, and he made up his mind to go away before that happened.","author":"Leo Tolstoy, Family Happiness","category":"family-happiness, leo-tolstoy, quote, story"},{"quote":"You cannot fight hate and violence with more hate and violence, any more than you can conquer darkness with more darkness.

He was a small man with a soft, friendly voice. He was not intimidating at all, until he lost it. In his defense, he took shit from all sides - from the members who wanted their favorite caddie and their preferred tee time, from the golf staff who wanted him to perform a million menial duties, and from us when we showed up bleary eyed and incoherent and sometimes didn't show up at all. And God forbid a caddie should stumble in late, because then Millweed's lips would begin to tremble and his blue eyes would explode from his head. They grew as large as saucers and shook as though his skull was suffering earthquake. And he appeared to grow with them. It was like some shaman or yogi trick. Pound for pound, I've never met anyone else who could so effectively deliver anger. He would yell, \\"You like fucking with me, don't you? You like making me look bad! You wake up and say, 'Today I'm gonna fuck with Millweed!' and it makes you happy, doesn't it?\\"And we had no choice but to stand there and take it - hang our heads and blubber apologies and promise never to be hung over again, never to show up late again, because he held the ultimate trump card _ he could fire us and cut us off from the golden tit. But once we were out on the course walking it off, the hanover and any cares associated with it (including Millweed) evaporated into the light mountain air. And after the round, with our pockets replenished and our spirits restored by the carefree, self-congratulatory ebullience of the uberrich, we were powerless to resist the siren song of clinking glasses, the inviting golden light of the street lamps and tavern windows in town, and the slopeside hot tubs steaming under the stars. We all jumped ship and dined, danced, and romanced the night away and then were dashed against the rocks of Millweed's wrath all over again the next morning.","author":"John   Dunn, Loopers: A Caddie's Twenty-Year Golf Odyssey","category":"aspen, caddie, golf, john-dunn, loopers, quote"},{"quote":"Although my road to writing seems like it may have come easily, there were a few bumps in that road.

One of the files was titled Operation Freakout. It concerned the treatment of Paulette Cooper, the journalist who had published an expos of Scientology, The Scandal of Scientology, six years earlier. After having been indicted for perjury and making bomb threats against Scientology, Cooper had gone into a deep depression. She stopped eating. At one point, she weighed just eighty-three pounds. She considered suicide. Finally, she persuaded a doctor to give her sodium pentothal, or truth serum, and question her under the anesthesia. The government was sufficiently impressed that the prosecutor dropped the case against her, but her reputation was ruined, she was broke, and her health was uncertain. The day after the FBI raid on the Scientology headquarters, Cooper was flying back from Africa, on assignment for a travel magazine, when she read a story in the International Herald Tribune about the raid. One of the files the federal agents discovered was titled Operation Freakout. The goal of the operation was to get Cooper incarcerated in a mental institution or jail.","author":"Lawrence Wright, Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief","category":"quote, scientology"},{"quote":"May our eyes focus rightly on Christ ... before the need to please others, before church, and before the busyness of Christian life.

Well, supposing, as I said, that you should offer to acquit me on these terms, I should reply 'Gentlemen, I am your very grateful and devoted servant, but I owe a greater obedience to God than to you; and so long as I draw breath and have my faculties, I shall never stop practicing philosophy and exhorting you and elucidating the truth for everyone that I meet.
