the international stage on 27 march 2007 during a westminster abbey church service held to recognize the 200th anniversary of great britains abolition of the slave trade act 1807 queen elizabeth ii was in attendance at the commemorative event which marked the british governments decision to end the atlantic slave trade although slavery in british colonies would continue until 1834in a dramatic display agbetu slipped past security guards at the 2007 service and strode into the open area in front of the church altar standing three metres away from the queen and shouting that the service was an insult to those of african heritage in subsequent interviews he called the service a selfcongratulatory exercise for those who promote oppression and those who continued to prevent the social and intellctual freedom of oppressed peoples as reported in major media he yelled at the queen you should be ashamed we should not be here this is an insult to us i want all the christians who are africans to walk out of here with me he was wrestled to the floor by security guards and removed from the church subsequently a storm of media interest erupted much of it negative the crown prosecution service advised that no charges be brought against him agbetu himself later explained in the guardian what happened from his perspectivei was moved to make a collective voice heard at the commemorative ritual of appeasement and selfapproval marking the bicentenary of the british parliamentary act to abolish what they disingenuously refer to as a slave tradethe wilberfest abolition commemoration has eradicated any mention of resistance rebellion and revolution instigated by millions of african people i stood up with my arms raised in a gesture of nonviolence and said not in our name to dr rowan williams who was attempting to lead the congregation which included a number of african people to their knees to beg gods forgiveness for slavery i went to the queen and said that in the history of the maafa the british are the nazis but where the germans had the humanity and humility to apologise and make reparations for the holocaust she in not doing so shames not only herself but her nationi then turned to tony blair and told him he ought to feel ashamed for his behaviour blair quickly averted his gaze the rest of what i said was directed to the members of my own community who were present i dont believe it was right for us to have remained in a venue in which the british monarchy government and church all leading institutions of african enslavement during the maafa collectively refused to atone for their sinsthen a gang of men attempted to drag me out through the back door on my knees i strongly asserted that i would be walking through the front door on my feet

noticed that the girls name and that of her teacher john ivesmail were both anagrams of jamie shovlin it is occasionally suggested that saatchi bought the work believing that jelish was real asked about this shovlin replied he fully knew what was going on but the more i think about it the more it adds another layer to the piece commenting on the exhibition jamie said i wouldnt call it a hoax

known for his two papers what numbers could not be 1965 and mathematical truth 1973 and for his anthology on the philosophy of mathematics coedited with hilary putnam he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1998in what numbers could not be he argues against a platonist view of mathematics and for structuralism on the ground that what is important about numbers is the abstract structures they represent rather than the objects that number words ostensibly refer to in particular this argument is based on the point that zermelo and von neumann give distinct and completely adequate identifications of natural numbers with setsin mathematical truth he argues that no interpretation of mathematics offers a satisfactory package of epistemology and semantics it is possible to explain mathematical truth in a way that is consistent with our syntacticosemantical treatment of truth in nonmathematical language and it is possible to explain our knowledge of mathematics in terms consistent with a causal account of epistemology but it is in general not possible to accomplish both of these objectives simultaneously he argues for this on the grounds that an adequate account of truth in mathematics implies the existence of abstract mathematical objects but that such objects are epistemologically inaccessible because they are causally inert and beyond the reach of sense perception on the other hand an adequate epistemology of mathematics say one that ties truthconditions to proof in some way precludes understanding how and why the truthconditions have any bearing on truth"},{"author":"Pat Bradley (basketball)","quote":"pat bradley born may 16 1976 is an american former basketball player and coachborn in everett massachusetts bradley was a break out

kinship terminology among eurasian ethnic groups having deep historical traditions of written records however though he seems to consider his results as having universal applicability they appear to be most applicable to the evolution of kinship terminology in eurasia and among the austronesians he has shown that among those peoples bifurcate merging systems tended to get transformed either into bifurcate collateral or generational ones on the other hand the lineal kinship terminology developed either from bifurcate collateral ones this development is most typical for eurasia or from generational systems note that these are not mere speculations as kryukov supported his conclusions with a wealth of diachronic data being a sinologist he paid special attention to the evolution of

gold standard and the great depression 19191939 oxford university press 1992 in his own book on the great depression ben bernanke summarized eichengreens thesis as follows the proximate cause of the world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard for a variety of reasons including among others a desire of the federal reserve to curb the us stock market boom monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late 1920sa contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard what was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of 1931 instigated an international scramble for gold sterilization of gold inflows by surplus countries the usa and france substitution of gold for foreign exchange reserves and runs on commercial banks all led to increases in the gold backing of money and consequently to sharp unintended declines in national money supplies monetary contractions in turn were strongly associated with falling prices output and employment effective international cooperation could in principle have permitted a worldwide monetary expansion despite gold standard constraints but disputes over world war i reparations and war debts and the insularity and inexperience of the federal reserve among other factors prevented this outcome as a result individual countries were able to escape the deflationary vortex only by unilaterally abandoning the gold standard and reestablishing domestic monetary stability a process that dragged on in a halting and uncoordinated manner until france and the other gold bloc countries finally left gold in 1936the main evidence eichengreen adduces in support of this view is the fact that countries that abandoned the gold standard earlier saw their economies recover more quicklyhis recent books include global imbalances and the lessons of bretton woods mit press september 2006 the european economy since 1945
