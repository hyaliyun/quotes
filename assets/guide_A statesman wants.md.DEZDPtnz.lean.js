I don&#39;t know why there&#39;s this big rush to do this.</p><p>Feels good to try, but playing a father, I&#39;m getting a little older.

We weren&#39;t rich, we were pretty middle-class. My dad survived from job to job with him taking care of so many relatives, he couldn&#39;t save any money.</p><p>Dad needs to show an incredible amount of respect and humor and friendship toward his mate so the kids understand their parents are sexy, they&#39;re fun, they do things together, they&#39;re best friends. Kids learn by example. If I respect Mom, they&#39;re going to respect Mom.</p><p>I like to think my dad was easygoing and kind, and I think some of those things have been passed down.

That&#39;s how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose.</p><p>My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love.

It&#39;s not a popular position.</p><p>And my dad, you&#39;re a great actor but you&#39;re a better father.</p><p>I&#39;ve got high standards when it comes to boys. As my dad says, all girls should!

I know that if I like a guy, he better be nice, and above all, my dad has to approve of him!</p><p>Don&#39;t forget Mother&#39;s Day. Or as they call it in Beverly Hills, Dad&#39;s Third Wife Day.</p><p>My father used to play with my brother and me in the yard. Mother would come out and say, &#39;You&#39;re tearing up the grass&#39; &#39;We&#39;re not raising grass,&#39; Dad would reply. &#39;We&#39;re raising boys.&#39;</p><p>When I was about 12 years old back in Houston, my Dad used to take us to the driving range.</p><p>My dad said to me growing up: &#39;When all is said and done, if you can count all your true friends on one hand, you&#39;re a lucky man.&#39;</p><p>I think a dad has to make his daughter feel that he&#39;s genuinely interested in what she&#39;s going through.</p><p>Apparently, one in five people in the world are Chinese.

But I think it&#39;s Colin.</p><p>Don&#39;t force your kids into sports. I never was. To this day, my dad has never asked me to go play golf. I ask him. It&#39;s the child&#39;s desire to play that matters, not the parent&#39;s desire to have the child play. Fun. Keep it fun.</p><p>It was my 16th birthday - my mom and dad gave me my Goya classical guitar that day. I sat down, wrote this song, and I just knew that that was the only thing I could ever really do - write songs and sing them to people.</p><p>Anyone can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a dad, and that&#39;s why I call you dad, because you are so special to me. You taught me the game and you taught me how to play it right.</p><p>My dad was like a stage mother he always pushed me to do what I wanted.</p><p>One of the greatest titles in the world is parent, and one of the biggest blessings in the world is to have parents to call mom and dad.</p><p>My dad encouraged us to fail. Growing up, he would ask us what we failed at that week. If we didn&#39;t have something, he would be disappointed. It changed my mindset at an early age that failure is not the outcome, failure is not trying. Don&#39;t be afraid to fail.</p><p>My dad was my best friend and greatest role model. He was an amazing dad, coach, mentor, soldier, husband and friend.</p><p>I never saw any of my dad&#39;s stories. My mother said he had piles and piles of manuscripts.</p><p>My dad used to say, &#39;You wouldn&#39;t worry so much about what people thought about you if you knew how seldom they did.</p><p>Dad taught me everything I know. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t teach me everything he knows.</p><p>All that really matters is I have two beautiful kids, and I&#39;m trying to be the best dad I can possibly be, and that&#39;s the most important thing of all.</p><p>I started out mopping floors, waiting tables, and tending bar at my dad&#39;s tavern. I put myself through school working odd jobs and night shifts. I poured my heart and soul into a small business. And when I saw how out-of-touch Washington had become with the core values of this great nation, I put my name forward and ran for office.</p><p>I always wanted what Mom and Dad had.</p><p>My dad is still Christian Scientist. My mom&#39;s not, and I&#39;m not. But I believe in God, and that there&#39;s a higher power and an intelligence that&#39;s bigger than us and that we can rely on. It&#39;s not just us, thinking we are the ones in control of everything. That idea gives me support.</p><p>Fortunately, as it pertains to guns, my dad and uncle introduced me to guns the way it needs to be done: smart, slow and safe.</p><p>My dad raised me with some good advice: &#39;Always tell the truth. Always shoot from the hip. You might not have many friends, but you&#39;ll never have enemies, because people will always know where you&#39;re coming from.&#39;</p><p>My dad is a motorcycle guy, not some Hollywood dude.</p><p>I feel lazy when I&#39;m not working. I learned all my business sense from my dad. He always believed in me, and I think the last thing he said to me before he passed away was, &#39;I know you&#39;re gonna be OK. I&#39;m not worried about you&#39;.</p><p>My dad loves what I do and I support my parents financially because they didn&#39;t have a job that gave them a pension.</p><p>My dad, bless him, was a musician. And his dad had thought that his music was rubbish.</p><p>I&#39;m a pretty hands-on dad and make the most of my custody. I take care of my little one whenever I can, and she determines what I can do and where I can do it.</p><p>And my dad drilled it in my head, you know, &#39;If you want it bad enough, and you&#39;re willing to make the sacrifices, you can do it. But first you have to believe in yourself.</p><p>But there&#39;s no substitute for a full-time dad. Dads who are fully engaged with their kids overwhelmingly tend to produce children who believe in themselves and live full lives.</p><p>I think I&#39;ve got my business notions and my sense for that sort of thing from my dad. My dad never had a chance to go to school. He couldn&#39;t read and write. But he was so smart. He was just one of those people that could just make the most of anything and everything that he had to work with.</p><p>When I was younger, my family would go camping and fishing on our ranches. My dad loves being around all kinds of animals. He&#39;s the one who got me to be a really big animal lover.</p><p>Where I come from, you don&#39;t really talk about how much you&#39;re earning. Those things are private. My dad never told my mum how much he was earning. I&#39;m certainly not going to tell the world. I&#39;m doing well.</p><p>My dad was a particularly polite kind of guy, very courteous.</p><p>Looking back, I think I was always musical. My dad was very musical, and I think my mom was musical.</p><p>I&#39;m very at ease, and I like it. I never thought I would be such a family-oriented guy I didn&#39;t think that was part of my makeup. But somebody said that as you get older you become the person you always should have been, and I feel that&#39;s happening to me. I&#39;m rather surprised at who I am, because I&#39;m actually like my dad!</p><p>I get that same queasy, nervous, thrilling feeling every time I go to work. That&#39;s never worn off since I was 12 years-old with my dad&#39;s 8-millimeter movie camera.</p><p>My dad took me to my first movie.</p><p>And I saw the sax line-up that he had behind him and I thought, I&#39;m going to learn the saxophone. When I grow up, I&#39;m going to play in his band. So I sort of persuaded my dad to get me a kind of a plastic saxophone on the hire purchase plan.</p><p>I love being a dad. I just love it.</p><p>My dad was the town drunk. Most of the time that&#39;s not so bad but New York City?</p><p>I wanted to be a skinny little ballerina but I was a voluptuous little Italian girl whose dad had meatballs on the table every night.</p><p>My dad became a soap opera actor, and I was an extra in a skating rink scene on the soap. I didn&#39;t audition. It was nepotism all the way.</p><p>My dad was good with actions.</p><p>My dad died of a stroke.</p><p>There is nothing that would upset me more than my dad being bribed by the press. It&#39;s like, &#39;Just let them run it, then. Don&#39;t you give them ammunition.&#39;</p><p>I have never been jealous. Not even when my dad finished fifth grade a year before I did.</p><p>I asked my daughter when she was 16, What&#39;s the buzz on the street with the kids? She&#39;s going, to be honest, Dad, most of my friends aren&#39;t into Kiss. But they&#39;ve all been told that it&#39;s the greatest show on Earth.</p><p>I&#39;m a dad, I&#39;m a husband, I&#39;m an activist, I&#39;m a writer and I&#39;m just a student of the world.</p><p>My Dad, a small-town lawyer, was also named Paul. Until we lost him when I was 16, he was a gentle presence in my life. I like to think he&#39;d be proud of me and my sister and brothers, because I&#39;m sure proud of him and of where I come from, Janesville, Wisconsin.</p><p>Mom was 50 when my Dad died. She got on a bus every weekday for years, and rode 40 miles each morning to Madison. She earned a new degree and learned new skills to start her small business. It wasn&#39;t just a new livelihood. It was a new life.</p><p>My mother raised three children on her own and my dad was a doctor working 16 hours a day.</p><p>Studies show that children best flourish when one mom and one dad are there to raise them.</p><p>As my dad said, you have an obligation to leave the world better than how you found it. And he also reminded us to be givers in this life, and not takers.</p><p>You see another side of Draco when he&#39;s with his dad. When Draco is with his dad, he doesn&#39;t say anything. He keeps his mouth shut. He&#39;s sort of bullied by his dad, so he acts very different.</p><p>I mean, I look at my dad. He was twenty when he started having a family, and he was always the coolest dad. He did everything for his kids, and he never made us feel like he was pressured. I know that it must be a great feeling to be a guy like that.</p><p>I was in the bath at the time, and my dad came running in and said, &#39;Guess who they want to play Harry Potter!?&#39; and I started to cry. It was probably the best moment of my life.</p><p>Working with my dad was such a gas. We approached the work in a similar way. We only made two films together when I was an adult, Tucker, and Blown Away, but it was so much fun to play with your parent like that.</p><p>For me, growing up, the downside of it was that as a kid you don&#39;t want to stand out. You don&#39;t want to have a famous father let alone get a job because of your famous father, you know? But I&#39;m a product of nepotism. That&#39;s how I got my foot in the door, through my dad.</p><p>Great dad. Yeah, he would ask me for money on birthdays and, you know, inappropriate times. And I just wrote him off like, &#39;You&#39;re not a father.&#39; I just learned you cannot emotionally invest in people who are not attainable.</p><p>Now I meditate twice a day for half an hour. In meditation, I can let go of everything. I&#39;m not Hugh Jackman. I&#39;m not a dad. I&#39;m not a husband. I&#39;m just dipping into that powerful source that creates everything. I take a little bath in it.</p><p>One afternoon when I was 9, my dad told me I&#39;d be skipping school the next day. Then we drove 12 hours from Melbourne to Sydney for the Centenary Test, a once-in-a-lifetime commemorative cricket match. It was great fun - especially for a kid who was a massive sports fan.</p><p>I don&#39;t know, I just want to be happy. I could be in a hole somewhere. Or I could completely lose it and be some hippy living in the woods with my dad.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know my dad for a long time. My dad was on drugs and my dad was at the VA Hospital, my dad was off in his own world selling drugs or using them or there would be crack heads in the house or whatever it would be.</p><p>My parents were working class folks. My dad was a bartender for most of his life, my mom was a maid and a cashier and a stock clerk at WalMart. We were not people of financial means in terms of significant financial means. I always told them, &#39;I didn&#39;t always have what I wanted. I always had what I needed.&#39; My parents always provided that.</p><p>My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a maid and a stock clerk at K-Mart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful. Because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them.</p><p>Without my dad, I wouldn&#39;t be here.</p><p>My dad played fiddle as well.</p><p>I want to be a young dad. By 25 or 26 I want to see myself, like, married or start looking for a family.</p><p>When I was younger, I had a perm, and it was really big. My mom was a hairdresser, so even my dad had a perm! I looked like a poodle, but it was cool at the time.</p><p>My friends say, &#39;Man you&#39;re going to have kids sleeping on pillowcases with your face on it! You&#39;re going to be on toothbrushes and magnets and stuff.&#39; I guess now that I&#39;m a dad, I&#39;m thrilled about that.</p><p>My kids are not that interested in my movie career, by the way. My son, in particular, never talks about it. He just wants me as his dad.</p><p>I&#39;ve never heard my dad say a bad word about anybody. He always keeps his emotions in check and is a true gentleman. I was taught that losing it was indulgent, a selfish act.</p><p>Now my dad is with me, traveling with me and a big part of this whole thing is I like to mix it up a little bit, you know. Who gets to take their father on a private jet across the country and stay in first class hotels? So we&#39;re enjoying it, but I&#39;d stop if it&#39;s not possible.</p><p>My dad used to say, &#39;Just because you dress up in a coat and tie, it doesn&#39;t influence your intelligence.&#39;</p><p>My Dad used to tell us: &#39;En este pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos&#39; &#39;In this country, you will be able to accomplish all the things we never could.&#39;</p><p>My dad, he is such a soft man. Even if he has these opinions about my boyfriends, he will be the sweetest guy. He will make you feel like you&#39;re fascinating and awesome, even if he doesn&#39;t like you that much.</p><p>I&#39;m not a religious person. My mom was of Jewish blood and my dad was Protestant.</p><p>My dad believes in God, I think. I&#39;m not sure if my mom does. I don&#39;t.</p><p>My dad&#39;s got a brilliant eye for scripts &#39;cos he&#39;s a literary agent. He and my agent read a load of scripts and filter them.</p><p>Joanna points her camera at a section of society unused to having cameras pointed at it. But I don&#39;t know about categorizing them in terms of class I&#39;m a bit wary of that. My dad is the son of a shipbuilder.</p><p>It&#39;s an ongoing joy being a dad.</p><p>My dad would give me $10, which is a lot of money when you&#39;re 9, to sing at church, on tables at restaurants, at family functions, just about anywhere.</p><p>I forgive my mom for being a psycho and my dad for being a loser.</p><p>It is a sad commentary of our times when our young must seek advice and counsel from &#39;Dear Abby&#39; instead of going to Mom and Dad.</p><p>There are absolutely no problems between me, my dad and my sister. Obviously I grew up with just my mum, but my relationship with my dad is just fine.</p><p>I try to be a hard boiled sometimes. My kids see right through it. I&#39;m acting. It&#39;s always, &#39;When I say you&#39;ll be back at 11, that means 11, not 11.15. Do you hear me!?&#39; Then, &#39;Yeah, Dad.&#39;</p><p>My grandfather and my uncle both died from colorectal cancer, my dad almost died from it and I have the gene for it.</p><p>A father and two sons run Adelphia. It&#39;s a cable company. And they took from that company a billion dollars. A billion. Three people - three people took a billion dollars. What were they gonna do, start their own space program? &#39;Let&#39;s send the monkey to Mars, Dad!&#39;</p><p>One of the scary things is that, when you&#39;re a kid, you look at your dad as the man who has no fear. When you&#39;re an adult, you realize your father had fear, and that you have it, too.</p><p>I&#39;m just a pretty regular dad.</p><p>I think my dad is a lot cooler than other dads. He still acts like he&#39;s still 17.</p><p>My dad says I could sing before I could talk, if that&#39;s possible. I was always humming and things like that.</p><p>I once said to my father, when I was a boy, &#39;Dad we need a third political party.&#39; He said to me, &#39;I&#39;ll settle for a second.&#39;</p><p>My Dad was my biggest supporter. He never put pressure on me.</p><p>My dad always used to tell me that if they challenge you to an after-school fight, tell them you won&#39;t wait-you can kick their ass right now.</p><p>I&#39;m a dad, and I no longer see a way for my kids to even inherit the money that I&#39;m making, let alone go out there, have an idea, and create it in their own lifetime.</p><p>I like all the angels around because they protect me and my daughter. I mean, her Dad&#39;s an angel.</p><p>My dad never blew anything up, but he probably had friends who did. He and my mom have always preached that the pen is mightier than a Molotov cocktail.</p><p>Overcoming my dad telling me that I could never amount to anything is what has made me the megalomaniac that you see today.</p><p>Going to the theater is such a joyous experience. My dad would take my sister and me to plays when we were very young, like six or seven years old.</p><p>My dad&#39;s a beautiful man, but like a lot of Mexican men, or men in general, a lot of men have a problem with the balance of masculinity and femininity - intuition and compassion and tenderness - and get overboard with the macho thing. It took him a while to become more, I would say, conscious, evolved.</p><p>My Dad is my hero.</p><p>I can definitely say the older I&#39;ve got the better I&#39;ve become at being a dad and a husband.</p><p>My dad always said, &#39;Champ, the measure of a man is not how often he is knocked down, but how quickly he gets up.&#39;</p><p>I was a mixture of being incredibly old for my age and incredibly backwards. I was born quite old, but then I stopped growing. I lived with my mum and dad till I was 30.</p><p>I&#39;m turning into a stricter dad.</p><p>I have four shelves covered with journals that I&#39;ve written. Dad and I are writing songs together. I&#39;ve probably written 100 songs.</p><p>I probably have an earlier curfew than anyone. My mom wants to keep me really safe and my dad&#39;s not overly protective, but he&#39;s a dad no matter what.</p><p>I don&#39;t really know any other musicians like me. I grew up backstage with my dad who played in a post-war dance band, so I always feel at home at a venue.</p><p>I love my dad and we have a very good relationship now.</p><p>I&#39;m the whitest guy you will ever meet. The first time I saw an African-American, my dad had to tell me to stop staring.</p><p>When I was little, we had a Golden Book that had all these Disney characters in one portrait on the first page. My dad used to read from it every night. We&#39;d play this game of find Pluto or find Donald Duck. He&#39;d read us stories and do all the voices. Those are great memories.</p><p>Most children - I know I did when I was a kid - fantasize another set of parents. Or fantasize no parents. They don&#39;t tell their real parents about that - you don&#39;t want to tell Mom and Dad. Kids lead a very private life. And I was a typical child, I think. I was a liar.</p><p>Most children - I know I did when I was a kid - fantasize another set of parents. Or fantasize no parents. They don&#39;t tell their real parents about that - you don&#39;t want to tell Mom and Dad.</p><p>My Dad is my hero. He&#39;s 85 now and he is in great health. He is handsome and strong. He has an incredible moral and ethical backbone. I couldn&#39;t have been luckier with my parents.</p><p>My dad was the district attorney of New Orleans for about 30 years. And when he opened his campaign headquarters back in the early &#39;70s, when I was 5 years old, my mother wanted me to play the national anthem. And they got an upright piano on the back of a flatbed truck and I played it.</p><p>My dad and mom believed that you do what you have to do in private and don&#39;t make a big deal out of it. Just try to help people as much as you can.</p><p>Well, my dad was the district attorney of New Orleans for about 30 years.</p><p>What I do now is all my dad&#39;s fault, because he bought me a guitar as a boy, for no apparent reason.</p><p>My dad bought me a guitar and people would ask me to play.</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t have got married. My dad told me. I was 35 and I got married. He said, &#39;You&#39;re too young to be married&#39;. &#39;What? I&#39;m 35&#39;. Said, &#39;You&#39;re far too young. You haven&#39;t lived yet&#39;. He was right, bless him, thanks, Dad.</p><p>My dad is a Deadhead, my mom&#39;s a Jewish-American princess from Jersey.</p><p>My mom was a waitress, and my dad was a plumber who worked for the City of San Clemente fixing mains breaks, so not too glamorous.</p><p>My dad, he&#39;s the rocker.</p><p>My dad got me a huge board when I was little. He loves to surf. He suited me up and sent me out on this huge wave. I went under, and when I came out and the board hit me in the face. So I said, I never wanted to do this again. I stayed away until I was 13.</p><p>We all started snowboarding in the beginning as a family just to be closer together, go on trips. It was our soccer, but instead of Dad yelling at me from the sideline he is there riding with me and hitting the jumps even before I am hitting them.</p><p>From 1965 to 1967, my dad, Jack Gilligan, served in Congress and helped pass landmark laws like the Voting Rights Act.</p><p>My dad always tell me to make decisions from love and not from fear.</p><p>My dad takes care of me as a manager and as a dad. That&#39;s his job, you know, to take care of me. He has my best interests at heart.</p><p>I can talk to my dad like he&#39;s my manager, and put &#39;Dad&#39; on the back burner. We&#39;ve been doing it since I was 13.</p><p>My dad&#39;s a doctor, and when I was 8, I went to one of his medical conferences where they were demonstrating laser surgery on a chicken. I was so mad that a chicken had to die, I never ate meat again.</p><p>When I was in nursery school, the teachers asked me, y&#39;know, &#39;What does your dad do for a living?&#39; So I said &#39;He helps women get pregnant!&#39; They called my mom and they were like, &#39;What exactly does your husband do?&#39;</p><p>You always hear people saying, &#39;I hope I&#39;m not turning into my dad&#39;, but I&#39;d be honoured if I became half as decent a bloke as he is.</p><p>I came back from university thinking I knew all about politics and racism, not knowing my dad had been one of the youngest-serving Labour councillors in the town and had refused to work in South Africa years ago because of the situation there. And he&#39;s never mentioned it - you just find out. That&#39;s a real man to me. A sleeping lion.</p><p>I wanted to be a mechanic. When I was 14 I wanted to quit school and go work on my car. But my dad said Son, you shouldn&#39;t do that. You should stay in school until your education is finished, and when you&#39;re done, don&#39;t make your hobby your job.</p><p>My dad taught me from my youngest childhood memories through these connections with Aboriginal and tribal people that you must always protect people&#39;s sacred status, regardless of the pest.</p><p>I haven&#39;t been baptised. My dad&#39;s not in the church and is not a religious person. My mum is more spiritual - she does Thai-chi and goes to Stonehenge and things like that. I&#39;m proud to be pagan. Finland is not really a religious country. I&#39;m still looking for my god.</p><p>My dad was a Methodist minister.</p><p>The problem with me, as far as getting married and having a family, is that my comedy is so important to me. So I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever be as good a dad as my dad.</p><p>But my dad also was a remarkable man, a good person, a principled individual, a man of integrity.</p><p>My dad was a militant atheist, or is a militant atheist. My mum was sort of bought up in a religious family because she was a Protestant from Ireland but wasn&#39;t especially religious.</p><p>My dad had a commercial film company, so he had a videotape player before anyone. So he got Mel Brooks movies or Citizen Kane or some classic old movies. And every summer the revival house in Evanston would show the great films from the &#39;50s and &#39;60s and &#39;70s.</p><p>I go off and make movies I come home, and I&#39;m a dad and I hang with my girls.</p><p>They have had such a crazy life living with me as their dad. Not crazy but different from their friends.</p><p>Yeah, my dad bought me a guitar when I was like 10, and I didn&#39;t really want it then.</p><p>I&#39;ve dated all kinds of guys and didn&#39;t know who I&#39;d end up with. But I kind of assumed it would be someone more like my dad than not.</p><p>My dad&#39;s whole family is in Madras and I was born in America so we didn&#39;t have that big Indian community. I don&#39;t really have anything interesting to say about it. When I talk about it people are like, &#39;meh, let&#39;s talk about something else.&#39;</p><p>I have to remind my dad, &#39;Journalists - no matter how many cigars they smoke with you - are not your friends, so don&#39;t talk to them.&#39;</p><p>I like to believe that I&#39;ve got a lot of guardian warriors sittin&#39; on my shoulder including my dad.</p><p>I used to say, &#39;Man, I think I&#39;d be a really good dad. I&#39;ll be a great provider. I&#39;m funny I&#39;ll go on trips with them - I&#39;ll do all sorts of stuff.&#39; But the momming? I&#39;m not made for that. I have a really good mom I know what she put into it.</p><p>My dad&#39;s probably one of the kindest people in the world. When I was younger that&#39;s not how I was- I was a little spoiled brat.</p><p>I spent a lot of time on farms when I was young. My uncle and my dad owned a big farm.</p><p>I have this complex. I don&#39;t like too much exposure. I don&#39;t know why it is. Maybe it&#39;s bred in me, because my dad always told me to be humble and don&#39;t think you&#39;re too good.</p><p>And of course I&#39;ve got kids of my own now, and they love me being in the Harry Potter films. I&#39;m now part of a phenomenon. You become incredibly cool to your kids, and you get a young fan base. So you became the cool dad at school. You&#39;re suddenly hip.</p><p>Nil By Mouth&#39; was a bit autobiographical, but as I always pointed out at the time, that&#39;s not my dad.;Gary Oldman;dad 12370;I couldn&#39;t walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.;David Icke;dad 12371;I sort of always had an inkling towards some kind of an art form. I grew up in a very small town, and I just figure-skated. My dad played hockey and I was surrounded by sports, but it wasn&#39;t quite doing it for me. I wasn&#39;t totally fulfilled, and I did a lot of skating.;Rachel McAdams;dad 12372;Also for me it was different because I play a lot of villains and in this one I play a dad and I play a good guy, basically. He&#39;s the Secretary of the Treasury. I never had a job like that.;Christopher Walken;dad 12373;I didn&#39;t come from a trailer park. I grew up middle class and my dad had money and my mom made my lunch. I got a car when I was sixteen. I&#39;m proud of that.;Kid Rock;dad 12374;In addition, there is one title I cherish a great deal more than Congressman and that is the title of... Dad.;J. C. Watts;dad 12375;My dad was the biggest influence on my life because he was never boring.;Christian Bale;dad 12376;Look, I&#39;ve got incredible pride for my family. I&#39;ve absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly.;Christian Bale;dad 12377;I met my grandfather just before he died, and it was the first time that I had seen Dad with a relative of his. It was interesting to see my own father as a son and the body language and alteration in attitude that comes with that, and it sort of changed our relationship for the better.;Christian Bale;dad 12378;My family belongs to a tennis club in Valencia, California, so I always go there. I play a lot of tennis with my dad and swim. And I like to go to the gym there.;Ashley Tisdale;dad 12379;My sister is totally my dad&#39;s daughter because she loves sports.;Ashley Tisdale;dad 12380;Music was always the distraction, so it was the obvious choice to pursue. My dad always said to find a job I love to do, that way it wouldn&#39;t feel like a job. So I did that.;Jason Mraz;dad 12381;I&#39;ll back up anything my dad says.;Floyd Mayweather, Jr.;dad 12382;To be fair to my dad, he is one of the brightest men I&#39;ve ever met.;Philip Seymour Hoffman;dad 12383;A spirit is, like, your mother, my dad, who&#39;ve made it. They can come around, but they come around in a loving way because they&#39;ve already made it to God. Most people make it.;Sylvia Browne;dad 12384;I grew up in a house where my father encouraged my brother and me to fail. I specifically remember coming home and saying, &#39;Dad, Dad, I tried out for this or that and I was horrible,&#39; and he would high-five me and say, &#39;Way to go.</p><p>My humanitarian work evolved from being with my family. My mom, my dad, they really set a great example for giving back. My mom was a nurse, my dad was a school teacher. But my mom did a lot of things for geriatrics and elderly people. She would do home visits for free.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t like I was self-motivated. My dad started me. It was his dream before it was mine.</p><p>I&#39;m always on the court with my dad.</p><p>You get to a certain age and you can&#39;t judge yourself on your dad or your parents.</p><p>Not much shocked me. You know, I worked in a home for Alzheimer&#39;s patients and my dad used to be really into murders and stuff, so I saw dead bodies. It desensitised me to a lot of things.</p><p>The only day I remember of my parents&#39; marriage was the day my dad walked out. As I stood there at five years old, with my older sister and younger brother, I knew that he was gone.</p><p>I Know You Care&#39; is about my dad. And I haven&#39;t seen him for a long, long time. And my parents divorced when I was really young. And I guess I just wanted a - it was my way of saying that I wasn&#39;t bitter or angry anymore. I was just sad and just felt like something was missing.;Ellie Goulding;dad 12392;My father came from a very poor background, but I was very fortunate in the sense that we were never in need. My dad was determined to make sure that we didn&#39;t want for things. He wanted to give us more opportunity than he had, a better shot at a better life.;Brad Pitt;dad 12393;Since I was a boy, from this house, I was out rescuing crocodiles and snakes. My mum and dad were very passionate about that and, I was lucky enough to go along.;Steve Irwin;dad 12394;My mother and dad were big animal lovers, too. I just don&#39;t know how I would have lived without animals around me. I&#39;m fascinated by them - both domestic pets and the wild community. They just are the most interesting things in the world to me, and it&#39;s made such a difference in my lifetime.;Betty White;dad 12395;During the Depression, my dad made radios to sell to make extra money. Nobody had any money to buy the radios, so he would trade them for dogs. He built kennels in the backyard, and he cared for the dogs.;Betty White;dad 12396;Losing my parents was the most crushing thing that ever happened to me. I lost my dad when I was 26, and it changed my life entirely.;Harlan Coben;dad 12397;My father was the quintessential husband and dad.;Sidney Poitier;dad 12398;My mother taught public school, went to Harvard and then got her master&#39;s there and taught fifth and sixth grade in a public school. My dad had a more working-class lifestyle. He didn&#39;t go to college. He was an auto mechanic and a bartender and a janitor at Harvard.;Ben Affleck;dad 12399;I was always a kid trying to make a buck. I borrowed a dollar from my dad, went to the penny candy store, bought a dollar&#39;s worth of candy, set up my booth, and sold candy for five cents apiece. Ate half my inventory, made $2.50, gave my dad back his dollar.;Guy Fieri;dad 12400;Come Christmas Eve, we usually go to my mom and dad&#39;s. Everybody brings one gift and then we play that game when we all steal it from each other. Some are really cool, others are useful and some are a bit out there.;Amy Grant;dad 12401;I was born and raised in East Los Angeles by a single mom who had three biological kids and adopted four more. I never met my dad.;will.i.am;dad 12402;I didn&#39;t know my Dad - he moved out early. And my mom&#39;s politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didn&#39;t think about Democrats or Republicans. She thought about who made sense. I&#39;ve been both in my life.;Dennis Miller;dad 12403;My dad was a labourer and my mum had exactly the same job as Noel Gallagher&#39;s mum - she was a dinner lady at our local school. Everyone comes over from Ireland and they get the same jobs.;Danny Boyle;dad 12404;I think my dad has helped me tremendously.;Rand Paul;dad 12405;My dad was dean of fine arts at the university. I was casting bronzes in the school foundry. I was using the university as a playground.;Maya Lin;dad 12406;My dad didn&#39;t drive - the only dad I knew who didn&#39;t.;Julie Burchill;dad 12407;When I moved out of London 13 years ago, I found a whole other reason not to drive. This was because my new husband Dan, unlike my dad, did drive, and this became a great source of fun and adventure.;Julie Burchill;dad 12408;And I love Mel Brooks. My Dad loved his movies, too, they&#39;re awesome, the kind of thing that if you&#39;re in for ten minutes, you&#39;re in for two hours.;Mike Myers;dad 12409;One of the things I like about when I tour sometimes is that occasionally you&#39;ll see a dad there with his 12-year-old son and they&#39;re both enjoying it.;Tim Vine;dad 12410;Yes, I always remember my dad&#39;s, mom&#39;s and my grandma&#39;s perfumes.;Marc Jacobs;dad 12411;Becoming a dad was the proudest moment of my life. Playing football does not even compare.;Wayne Rooney;dad 12412;I&#39;ve never been a hands-on dad. I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it, but you can&#39;t run a restaurant and be home for tea at 4:30 and bath and change nappies.;Gordon Ramsay;dad 12413;I want my kids to see me as Dad, for God&#39;s sake, not a television personality.;Gordon Ramsay;dad 12414;I was always embarrassed because my dad wore a suit and my mother wore flat pumps and a cozy jumper while my friends&#39; parents were punks or hippies.;Shirley Manson;dad 12415;You do need parental guidance and I was in a great position with both my mum and dad. They split when I was a baby but even though I stayed with my mom they were both very much involved in my upbringing.;Leonardo DiCaprio;dad 12416;Barack Obama knows that to create an economy built to last, we need to focus on middle-class families. Families who stay up on Sunday nights pacing the floor, like my dad did, while their children, tucked in bed, dream big dreams. Families who aren&#39;t sure what Monday morning will bring, but who believe our nation&#39;s best days are still ahead.;Charles Schumer;dad 12417;I would have to say the person with whom I am most in love is definitely my son, Everly Bear. Although I&#39;m his dad, I&#39;m also his friend.;Anthony Kiedis;dad 12418;My dad was in the army. World War II. He got his college education from the army. After World War II he became an insurance salesman. Really, I didn&#39;t know my dad very well. He and my mother split up after the war. I was raised by my maternal grandmother and grandfather, and by my mother.;Al Pacino;dad 12419;My mom and dad met at Anaheim High School. After they got married, all they wanted to do was have four children, and they did.;Gwen Stefani;dad 12420;But I honestly don&#39;t read critics. My dad reads absolutely everything ever written about me. He calls me up to read ecstatic reviews, but I always insist that I can&#39;t hear them. If you give value to the good reviews, you have to give value to the criticism.;Fiona Apple;dad 12421;My dad was a Communist Party member who fought for his country.;Tim Roth;dad 12422;Paul McCartney had a baby when he was 61 Rod Stewart was 66 Rupert Murdoch was a stunning 72. Not only does that mean they&#39;ll have less stamina than the average dad, that means they&#39;ll, well, check out a lot sooner too.;Jeffrey Kluger;dad 12423;The golden child may be the oldest one, unless it&#39;s the youngest. It may be the toughest one, unless it&#39;s the most sensitive. It&#39;s not even necessary that Mom and Dad have the same favorite - and typically they don&#39;t.;Jeffrey Kluger;dad 12424;My dad spent his whole life getting into fights for telling what he believed to be the truth. Basically it comes from my dad-and he&#39;s screaming right-wing, so there you are.;Thom Yorke;dad 12425;When my dad divorced my mom it was kind of like him leaving me also.;Nicole Richie;dad 12426;No matter how good you are, at some point your kids are gonna have to create their own independence and think that Mom and Dad aren&#39;t cool, just to establish themselves. That&#39;s what adolescence is about. They&#39;re gonna go through that no matter what.;Eddie Vedder;dad 12427;I think the hardest thing about making music now is being a great dad at the same time. There&#39;s an insanity that goes with writing - a mad scientist thing that you have to go through - and sacrificing a kid&#39;s upbringing to do that is not an option.;Eddie Vedder;dad 12428;My dad gave me my first bike at 16. I soon fell off and was in a wheelchair for weeks. I haven&#39;t fallen since.;Hugh Laurie;dad 12429;My dad always said he couldn&#39;t remember a time when I did not want to act.;Gwyneth Paltrow;dad 12430;My dad is a Jack Nicholson lookalike and a frustrated performer, my mother&#39;s into reading and poetry. I suppose the thing I owe them most is my confidence.;Michael Sheen;dad 12431;I was always okay with the fact that I was taller and bigger than everybody else growing up. My mom, my dad, and my friends always told me I was beautiful.;Jordin Sparks;dad 12432;If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I&#39;m a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.;Katherine Jenkins;dad 12433;In Heaven, I believe my dad is somewhere doing something nice. I feel I&#39;ve been too lucky to travel this far without somebody guiding me.;Katherine Jenkins;dad 12434;I was a very sickly kid. While I was in the hospital at age 7, my Dad brought me a stack of comic books to keep me occupied. I was hooked.;Len Wein;dad 12435;I&#39;ve never tried to find my real parents. I&#39;m very grateful to my mum and dad for adopting me - they&#39;re completely incredible people. It was my dad who encouraged me to question everything, to forge my own path, to think, to read. I always felt it was my right to question everything.;Dan Stevens;dad 12436;My dad was a mime and then he had his company and created plays for children and was very successful with it.;Marion Cotillard;dad 12437;My dad is the nicest guy you&#39;ll ever meet, and the easiest going.;Serena Williams;dad 12438;My dad is a marketing mastermind.;Serena Williams;dad 12439;I grew up in Chicago, so I&#39;ve always been a Bears fan. Dad used to take me to Bears games and Cubs games. My brother used to ride me over to Lake Forest College on his Honda Supersport and we&#39;d watch the Bears practice. I remember those guys out there as monsters - they were the biggest things I&#39;ve ever seen!;Kyle Chandler;dad 12440;When you&#39;re shooting a film, you really don&#39;t get to be a dad, and you don&#39;t really get to be a husband. You don&#39;t really exist at all. But I do drag my family with me on location whenever I can.;Eric Bana;dad 12441;I have a theory that I really want my kids to know - the only coloration that they make between dad being in films and reality is just a lot of people doing a lot of hard work.;Eric Bana;dad 12442;I hate being clean-shaven. My daughter gets very upset if I shave and says, &#39;Bring back the spikes, Dad.</p><p>My dad was a homicide cop in the gay neighborhood in the city when gay neighborhoods were desperate, depressing, sad places run by the mob. The only gay people he&#39;d met when I came out to him were corpses.</p><p>But while mum and dad were incredibly caring, it was also a very chaotic household where everyone fought about everything. So I know what it&#39;s like to internalize all that chaos.</p><p>My dad was diagnosed with cancer, so we ended up burying him a year to the day that he was diagnosed.</p><p>My role model is my dad.</p><p>My dad liked to boil a squirrel head and suck the brains out the nose. Smaller than a chicken, bigger than a rat.</p><p>My mother told me Homer Ditto was not my father. Nope. Mom had had a fling with some other guy who was my dad. Some dude who didn&#39;t stick around too long who Mom was happy to get rid of. She chose Homer, and Homer chose me, so he lent me his name even though I didn&#39;t have his blood.</p><p>If my Dad doesn&#39;t like you, you will know. My Mom is just too innocent to ever lie. She doesn&#39;t even cuss.</p><p>My father was so good-natured and had such a happy disposition. I&#39;ve always confused him with Jimmy Stewart. So, think Jimmy Stewart. That&#39;s my dad.</p><p>I am quite strict as a dad but I don&#39;t want to be censorious.</p><p>My dad&#39;s side of the family had lots of artists and musicians. There&#39;s an emotional, quite sentimental quality to Slavic culture. It&#39;s very open, it loves art, it loves music, it loves literature. It&#39;s very warm, it&#39;s very up, it&#39;s very down. I would celebrate that.</p><p>I say this as a young dad seeing children going into primary school: I don&#39;t think we should underestimate the formative effect on a child of those first years in primary school.</p><p>When I was really little I would sit in the back of my dad&#39;s car when he&#39;d be playing old-school music. He&#39;d turn down the music and turn around and I&#39;d be singing and know all of the words but I didn&#39;t even know how to talk. From then on I&#39;ve always wanted to be a singer.</p><p>I do love a bit of fashion. I grew up around a lot of it as my mum and dad had clothing stores so my mum was always designing a lot, and I definitely had that as an influence.</p><p>My dad is such a good man. You know how when you are a child you think your dad is invincible? Well, I still think that - he is so wise and everything I do I ask my dad&#39;s advice about first.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;ve lived quite a sheltered life, like my mom and dad were quite protective of me.</p><p>My dad was just a big Joseph Campbell nut.</p><p>I bought a house for my mom, I bought a house for my dad, I bought a house for my sister.</p><p>I watched Italia &#39;90 with my Mum and Dad and my brother, you know, leaping around the house when the penalties were on... It would be great to be part of that, to have that kind of impact.</p><p>I&#39;m not an American, but I have this weird connection to America in different ways through my dad living here for five years, my godfather being an American who I&#39;m very close to.</p><p>My dad was a baggage handler at Heathrow and careful with money. He worked hard and had three jobs when I was young. I wish I&#39;d inherited his care for money. Sadly, I&#39;ve grown up to be rather scatty when it comes to finances.</p><p>Before breaking into music, I had various jobs: forklift driver, driving a courier. But I was forced into working rather than doing it off my own bat because that was my dad&#39;s way: you got a job and paid your way.</p><p>I have one brother, John, an airline pilot, who is seven years younger. He&#39;s adopted, though we&#39;re still blood related - he&#39;s my cousin. My parents couldn&#39;t have any more children after me, so when Dad&#39;s brother died, they adopted John, then just a baby.</p><p>I met Gemma, my wife, when she was 12. She had a schoolgirl crush on me and her dad had arranged for her to meet me. Later, she started coming to my concerts, but I only got to know her well after her mother died. I rang to see how she was, and that&#39;s how it started.</p><p>My dad is like a cactus - introverted and tough. I&#39;m a people person, like my mom, but I got my competitiveness from my dad. He came to this country from Belarus with nothing and built a real business. He&#39;s my hero for giving me that need to run a business and for having enormous confidence in me.</p><p>I&#39;m concerned a little bit with the culture of celebrating the fundraise. My dad taught me that when you borrow money it&#39;s the worst day of your life.</p><p>You have to respect your parents. They are giving you an at-bat. If you&#39;re an entrepreneur and go into the family business, you want to grow fast. Patience is important. But respect the other party... My dad and I pulled it off because we really respect each other.</p><p>People who build family businesses are not classically trained. They have to deal with an enormous amount of politics. You think corporate politics are tough? Go work for your dad or your mom.</p><p>My parents were kind of over protective people. Me and my sister had to play in the backyard all the time. They bought us bikes for Christmas but wouldn&#39;t let us ride in the street, we had to ride in the backyard. Another Christmas, my dad got me a basketball hoop and put it in the middle of the lawn! You can&#39;t dribble on grass.</p><p>My mom grew up in poverty in Oklahoma - like Dust Bowl, nine people in one room kind of place - and the way she got out of poverty was through education. My dad grew up without a dad, with very little and he also made his way out through education.</p><p>I am lucky to have had an attentive, curious and loving dad and heart-smart, down-to-earth, gifted mother. They changed the outlooks of their own lives and have never forgotten the people and organizations that helped them dream bigger than their circumstances should have allowed.</p><p>My dad and my uncles owned a bar outside of Cincinnati. I worked there growing up, mopping floors, waiting tables.</p><p>My hat was pulled down and this girl said &#39;Are you really him?&#39; I whispered &#39;Yeah, I&#39;m really him.&#39; She screamed, &#39;Mom! Dad! It&#39;s Heath Ledger!</p><p>My dad works in child protection and he&#39;s spent many, many years in that line of work.</p><p>At one point my dad called me and said, &#39;You have always been a great salesman. I think it&#39;s time you come home and sell swimming pools.&#39;</p><p>You know, my mother&#39;s beautiful, my dad was a really handsome man, and there was a lot of talk about looks when I was growing up.</p><p>I mean, my dad&#39;s a television producer, and I knew I could get a job as an assistant or a reader with one of his friends, but it wasn&#39;t exactly what I wanted to do.</p><p>My dad had this philosophy that if you tell children they&#39;re beautiful and wonderful then they believe it, and they will be. So I never thought I was unattractive. But I was never one of the girls at school who had lots of boyfriends.</p><p>It&#39;s a complex relationship when your dad happened to be president and you are president and then you have all the amateur psychology that goes on when people try to speculate about motivations.</p><p>My guess is my brother would call his mom and his dad pretty regularly, a lot more than I probably did.</p><p>I&#39;m lucky because my dad taught me to be frugal and save. And that&#39;s important because I want to know that I don&#39;t have to take an acting job for two or three years if I don&#39;t want to and that I&#39;ll still be able to make my house and car payments and buy food for my dogs.</p><p>My mom and dad just loved the fact that I fooled around. They just embraced it. They&#39;d always kind of enjoy it, and they liked it when I made them laugh.</p><p>Often as a child you see someone with a learning disability or Down&#39;s Syndrome and my mum and dad were always very quick to explain exactly what was going on and to be in their own way inclusive and welcoming.</p><p>When I started writing, I did have some idealised notion of my dad as a writer. But I have less and less of a literary rivalry with him as I&#39;ve gone on. I certainly don&#39;t feel I need his approval, although maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m confident that I&#39;ve got it.</p><p>It was, you know, probably 80 degrees out in L.A., and my dad took me outside and there was snow. At the time, I thought, &#39;Every kid doesn&#39;t have snow in their backyard on Christmas?&#39;</p><p>I&#39;d like to play Matt Damon&#39;s daddy. He&#39;s a wonderful actor, I really admire him, and I&#39;d like to play his dad one day.</p><p>The one thing that kept our family together was the music. The only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music.</p><p>I am the granddaughter of a Welsh coal miner who was determined that his kids get out of the mines. My dad got his first job when he was six years old, in a little village in Wales called Nantyffyllon, cleaning bottles at the Colliers Arms.</p><p>It&#39;s just really making sure I am doing the best job I can do as a dad. I do think that is my No. 1 job.</p><p>My dad read the Bible ten times, and I want to do it in my lifetime. But it&#39;s definitely tough getting through.</p><p>My Dad was from Liverpool, and he picked it up in the army. He&#39;d often come out with this stuff.</p><p>My dad loved to laugh. He was very funny and very silly.</p><p>My dad sold encyclopedias and my mom worked in a factory office.</p><p>My mother always taught me, even my dad, just never let other people&#39;s opinions of you shape your opinion of yourself. And I never have and I never will.</p><p>I loved climbing because of the freedom, and having time and space. I remember coming off Everest for the last time, thinking of Dad and wishing that he could have seen what I saw. He would have loved it.</p><p>Becoming a dad means you have to be a role model for your son and be someone he can look up to.</p><p>I was lucky to have my dad in my life. As crazy as things got, I always had him to put his hand on my shoulder.</p><p>Within our culture, every school has a swimming pool. We lived on the coast. People swam in the surf. It&#39;s a very sporty nation and at that particular time anyone who had an artistic bent was very much an outsider. So if you liked reading or ideas or playing the piano then your dad viewed you as a sissy, basically.</p><p>My dad always taught me to never be satisfied, to want more and know that what is done is done.</p><p>So much of my aesthetic was formed by my dad.</p><p>My dad wanted to name me after Rainier Maria Rilke, the poet.</p><p>My dad was always such a frustrated artist. He always worked very hard to support his family, doing a bunch of ridiculous jobs. He wanted to be a painter, but then he also wrote science-fiction novels in his spare time.</p><p>The founder of the Mona Foundation actually knew my dad for years, and the more I learned about it, the more I realized I really found the perfect charity. It sponsors schools and educational initiatives all over the planet.</p><p>I had bohemian parents in Seattle in the last &#39;60s living in a houseboat. My dad wrote science fiction novels and painted big murals and oil paintings.</p><p>As a father now, I wouldn&#39;t do what my dad did, because it left me feeling emotionally unstable as a kid. But he didn&#39;t do the things he did out of selfishness or malice.</p><p>I know my dad is a big Internet freak, and he&#39;s been known to be a Wikileaker.</p><p>In a school where everyone is famous or rich or whatever, you have a culture, &#39;What does your dad do?&#39; &#39;What does your mom do?&#39;</p><p>I think &#39;Family Guy&#39; and &#39;American Dad&#39; have definitely staked out their own style and territory, and now the accusations are coming that &#39;The Simpsons&#39; is taking jokes from &#39;Family Guy.&#39; And I can tell you, that ain&#39;t the case.</p><p>I grew up in the world of bad television, on my dad&#39;s sets and then as a young schmuck on dating shows and so on.</p><p>My mum always told me I was precious, while my dad always told me I was worthless. I think that&#39;s a good grounding for a balanced life.</p><p>I used to have a silk dressing gown an uncle bought in Japan and when I came downstairs in it, my dad used to call me Davinia. There was never embarrassment about that kind of thing. My sister used to dress me up a lot. She thought I was a little doll.</p><p>I think it&#39;s easiest to teach by example. My dad didn&#39;t tell us to work hard we just saw how hard he worked. I know I have shortcomings - like a short fuse - but I&#39;ve learned you can&#39;t come home from a long day of work and snap at the kids.</p><p>I had lost relationships with my dad, my brother and sister and I was just like, you know what, this is definitely the time to just get it together and so that&#39;s what I did.</p><p>You know, I&#39;m just - I&#39;m really happy for my dad.</p><p>I had the opportunity to go to law school, and my dad, who was an accountant, couldn&#39;t believe I wanted to walk away from that and start cooking.</p><p>Now that I&#39;m a dad, I&#39;m practicing what I call &#39;one- handed cooking,&#39; because I&#39;ve got something more important in my other arm. I&#39;m whipping up lots of frittatas and omelets.</p><p>My dad has been married to his wife for 15 years and wherever he goes there better be a seat for her. I like real couples that tell you how to get through on Wednesdays when you&#39;re just at the end of your rope - the ones who really know how to make it through. We have to stop looking at Hollywood couples because you&#39;re going to get disappointed.</p><p>My sisters have been baptized and my dad is a deacon at his church now. Sadly my mother passed away but what I can say is that the Jehovah Witnesses took very good care of her up until she died.</p><p>My dad worked two jobs and moved us to the suburbs, and just being a black person, I went through a lot of racism and being called names and being bullied every single day. And it was hard. I didn&#39;t have any friends.</p><p>I listened to the radio, so I was influenced by everyone from Michael Jackson to Milli Vanilli. But thankfully my dad had a collection of Cat Stevens albums while my mom was listening to jazz.</p><p>My dad has sometimes felt that I grew up a little lacking in sufficient eccentricity - in the sense that I&#39;m willing to live as an adult in a house with walls that are parallel to each other, that sort of thing.</p><p>I was into all kinds of music as a teen - country music, because my dad was in a band that played country, and whatever my sister and brother were into.</p><p>My dad was a huge country music fan, but he also had a band and he sang. So he&#39;d listen to a lot of music and the songs that he&#39;d learn for the band were more from the male artists. So my earliest country memories were Waylon Jennings, Conway Twitty, George Jones, Johnny Paycheck even.</p><p>I never saw my dad cry. My son saw me cry. My dad never told me he loved me, and consequently I told Scott I loved him every other minute. The point is, I&#39;ll make less mistakes than my dad, my sons hopefully will make less mistakes than me, and their sons will make less mistakes than their dads.</p><p>Me and my dad are friends. We&#39;re cool. I&#39;ll never be disappointed again, because I don&#39;t expect anything anymore from him. I just let him exist, and that&#39;s how we get along.</p><p>My dad&#39;s family were pretty working class, actually.</p><p>My dad tells me that he took us to a pantomime when I was very, very small - panto being a sort of English phenomenon. There&#39;s traditionally a part of the show where they&#39;ll invite kids up on the stage to interact with the show. I was too young to remember this, but my dad says that I was running up onstage before they even asked us.</p><p>My dad liked a lot of Motown, but I didn&#39;t listen to it until my teenage years.</p><p>I love my mom and dad.</p><p>The only time I ever look good dancing is if I&#39;m next to my dad at a wedding.</p><p>Mental illness can happen to anybody. You can be a dustman, a politician, a Tesco worker... anyone. It could be your dad, your brother or your aunt.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot of research behind the scenes that you don&#39;t get to see, but I have an instinct that my dad nurtured from when I was born. I was very lucky then.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have any role models really. My best friend was a dog. My mum and dad saved a dog from the gutter and that dog was my brother before Jesse was born. Sami was his name and he was my role model.</p><p>My dad used to draw these great cartoon figures. His dream was being a cartoonist, but he never achieved it, and it kind of broke my heart. I think part of my interest in art had to do with his yearning for something he could never have.</p><p>My grandfather had two boys, my uncle had three boys, my dad had me and my two brothers, each of my brothers have had two boys. Then something happened with the chromosomal experiment and suddenly I&#39;ve got three girls.</p><p>My dad had this rock hard body and would work 12- to 13-hour days. The guys he worked with were scrap-iron guys. Nobody on that road crew had read a book in 10 years, but there was something about the way they lived I really admired.</p><p>A company that pays attention to the family unit is a successful company. We don&#39;t isolate the family. We don&#39;t make rides that say, &#39;Hey mom, dad, you go sit on the bench.&#39;</p><p>My dad was rubbish at all other aspects of his financial life, but he&#39;s pretty good at paying the rent.</p><p>I&#39;ve always taken my love of children from my father. He was a children magnet. Suddenly, having my first child hit home what my dad went through.</p><p>My memories are of my dad taking me to football on Saturday mornings, and my mum taking me swimming. Those are the things I remember from my childhood, not sitting around the table debating capitalism and the profit squeeze.</p><p>My dad was a ham, too. He could sell those women anything. Of all his sons, I was the only one he could trust to sell as well as he could. I was proud of that.</p><p>Politicians... talk in generalities and lies, and I think they&#39;ve caused all our grief. They&#39;re so awful, they&#39;re really funny. I hate thinking this because my dad loved politics.</p><p>My mom&#39;s a social worker, and my dad works in non-profit organisations.</p><p>After graduating from flares and platforms in the early 1970s, I started drama school wearing a pair of khaki dungarees with one of my Dad&#39;s Army shirts, accessorised by a cat&#39;s basket doubling as a handbag. Very Lady Gaga.</p><p>I&#39;ve just got crap hair. Although I inherited a lot of stuff from my dad, including giant knees, I didn&#39;t get his good, thick hair. I got my mother&#39;s thin, wispy, non-event hair instead.</p><p>I was into the Mets because my Dad worked at IBM where he got free Mets tickets, so I was into the Mets... then I got to &#39;Saturday Night Live&#39; where my boss has unbelievable N.Y. Yankees tickets, so he invites us to the games. I&#39;m going to all the games, so I might as well root for the team I&#39;m gonna go sit with.</p><p>I always wanted to be a stay-at-home dad making art, making movies.</p><p>In high school I dated a white woman. She would come to visit me on the rez. And her dad, who was very racist, didn&#39;t like that at all. And he told her one time, &#39;You shouldn&#39;t go on the rez if you&#39;re white because Indians have a lot of anger in their heart.&#39;</p><p>When I was a kid, my step dad started this business and would go out and get lost cows and stuff. He was part-time truck driver, farmer and cowboy. He taught me how to ride from an early age.</p><p>I haven&#39;t really decided to be an actor yet! I started doing plays when I was about 15 or 16. I only did it because my dad saw a bunch of pretty girls in a restaurant and he asked them where they came from and they said drama group. He said, &#39;Son, that is where you need to go.&#39;</p><p>My dad says he likes to bask in my glow.</p><p>I grew up with baseball I played in Little League and went to games with my dad. But I, as I grew up, became more of a basketball fanatic than a baseball one.</p><p>My mom was a professional. My dad and mom met each other in a movie called &#39;New Faces of 1937.&#39; My mom went under the name Thelma Leeds, and she did a few movies, and she was really a great singer, and when she married my dad and started to have a family, she sang at parties.</p><p>I love being a dad, it keeps me fit and inspired and children are so funny. They always supply you with acting material!</p><p>My first outdoor cooking memories are full of erratic British summers, Dad swearing at a barbecue that he couldn&#39;t put together, and eventually eating charred sausages, feeling brilliant.</p><p>I want any excuse to come home. My dad is not a spring chicken any more. If anyone says, &#39;Go buy a postage stamp in London,&#39; I&#39;ll go and do it.</p><p>We all have experiences in our lives that change us, and we all learn from people, like my dad, but at the end of the day, it&#39;s only us. And we&#39;re only responsible to make ourselves happy.</p><p>I was born in 1968, just eighteen months after my sister Chrisse and just one year after Dad passed the bar exam.</p><p>My dad was an editor and a writer, and that&#39;s actually what I aspired to be.</p><p>Baseball is the president tossing out the first ball of the season. And a scrubby schoolboy playing catch with his dad on a Mississippi farm.</p><p>I have great faith that Heaven&#39;s there and I&#39;ll see my brothers and my mom and dad when I get there.</p><p>When I was 7, my dad asked his friend to teach me. I played my first tournament competition when I was 8. I remember I shot around 125.</p><p>If a dad does his job, we don&#39;t need prisons, we don&#39;t need jails. That&#39;s what I saw growing up.</p><p>I&#39;ve become a less brave traveller since I became a dad, but in the past I was more foolhardy than brave.</p><p>My dad was working abroad, in Iraq, and he was a doctor. We used to go and visit him, in Baghdad, off and on. For the first ten years of my life, we used to go backwards and forwards to Baghdad, so that was quite amazing. I spent a lot of time traveling around the Middle East.</p><p>I stayed in Baghdad every summer until I was 14. My dad&#39;s sister is still there, but many of my relatives have managed to get out. People forget that there are still people there who are not radicalized in any particular direction, trying to live normal lives in a very difficult situation.</p><p>My mom and dad got divorced when I was very young, and growing up in a family where the head of the household wasn&#39;t a man made a big difference.</p><p>I was always the new kid in school, I&#39;m the kid from a broken family, I&#39;m the kid who had no dad showing up at the father-son stuff, I&#39;m the kid that was using food stamps at the grocery store.</p><p>My dad had a personal style which was very attractive. It was quite reserved and quite elegant, and it was infectious.</p><p>Every kid needs to say, &#39;I want what my mom and dad have.&#39;</p><p>In my case, I was born to parents who were very young, and I don&#39;t think they were entirely ready to have a child. My dad was going to college and working two or three jobs at the same time, and my mum was working and going to school.</p><p>My dad was an absentee dad, so it was always important to me that I was part of my daughter&#39;s life, and she deserved two parents, which is part of the rationale behind us staying married for 30 years.</p><p>My senior year of high school, when I was getting recruited for college, my dad goes to me, &#39;You can become an Olympic champion.&#39; And that&#39;s the first time that I&#39;d heard someone else say that to me. I was like, &#39;Uh, are you talking to me?&#39;</p><p>The worst advice I ever received from my dad was to play by the book.</p><p>The only time I think about life beyond F1 is when I contemplate becoming a dad. But there&#39;s no way that&#39;s going to happen while I&#39;m still racing. To be successful in F1 you need to be very selfish in lots of ways and you&#39;re away from home for long periods. That&#39;s not the kind of father I want to be.</p><p>But you know, my dad called me the laziest white kid he ever met. When I screamed back at him that he was putting down a race of people to call me lazy, his answer was that&#39;s not what he was doing, and that I was also the dumbest white kid he ever met.</p><p>My dad said: &#39;It looks like you&#39;ll be world No.1 in a few hours and I wanted to be the first to say congratulations.&#39;</p><p>Dad sometimes patted me on the knee and called me his Little Schmuck.</p><p>I had never said, &#39;dad, I love you.&#39;</p><p>My dad dragged me to a Bruce Springsteen concert as a kid. It was my first concert, but I fell asleep in the middle. My second concert was Weezer on the &#39;Pinkerton&#39; tour, and &#39;Pinkerton&#39; is the reason why I&#39;m doing this.</p><p>I came from somewhat of a musical family. I had an uncle on Broadway. My dad kind of knows how to play instruments. Although, I always find it annoying when he does play an instrument.</p><p>I grew up in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood, but my mom is Filipino-Spanish and my dad is Irish.</p><p>The moment my doctor told me, I went silent. My mum and dad were with me, then we all went to pieces. I was saying, No, I&#39;ve got my flight to Sydney in two hours. I&#39;m getting on a plane.</p><p>I grew up in Texas, and people love their American-made muscle cars there. I grew up around people who loved cars and took care of cars and my dad&#39;s a big car nut, so I learned a little bit about cars - how to love them, most importantly. I think that from the time I could remember, I&#39;ve always envisioned myself in a vintage muscle car.</p><p>When I used to do musical theatre, my dad refused to come backstage. He never wanted to see the props up close or the sets up close. He didn&#39;t want to see the magic.</p><p>My mother&#39;s a psychologist, my stepfather&#39;s a psychologist, my stepmother is a therapist and my dad&#39;s a lawyer. So it was all prominent in my life. I don&#39;t know anyone who doesn&#39;t know someone on some form of prescription medicine.</p><p>As a kid who wasn&#39;t into sports, at school I felt almost alienated at times, whereas in the theatre community there was this amazing sense of camaraderie. Early on, we would go to rehearsals with my dad and I was like the mascot for the backstage crew. That was a big part of my childhood, so I dreamed of one day doing a play in London.</p><p>It was tough at the time but when I was younger, my Dad. I would say my Dad, because without him I wouldn&#39;t have been here. I mean it was tough for me because he was really demanding. With him, it was never enough, you know, anything I did was never enough.</p><p>My dad said, &#39;The thing that I was told that was really helpful was that I mustn&#39;t be afraid of the things I was afraid of when I was five years old&#39;. The shock of his childhood had put him in this defensive crouch against the world, and he needed to know that he had a nice wife and kids and it wasn&#39;t the same any more.</p><p>When I was growing up my mother would say, &#39;Your dad may have to learn about being a father because he lost his own and that would have affected him&#39;.</p><p>I feel connected to the Second World War because my father lost his father in that war. So, through my dad and the effect it had on him of losing his father young, I always felt connected to the war. It goes back years, but it still feels to me as if we&#39;re completely living in it.</p><p>I&#39;m a military kid, both parents in the military - Mom did 12 years, Dad did 21, served in two wars. So discipline is something that was huge.</p><p>One thing my dad always told me, was he would make sure I always had what he didn&#39;t have. He couldn&#39;t play basketball because he didn&#39;t have tennis shoes - so I had five pairs of tennis shoes.</p><p>You always give credit where credit is due - to high school coaches, college coaches - but my dad, the foundation that he built with me, is where all of this came from. The speed, the determination, the mindset, just the natural belief that you can do anything you put your mind to, it all comes from my dad.</p><p>I don&#39;t know much about only children. I was the middle one of three, and if ever I was alone with mum and dad, it was a rare moment.</p><p>I think in my case, I had no choice but to have a good sense of humor. I grew up with my dad, Danny Thomas, and George Burns and Bob Hope and Milton Berle and Sid Caesar and all those guys were at our house all the time and telling jokes and making each other laugh.</p><p>Dad taught us about morals, values and goals. Having a tight-knit family was important to him.</p><p>I wanted to perform well for my mom and dad, because in high school, I didn&#39;t have a job. My brothers, they worked at Pizza Hut or places like that, but sports, that was my way of giving back.</p><p>The only ones I trust really are my Mum and Dad and those who are closest to me.</p><p>My dad said if you become a tennis professional just make sure you get into the top hundred, because you have to make a little bit of money. You make a living so you can pay your coaching and, you know, your travels.</p><p>Money stress is what used to remind me of my Dad most.</p><p>My dad was the manager at the 45,000-acre ranch, but he owned his own 1,200-acre ranch, and I owned four cattle that he gave to me when I graduated from grammar school, from the eighth grade. And those cows multiplied, and he kept track of them for years for me. And that was my herd.</p><p>My dad&#39;s not here, but he&#39;s watching in heaven.</p><p>My dad was a diplomat and after living in America, where I was born, he was posted to Cairo.</p><p>My dad was depressed a lot of the time, and there were a lot of things in his life that he never resolved.</p><p>I&#39;d love to be a dad. I hope I&#39;d be great at it. That&#39;s every man&#39;s fear, yet his most important job.</p><p>My parents divorced when I was young but I was brought up in two really loving households. I didn&#39;t have a contentious relationship with my mom or dad.</p><p>I come from an ordinary family - my dad is a carpenter, a roof-maker - and we&#39;ve always loved racing together.</p><p>When dad told me Mr Steptoe had passed away, I broke down.</p><p>Both my mum and dad were great readers, and we would go every Saturday morning to the library, and my sister and I had a library card when we could pass off something as a signature, and all of us would come with an armful of books.</p><p>I knew I was going to be a journalist when I was eight years old and I saw the printing presses rolling at the Sydney newspaper where my dad worked as a proofreader.</p><p>My dad&#39;s a scratch golfer and I&#39;ve got the knack of seeing something and then replicating it. I saw my dad swing a club and I worked out how to do the same thing. My backswing and follow-through have been basically the same since I was two.</p><p>My mom and dad worked very hard to give me the best chance in - not just in golf but in life. You know, I was an only child, you know, my dad worked three jobs at one stage. My mom worked night shifts in a factory.</p><p>I wanted to make a point of basing myself at home, being close to my family. I&#39;ll never be able to repay Mum and Dad for what they did, but at least they know they&#39;ll never have to work another day. I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to look after them.</p><p>Dad and mom would have preferred that I be a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist, or a great humanitarian.</p><p>My dad and I played music. He teaches me a song or two every time I&#39;m home.</p><p>Although my dad was a doctor, we weren&#39;t necessarily a super-artsy family. We were just a classic, traditional family who got to take a lot of piano lessons and became a bunch of musicians.</p><p>I&#39;m the fun dad, I am also the disciplinarian.</p><p>You know my dad pushed me to believe that I was going to be the best. I just never thought of life without tennis, even looking forward.</p><p>My dad was this sort of avant-garde guy who did all kinds of weird things. He was a true original and anybody who met him never forgot him.</p><p>I&#39;m into being a dad, that&#39;s where my focus is most of the time. I&#39;m an actor that&#39;s my job, but it&#39;s not my life. I have a lot of other interests too.</p><p>We busted a lot of family secrets with this. But to make a long story short, my parents relationship was built heavily on security issues for my Mom, and when my Dad couldn&#39;t provide security, the relationship unraveled.</p><p>My dad taught me to play bass. He&#39;s a bass player he still plays in a band in Michigan to this day. He taught me to play bass when I was about 6. I used to just go to band practice with him, and whoever didn&#39;t show up for rehearsal that day, I would take their spot.</p><p>My dad calls me &#39;Mac&#39; a lot, from &#39;Mike Tyson&#39;s Punch Out&#39; - Little Mac is the main character. I was obsessed. I can still beat Mike Tyson on &#39;Punch Out.&#39;</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had a holiday in my entire life that wasn&#39;t about my dad&#39;s work.</p><p>I want to stay healthy, keep fit, eat well, keep a low profile and be a good dad.</p><p>OK, so my parents were married in 1955 and my mom knew my dad was gay and my dad knew he was gay and so I was, like, &#39;Why in the heck did you get married?&#39; Like, what was going on? What was that time? It&#39;s like this crazy paradox that my whole life is based on, or my family&#39;s based on. So I spent a lot of time trying to understand &#39;55.</p><p>My dad&#39;s gay experiences really had a very positive influence on me and my straight relationships - how to better accept all the weirdness and ambiguity and ups and downs and paradoxes. I knew from the beginning I was writing about love.</p><p>I think my dad is the only Arabic descendent who is an unsuccessful businessman.</p><p>When my father died in my arms it had such a profound affect on me that at that very moment when my dad passed I realized that I needed to face my own fears.</p><p>I had an amazing childhood, lots of love. But my dad worked his tail off, getting up at 4 in the morning and going off at 5, 6 o&#39;clock, yet he always had time to spend with his kids and his wife.</p><p>When I was a boy, I used to pull a big cross saw with my dad. He&#39;d use his right hand, so I&#39;d have to use my left.</p><p>I&#39;ve got a really great family round me, two sisters and an older brother and my mum and dad. Everybody&#39;s equal.</p><p>My mum was raised Jewish, my dad is very scientifically minded, and my school was vaguely Christian. We sang hymns in school. I liked the hymns bit, but apart from that, I can take it or leave it. So I had lots of different influences when I was younger.</p><p>My dad is a doctor, a professor of psychiatry, and my mum is a psychotherapist.</p><p>I often talk with other actors about that time when you&#39;ve just finished a job, because I think you do take on the characteristics of some of the characters you play. Sometimes it can be a great thing and sometimes it&#39;s a bit haunting because you&#39;re not quite sure how to leave it on set. My dad talks about it as being &#39;de-personalised.&#39;</p><p>My dad was a Marine. He was one of the Montford Point Marines. Those are the equivalent of the Tuskegee Airmen for Marines. He&#39;s a tough, tough guy. When I was 15 we had a fight, and I didn&#39;t speak to him for 10 years.</p><p>My mom and my dad were married 56 years, and the fact that I reconciled with my dad I think made their marriage a little bit better as well.</p><p>If anybody had a reason to become a delinquent, to become a criminal, to be angry at the man, to be angry at the white man, to be angry at America, it&#39;s my dad, but he did not feel that way at all.</p><p>My dad? He died when I was 19, which is a bad time for your dad to die, because there&#39;s an awful lot of things you have to resolve with your parents past your teens if you&#39;ve been a difficult teenager.</p><p>More and more couples are having this negotiation or discussion, but I&#39;m still amazed at the number who aren&#39;t and where the cultural norm sort of kicks in and they just assume that mom&#39;s got to be the one who stays home, not dad.</p><p>My parents moved to American Samoa when I was three or four years old. My dad was principal of a high school there. It was idyllic for a kid. I had a whole island for a backyard. I lived there until I was eight years old and we moved to Santa Barbara.</p><p>Parents don&#39;t understand kids and kids don&#39;t understand parents. My parents were divorced when I was really young and I went to live with my dad.</p><p>My grandfather was a lawyer, my dad was a lawyer, my mum was a lawyer, I got an uncle who&#39;s a lawyer, I got cousins that are lawyers.</p><p>I pop gum. My parents get so annoyed with me. I know my dad wishes he never taught me how to do that.</p><p>My dad is a nurse midwife, one of about only 50 male midwives in the U.S., I think.</p><p>I&#39;m the most inappropriate dad. I curse in front of my kids and their friends. I let my kids watch R-rated movies. I&#39;ll walk by the movie theater and say, &#39;Let&#39;s go see that,&#39; and my kids will say, &#39;No, it&#39;s rated R. It&#39;s not appropriate for kids.&#39; I&#39;m like Uncle Dad. We have fun. I don&#39;t live with them, but I drive over four days a week.</p><p>I think I had kind of an advantage. When I was growing up, my dad had just got out of jail and he had a great record collection. He had - it was all - these were the songs. So I heard a lot of these songs, like, my whole life, so for me it was easy. I already knew what I was going to sing.</p><p>My mom and dad played this music all the time when I was growing up, so to me songs by Jerry Lee and Fats Domino are the classics, they&#39;re the best songs ever.</p><p>I can definitely tell when mum has got money because then she likes to go shopping to spend it, whereas dad is steadier and avoids splurges. I like to think I&#39;ve inherited both sides.</p><p>You know not having my real dad around and having a step dad made me want to be a great dad. So now I have been one for 9 years. And now 3 daughters. So, that is what I am - a dad, first and foremost, before anything else. It&#39;s just something that comes natural now.</p><p>My dad has been a big influence on me, because he&#39;s always had his own business. He really taught me business sense and how to be a focused individual, but also how to have fun and make everyone around you have fun.</p><p>I love to cook. My dad&#39;s a really excellent cook and his style is: Look in the fridge and make whatever there is with whatever ingredients you have and I like cooking like that, too.</p><p>I could not tell you the date of my mother&#39;s death. I could not tell you the date of my dad&#39;s death. These are not dates that I find significant.</p><p>My Dad hated his job. He sold overcoats, but he wanted to make movies. He had a failed career working with the Ritz Brothers - they were like the Marx Brothers, only a tier below. I always had a picture in my mind of him in a straw hat.</p><p>People who have not done their research on me do not know that I am European, born in Copenhagen, Denmark to an Italian father from Napoli and a mother from Alabama who was singing opera and went to Europe, met my dad, fell in love, and then moved back to Rome, where I was raised, between Rome and Hamburg.</p><p>I have always had the feeling I could do anything and my dad told me I could. I was in college before I found out he might be wrong.</p><p>It&#39;s not like he called me up and asked me. They&#39;ve never wanted to throw us into that world, and I think our decision probably shocked them. But I love my dad, and I think I&#39;d regret it if I didn&#39;t do this.</p><p>My dad saw my husband&#39;s boss at a conference, and he said to stop paying my husband until we produce children.</p><p>I&#39;m more like my father, personality-wise. But my mom and I get alone really well - obviously, because my mom and my dad get along so well.</p><p>I&#39;m sure there were times when I wish I had thought, &#39;Gosh, that might really embarrass mom and dad,&#39; but our parents didn&#39;t raise us to think about them. They&#39;re very selfless and they wanted us to have as normal of a college life as possible. So really, we didn&#39;t think of any repercussions.</p><p>In the &#39;Garnethill&#39; trilogy, people always forget that Maureen O&#39;Donnell&#39;s dad was a journalist and she did art history at uni and her brother did law, but no-one ever thinks they&#39;re middle-class - they&#39;re just working class because they speak with accents.</p><p>There&#39;s been times when I&#39;ve had heartbreaking moments and I&#39;m like, &#39;I can&#39;t believe you said that,&#39; or &#39;I can&#39;t believe you did that&#39;. And it hurts, it still hurts, and it&#39;ll always hurt, but I&#39;ve never had somebody that I truly cared about just walk out on me, whether it was a boyfriend, or an aunt, mom or dad.</p><p>My parents were involved in everything I did. They were showbiz people themselves. My dad was an actor. They were parents they did what parents are supposed to do.</p><p>I remember my dad working with me on breaking down my script and writing out a back story for my character and all that stuff.</p><p>I grew up in a small town in Illinois, and my dad was a basketball coach. Thanks to him, I have excellent fundamentals in both basketball and baseball.</p><p>I went to my dad when I was 17 and said, &#39;I want to be a country music star.&#39; Which every dad loves to hear. And he said, &#39;I want you to go to college.&#39; So we had a discussion. And I&#39;m pretty stubborn. I&#39;m a lot like him. And he said, &#39;If you go to college and graduate, I&#39;ll pay your first six months of rent in Nashville.&#39; So he bribed me.</p><p>That is where the irony of the film comes off, in terms of the language it employs - where he tries desperately to be a &#39;TV Dad,&#39; to give advice and it&#39;s so pat it becomes ridiculous.</p><p>My dad is a bank president and my mom was an accountant and they didn&#39;t think that seeking the life of a freelance writer was very practical, you see. Of course, I was just as determined to do it.</p><p>I&#39;m going to take care of the man I&#39;m with. I grew up in a household where my mum takes care of my dad - she cooks, she does everything - and that&#39;s the kind of girl I am.</p><p>My dad came out of the Roosevelt era and the Depression. One person and one party made a difference in his life. That&#39;s what everybody forgot when they called my father and other people political bosses.</p><p>I have found having my dad as my North Star has worked well for me.</p><p>I just went off for two months traveling around Europe on a motorcycle and pretty much turned my phone off. I did 5,000 miles with my dad. We went through Holland, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Italy... and then I did Spain and France by myself.</p><p>My mom&#39;s been married three times my dad has been married a lot. I didn&#39;t really see my dad that much.</p><p>I think I&#39;m extremely vulnerable and that in some ways I seek out rejection. Never feeling like you&#39;re getting that pat on the back from dad is probably at the heart of that.</p><p>My dad is a very quick-witted, sarcastic, dry, humorous guy, whereas my mom&#39;s very silly, and that side of the family is very musical.</p><p>My dad, of course, like a lot of Asian parents, wanted me to be an engineer or doctor and never could understand why I would want to be a lawyer. And then, when I first said I wanted to run for office, he thought that was absolutely insane.</p><p>I know exactly where I&#39;ve come from, I know exactly who my mum and dad are.</p><p>I remember opening my dad&#39;s closet and there were, like, 40 suits, every color of the rainbow, plaid and winter and summer. He had two jewelry boxes full of watches and lighters and cuff links. And just... he was that guy. He was probably unfulfilled in his life in many ways.</p><p>My dad used to flush my mother&#39;s head down the toilet. I was so screwed up.</p><p>My dad&#39;s passion was to teach adults to read so they could read to their kids.</p><p>My dad knows how to tell a story. He&#39;d make me laugh by doing all the different voices.</p><p>My dad came from Cuba when he was a teenager not speaking English. And I grew up here speaking Spanglish. That&#39;s the world in which I grew up, and that&#39;s a world in which a lot of second generation immigrants find themselves.</p><p>A large part of my life revolves around my dad. Sometimes, I even feel a strong sense of connection, something very tangible when I learn something new in the martial arts.</p><p>My dad, Donald, was a vet and had a practice in Yorkshire. Cats and dogs were his bread and butter, but his greatest love was large animals.</p><p>Like my dad, I have a Christmas party most years. I like to celebrate and see as many people as possible.</p><p>My dad doesn&#39;t get any of my jokes. He laughs at them, but he doesn&#39;t understand them. He&#39;s just laughing because people around him are laughing.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to have my own thing, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s even possible. I didn&#39;t realize so many people actually think I&#39;m trying to be like my dad. I read comments like &#39;She&#39;s no Elvis.&#39; I&#39;m not trying to be. I never set out to be.</p><p>My mum and dad had worked incredibly hard to afford me an education.</p><p>One day my dad would say, &#39;OK, if you want to play tennis I can help you out.&#39; And that&#39;s how it started. And I had a goal. I wanted to beat my mom first. And my parents and my brother. And that was the ultimate goal.</p><p>My dad has always been my coach. And I&#39;ve spent so much time with him. So he&#39;s one of my best friends. And I can talk to him about everything.</p><p>Our last jam session was this past Christmas. Dad played his harmonica, mom sang in English and Italian, and I played guitar. I&#39;m so happy that we could share that musical experience for one last time.</p><p>My dad&#39;s sense of humor was direct and sometimes surreal - his quick wit is well known amongst our family and friends. He raised me on Spike Jones records and W.C. Fields movies, and his sense of humor fell somewhere in between.</p><p>Jenna&#39;s traveled with me they&#39;ve both traveled with their dad. This is the only time they&#39;ve been old enough in all of their dad&#39;s campaigns to really be involved in.</p><p>My dad remembers being in school with my uncle, and the teacher would say outright to the class that the Japanese were second-class citizens and shouldn&#39;t be trusted.</p><p>Listen, everything I did in my childhood was competitive. Everything we did my dad made it into a game to win. We used to drive my mum nuts.</p><p>The satisfaction you get when you finally beat your dad is amazing, that rush of adrenaline.</p><p>I think he would have been proud and smiling... when we laid him to rest because his family was together. I think that was a great gift to be able to give Dad at the end.</p><p>You know my father as governor, as president, but I knew him as dad. I was so proud to have the Reagan name and to be Ronald Reagan&#39;s son.</p><p>I remember once, we got an interview, and he said, &#39;Dad, these people are writing about me like I&#39;m an adult. Don&#39;t they know I&#39;m a kid?&#39; I have never tried to encourage him to get a music image like other musicians have.</p><p>I didn&#39;t always want to be a dad.</p><p>My dad used to love Steely Dan, the Stones, Jethro Tull and all that. There was always Steely Dan going in my dad&#39;s car, but I remember The Royal Scam in particular because it has &#39;Kid Charlemagne&#39; on it.</p><p>Growing up, I didn&#39;t give my grandfather&#39;s photography a second thought. I wasn&#39;t involved in his work, except that I helped my dad print his negatives.</p><p>I didn&#39;t want to travel. I didn&#39;t want to leave my family. I heard all these stories from Dad about not having Edward around when he was young, and I didn&#39;t want that to happen.</p><p>My dad took me to all the best rock and punk shows when I was growing up and music has always been a part of my life. So I&#39;m very interested in the music scene and I suppose that&#39;s why I&#39;ve ended up going out with musicians. Dave Pirner is still one of my best friends.</p><p>My parents are very hard working people who did everything they could for their children. I have two brothers and they worked dog hard to give us an education and provide us with the most comfortable life possible. My dad provided for his family daily. So, yes, that is definitely in my DNA.</p><p>When my dad needed a shirt ironed, he would yell downstairs to my mother, who would drop everything and iron his shirt.</p><p>My dad was kind of a pool shark and had a Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin thing going on. I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the fifties because of him. There was a hip, cool, anything-goes atmosphere back then, but looking good was still a priority.</p><p>My dad had emphysema and both of my parents had chronic bronchitis and ended up with cancers - all smoking related.</p><p>Dad made it to Gold Shield Detective, so he always busted Robin, my oldest brother, and me. Always got caught, whatever we were doing.</p><p>I am blessed to have Mom and Dad.</p><p>My dad told us up front, &#39;Guys, if you want to play sports, go ahead, but it&#39;s your decision.&#39;</p><p>As a dad I&#39;m emotionally dedicated but I&#39;m not &#39;figuring out their life plans&#39;. But of course as I&#39;m telling them about the rights of wrongs I&#39;m thinking back to what I was like at their age.</p><p>When I was on Broadway when I was little, I remember always driving through Times Square with my dad to the theater. Now when I go back, you can&#39;t even drive on Broadway in the 40s. New Times Square is too touristy to me.</p><p>I had my heart set on becoming an English teacher, but stumbled into acting after meeting a theatrical agent in my dad&#39;s restaurant in San Diego.</p><p>The Rat Pack was the piece that really kicked me out of that little funk that I was in and then Ted called me up and asked me if I wanted to be the dad in Blow.</p><p>Dad was just an emotional wreck. He was drinking a lot of the time, he was smoking a lot of pot. And because he takes certain medications, the drinking was making him... you know, he wasn&#39;t even present, really.</p><p>If I have a problem, stuff&#39;s going through my head, I feel like using, I usually go and talk to my dad... I decided to get sober a lot younger than he did. He first tried to get sober when he was like 32, I believe.</p><p>And then before going back for my sophomore year, I decided to change my major to arts and sciences, and my dad cut a deal with me: He said if I&#39;d quit school he&#39;d pay my rent for the next three years, as if I were in school.</p><p>I was born and brought up in Liverpool with my clever little sister Jemma, who is 14 and wants to be a vet. My mum Jane is an administrator and my dad Peter is a taxi driver.</p><p>Dad worked in a warehouse when I was little and I didn&#39;t see him for three years as he was doing all the overtime God gave him to buy me new ballet shoes, or a new tutu.</p><p>People say I&#39;m not good at writing about men. My dad left when I was 16. Give me a break. I&#39;m doing the best I can.</p><p>My dad loved black singers. So listening to New Orleans music, eventually I wanted to play an instrument.</p><p>Dad was a very gentle, sweet man.</p><p>I had to learn how to chop wood actually - I don&#39;t think my dad would have let me go chop wood in the backyard growing up.</p><p>It is because my dad died suddenly that I became an actor. I thought, I&#39;m going to make money doing this thing I enjoy.</p><p>Growing up, I saw my dad do charity work for children with health issues. That had a profound effect on me.</p><p>I&#39;m looking out for myself, but I&#39;m looking out for my dad, too.</p><p>I know I&#39;m 25 now, but there&#39;s still that little lad inside me who likes his dad there to see him.</p><p>My dad knows the business, and he tells me I&#39;ve got to do what&#39;s best for me.</p><p>Although my dad Harry is the manager of West Ham, we get on very well.</p><p>At 18, I guarded the parking lot at the Catholic church bingos. Now my dad made sure I could take care of myself. I carried a Smith and Wesson 357 magnum.</p><p>My dad was a golden gloves boxer in the Marine Corps, then a deputy sheriff. My mom worked as an office assistant.</p><p>Comedy was why I got into acting the first place. Peter Sellers was a huge influence on my wanting to act. I grew up with him and found him hysterical. The Pink Panther films were an inspiration, from my earliest childhood days, when I was watching them with my brother and my dad.</p><p>I remember once giving my dad some drawings and writings and said, &#39;If you could just give these to the publisher, that would be great.&#39; And I was about five!</p><p>My dad was an engineer, and he became the CEO of Chevron. His was an engineer&#39;s mind-set: Everything&#39;s kind of a problem how do you approach the problem?</p><p>My dad was a carpenter and I would work with him during the summer and umpire on the nights I wasn&#39;t playing.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t be a cameraman or a designer or an actor - I have to be a director because I learned how to do that from my dad.</p><p>My mom and dad met at UCLA when he as a captain in the Air Force and she was in her junior year.</p><p>My dad instilled in me a great sense of humor. I wasn&#39;t bullied at school because my outward attitude was confident, and that helps.</p><p>When I was born in 1970 with a rare genetic disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SED), medical science wasn&#39;t what it is today and my mum and dad were treated terribly by the medical profession.</p><p>My dad left when I was 3 1/2, and he left my mom and I.</p><p>As a father, I do everything my dad didn&#39;t do. My son Beau&#39;s birth changed my life.</p><p>I found myself very lost after &#39;The Partridge Family,&#39; and I lost my dad and I lost my manager, and I lived in a bubble, and it took me 15 years to get through that and a lot of psychotherapy, and I&#39;m laughing about it now!</p><p>I came up poor. My mother only had a fourth-grade education. My dad didn&#39;t have any education at all. But they were very structured. They worked hard. You know, they didn&#39;t complain. They didn&#39;t murmur. And they believe in the Christ.</p><p>Well, for one thing, you know my dad was a cop.</p><p>My dad used to say to me, &#39;You look more like me than I do.&#39;</p><p>I did rebel. I was the rebel in my family, because my dad wanted me to go and just travel with him.</p><p>The music I want to hear in my head sounds somewhere between Jimi Hendrix and Massive Attack. It&#39;s not really like my dad, but there will always be similarities because we have the same vocal cords, and I learnt the guitar the way he taught me.</p><p>I don&#39;t really plan to be a pop star I just want to be able to make music without the whole My Dad thing hanging over me, which everyone in my position goes through.</p><p>You can&#39; t help being a musician because you&#39;ve grown up with music, yet being one means being compared to your dad and being slated for it. But I really don&#39;t have the ambitions of most people going into the industry.</p><p>Keep your head down at school.&#39; Those are sage words from my dad. They kept me in check for years.;Dhani Harrison;dad 12754;Playing music has always felt very natural. You know, you do try to do other things, and you do learn lessons that way, but, eventually - well... if your dad is a plumber, you become a plumber. It&#39;s the family business, and I felt like I was taking over the family business.;Dhani Harrison;dad 12755;I never really saw my dad around when the Iron Maiden and the AC/DC were playing. But he knew what I was doing. I was just absorbing music. So he just kind of left me to my own devices.;Dhani Harrison;dad 12756;I did Albert Hall, I got to play the Hall of Fame with Prince. So I&#39;ve done that kind of stuff for ages. It wasn&#39;t until after we finished working on Brainwash, my dad&#39;s album after he died, then it was like &#39;That phase is over in my life now, now we can get on with our music, with our band.</p><p>When my dad toured in &#39;91, I think my first gig properly was the Tokyo Dome, 50,000 people indoors. That was pretty scary. I was 12, or 13.</p><p>I was recording stuff with my dad when I was like five, six years old. I played with him on tour. I&#39;d gone with him to Japan in &#39;91, played some gigs, did a couple shows at the Albert Hall.</p><p>My dad lived till he was 78, my mum was in her 80s, and I&#39;ve got two uncles who are in their 90s now.</p><p>My dad was a sports writer when I was younger and then he became just a general columnist. But I grew up with him literally getting into brawls with football coaches.</p><p>My dad was a musician and I traveled around with him, so it was something that I knew.</p><p>As a brother and sister, our tastes were pretty different growing up. He liked a lot of early hip hop. My dad didn&#39;t understand it and would try to talk him out of it.</p><p>My dad was quiet, angry, shut down. So my thing is: I express everything that&#39;s there. I want to get it all out.</p><p>I owe a lot to my dad, just for having provided the wrestling business for us to get into.</p><p>There was a bit of a comparison that Bret was making between Vince McMahon and my dad. He looked up to Vince as a dad and stuff, and it was a shame to see the whole thing end the way it did.</p><p>My dad was a big believer in treating people well, oftentimes even when he himself wasn&#39;t well.</p><p>And what is a stage dad, or a stage mom? It&#39;s someone who&#39;s protective. That&#39;s all.</p><p>My dad&#39;s half-Lebanese, my mom is full Lebanese. I&#39;m three-quarters Lebanese. Irish-Lebanese.</p><p>Most young people haven&#39;t used their storytelling skills since they were 8 or 9 or 10 and wanted to persuade Mom and Dad to take them to the ball game.</p><p>My dad always told me that the best way to get somebody to get at you is to talk bad about them to somebody else.</p><p>My dad always told me that anyone&#39;s voice is just another instrument added to the music.</p><p>David and Dad didn&#39;t get along too well growing up. I mean we all got along, but it was harder on David, because David wasn&#39;t going to be the son that Dad wanted. But now they&#39;re like best friends.</p><p>Mom and Dad would stay in bed on Sunday morning, but the kids would have to go to church.</p><p>I wanted my children to have the same exposure to the water I had. My strongest memories of Northeast Harbor are going in a small Whaler with my dad, looking for osprey.</p><p>My dad was a musician, it was just what he did, like another guy&#39;s dad drives a meat truck. Our house was normal. We weren&#39;t taken with the fact our dad was a musician.</p><p>My dad has a really great record collection that basically went up to the year I was born: 1984.</p><p>My dad grew up in a working-class Jewish neighbourhood, and I got a scholarship from my dad&#39;s union to go to college. I went there to get an education, not as an extension of privilege.</p><p>My dad was a musician. He was a singer and he played the guitar, so music was always around.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to be a dad.</p><p>My first memory of the Rolling Stones is listening to &#39;Satisfaction&#39; at a sixth-grade slumber party at a friend&#39;s house in Ankara, Turkey, where my family was living at the time. In the middle of our sleepover, my friend&#39;s dad stopped the record when he heard the words &#39;girlie action!&#39;</p><p>My dad used to say, &#39;You have to become part of the machine to beat the machine,&#39; and there&#39;s some validity in it. But honestly, even when I&#39;m inside the machine, you still see me. I stick out a little bit.</p><p>Your kids can say some cruel things to you at times. For example, Nicole, Miles and Sofie are standing there in the room and I&#39;m dressed to kill in my own mind. They&#39;ll say to me, &#39;Dad, you&#39;re not going out there looking like that are you?&#39; If that doesn&#39;t kill a star, I don&#39;t know what does!</p><p>I am an obsessive garage cleaner - my wife and the neighbors make fun of me. I remember that my father was the same way, and now when I&#39;m out there unearthing things in the garage, I realize I am becoming my dad!</p><p>Keep in my mind my dad didn&#39;t become a huge, huge mega actor until I was halfway through high school - so right around the time he&#39;s going through his big renaissance is right when I&#39;m starting to do my high school revolting.</p><p>My dad has always been extremely supportive in every decision I&#39;ve made and much more interested in me picking what I wanted to do.</p><p>I knew that I needed to do something that I desperately loved. There was a period where I did question if it was acting because I knew that I would be making things hard on myself. I knew that there was going to be a little bit of a hullabaloo because of my dad being who he is and all that.</p><p>When I was younger it was - you know, my dad dressed up in drag on &#39;Bosom Buddies.&#39; And that was what I was having to deal with at the time. And then around the time that I was into college was when he became statue-worthy I guess you could say.</p><p>This is like my dad&#39;s race team where we had one Legend car. If we wrecked it, we couldn&#39;t race the next week unless we had enough parts to put it back together again.</p><p>Before, I guess, mum and dad were everything, but now, in my case, I had two new girls and all of a sudden they&#39;re completely dependent on you and there&#39;s a third generation. It&#39;s a funny shift all of a sudden. You have the babies, you have yourself and then you have your parents.</p><p>I was just a kid and I didn&#39;t have a dad. That&#39;s hard, because when you&#39;re a kid, you blame yourself for everything. And I blamed myself for him not being around, for my parents not being together.</p><p>You can tell your uncle stuff that you could not tell your dad. That is kind of the role of an uncle. I feel very much like a father sometimes but sometimes I feel like a teammate.</p><p>Whenever I&#39;m in theatre situations I will go out of my way not to talk about my father, but in the film world I can be really proud of my family and say, &#39;You know what: my dad&#39;s a really, really famous theatre director,&#39; because nobody has any idea.</p><p>My dad was great. He was very droll, very dry.</p><p>A lot of times I would go into a room and audition for whatever sitcom it was and they would expect me to do sort of what my dad was doing and I am not him so they would be disappointed and I would feel nervous and not know exactly how to do it.</p><p>Even if I tried to be my dad, it would be a mediocre, slightly embarrassing version.</p><p>I knew I really made it when my dad saw me in London and after the performance he had no notes to me and just said &#39;You are doing your own thing and I am proud of you.&#39;</p><p>And my dad wanted me to play the trumpet because that&#39;s what he liked. His idol was Louis Armstrong. My dad thought my teeth came together in a way that was perfect for playing the trumpet.</p><p>Now, guitar was pretty cool. Everybody knew something on the guitar. So I wanted to play guitar, but I told my dad if he wanted me to keep studying something, I&#39;d like to study piano.</p><p>I grew up in Greenwich Village. Dad was friends with John Lennon and Yoko Ono.</p><p>I think there&#39;s nothing better than laughing in life, so that&#39;s nice, to be thought of as someone who can make someone laugh. It&#39;s &#39;cause I think life is hard. You know, my dad was a really silly man. A great Irish silly man. And that&#39;s fine.</p><p>I&#39;m a dad and that&#39;s pretty important.</p><p>My dad was a football player - a soccer player - for Manchester United, and I loved playing football, but I also happened to be the guy in class who was pretty good at sight reading. My teacher gave me scripts, and I was very comfortable.</p><p>Well, Steve Vai joined my dad&#39;s band right around the time when I actually started playing guitar. So he gave me a couple of lessons on fundamentals, and gave me some scales and practice things to work on. But I pretty much learned everything by ear.</p><p>And, you know, my dad would show me some things sometimes, but the best things that I got to do were to actually see really good players play up close. That gives you an idea of fingering and technique and what not.</p><p>I liked a lot of the things other people liked - Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Van Halen, AC/DC - but if I compared it to my dad&#39;s music, there just seemed to be elements missing.</p><p>I didn&#39;t really hear any other music other than what my dad was working on until I was 12. My recollection of hearing other music was that I liked some things that I heard but I always thought, &#39;Where&#39;s the rest of it?&#39; It didn&#39;t have the same amount of detail or instrumentation or imagination in the arrangements.</p><p>My dad taught me to be a leader or a follower, and he said follower ain&#39;t fun. So I want to be the leader of Bubba Watson.</p><p>I had just lost my dad and I remembered all the songs we used to go and hear at concerts, and the records around the house and sometimes we&#39;d play together.</p><p>The real beauty of it - key to my life was playing key chords on a banjo. For somebody else it may be a golf club that mom and dad put in their hands or a baseball or ballet lessons. Real gift to give to me and put it in writing.</p><p>I&#39;m being a dad and a good husband.</p><p>I&#39;m worried because of my mother, she&#39;s going to see my performance and she&#39;s quite hard. She&#39;s going to see me naked. And my Dad, woah. Yeah, they&#39;re going to see me like a woman, you know?</p><p>My dad didn&#39;t want me to play guitar. He played piano, so I chose that. And I ended up loving it.</p><p>Growing up, my father was a financial analyst for an oil company. He was just a regular dad. And when I would say, &#39;Hey, come see my play,&#39; he&#39;d say, &#39;Sure.&#39; He&#39;d see one, &#39;Oh, good play&#39; - you know, very typical dad reaction.</p><p>I was a sickly baby, and after two sets of adoptive parents took me home, they returned me to the orphanage because of a serious respiratory infection. But as they say, the third time&#39;s a charm, because my mom and dad adopted me and took me into their home where I was raised in a family full of love.</p><p>Right now, it hasn&#39;t affected my music other than the fact that I don&#39;t have time to write any of it. That&#39;s no different from when I first started and I lived at home. I would play the guitar in the afternoon and then my mom or my dad would come home and I&#39;d have to quit.</p><p>The best thing about being a dad? Well, I think it&#39;s just the thing that every man wants - to have a son and heir.</p><p>We all feel really blessed to have been with my dad for these 85 years.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to be a dad. I just can&#39;t wait to have a little rug rat running around. I used to want five or six kids, but maybe I&#39;ve become too self-absorbed over the years. I think two would be perfect.</p><p>I lost my dad way too early and it was agonisingly awful. I missed him so much and I hated knowing that I could never again pick up the phone to tell him about my day.</p><p>But more importantly, I think he remembered how very close I was with my own dad, who had died in 1997.</p><p>My dad worked several jobs to pay for my expense in skating.</p><p>I was who I was in high school in accordance with the rules of conduct for a normal person, like obeying your mom and dad. Then I got out of high school and moved out of the house, and I just started, for lack of a better term, running free.</p><p>My kids love it. I thought I was the coolest dad in the world when I got to be in a Bond film, but &#39;Harry Potter&#39;, too? Well, I think I qualify for a medal for exceptional parenting or something, don&#39;t you?</p><p>My parents were both actors my dad sort of quite early on. My mother acted for a while, and now she&#39;s a painter.</p><p>I&#39;m an artist, and I go in the studio and make my music. And then I&#39;ll give it to my dad and he does what he does. And he does, you know, the press, and figuring out shows and whatnot. When it comes to my artistic freedom, he doesn&#39;t, like, step on my toes or anything.</p><p>A lot of young filmmakers bring their movies to my dad because he always gives lots of good editing ideas and notes. He&#39;d be a good film professor.</p><p>Mom was the one who taught me unconditional love. With Dad, I&#39;d always felt there was something to live up to - expectations. But in the last year, we had a wonderful relationship.</p><p>I didn&#39;t want to have braces when I was a kid and I&#39;m pretty sure my dad didn&#39;t want to pay for them.</p><p>Life is different than it was in the Nineties. I&#39;m a dad, and there are other things I have to get done in an afternoon than just being an artist.</p><p>If you had told me at 45 years old that I would have to go on tour to get rest, I would&#39;ve said, &#39;That&#39;s not how it works.&#39; But nothing can be more gratifying. I&#39;m a very hands-on dad.</p><p>So I was always around music and my dad was in his own way a progressive jazzer, a big band jazzer guy.</p><p>My dad farmed, my granddad was a farmer. I wanted to be a farmer.</p><p>When my dad died a lot of songs came, and they&#39;re still coming.</p><p>Because I was starting out in my 20&#39;s. I wanted to do it on my own. I didn&#39;t want to use my dad or have people say I was using him.</p><p>I&#39;m afraid that this is me getting on my high horse now but we have yob television, yob newspapers, and funny enough whereas it was my mum and dad, school, police, church who used to set the standards, now it&#39;s tabloids and yob television who set the standards by which people live.</p><p>That&#39;s what my Dad always told me, on the ballot, they should always have a third choice, like none of the above, then if enough people picked that, they&#39;d have to get new candidates.</p><p>I always had a standard of, back when I was doing the country music I always told people I would never record a song that I wouldn&#39;t sit down and sing in front of my mom and dad.</p><p>I deal with my sons like young men. If they have a problem with something, they come to me. I am the type of dad that will drop everything I am doing for them, and always tell them to talk to me about it.</p><p>I think when I was a kid, and I was in England and it was all about The Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Beatles and that&#39;s what my dad was into.</p><p>My dad is a huge rock and roll lead guitar fan. I didn&#39;t even really know that until recently. Everything has to have a guitar solo in it.</p><p>My dad is a huge rock n&#39; roll lead guitar fan.</p><p>I was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, the youngest of four girls, including my oldest sister, Lisa, who has special needs. My mom was a special education teacher, and my dad worked on the Army base. We weren&#39;t wealthy, but we were determined to succeed.</p><p>I&#39;m Bam Margera. And I feel like kicking my dad&#39;s butt all day today.</p><p>Dad went to Canada to learn how to fly with the Royal Canadian Air Force. He took me on my first airplane ride, where I could have a hand on the stick.</p><p>The last thing I want my child to see is Dad running around in the middle of the pack. That would really upset me. And that would upset him. I would be embarrassed to take him to school with kids saying, &#39;Hey, how&#39;d your dad do this weekend?&#39; &#39;Well, he finished fifth or sixth&#39;.</p><p>I had the best of both worlds when I was a kid. I&#39;d spend a quiet week with my mum, then I&#39;d go to my dad&#39;s property in the Adelaide Hills, where there were all these kids and animals running around.</p><p>My dad would always say, &#39;What can you do to make the world a better place?&#39; Well, I can make people laugh.</p><p>Tiffany is very proud to have the last name and she&#39;s proud of her dad.</p><p>As much as I transferred my mother to Elizabeth Shore of The Black Dahlia, as much as her dad mutated into an obsession with crime in general, well, I have thought about other things throughout the years.</p><p>I grew up watching Monday Night Football with Howard Cosell and the other guys with my dad.</p><p>So my dad raised me, and he&#39;s a huge football fan.</p><p>When I found out I got this job, I cried, of course - I&#39;m a girly-girl - and then I called my dad, and he cried, too. On so many levels, this is a thrill for me.</p><p>I grew up loving Walter Payton. My dad used to always show us film of him.</p><p>You know when everyone&#39;s watching, your mom and dad, your friends in high school who thought they were better than you. You get your chance to get in the spotlight and shine.</p><p>We would make songs, and the producers said we should play it for my dad. I was kind of scared, I didn&#39;t know what to think cuz we were just joking around.</p><p>My dad was a workaholic. I saw him work seven days a week.</p><p>I love my hockey, but if you can do that and go home and just be a dad and husband, then you have the best of both worlds.</p><p>Although becoming a singer was my plan A after first hearing Whitney Houston when I was 17, I started off with plan B by going to the teacher-training college that my dad went to. It was a slow coming of age.</p><p>I finished high school, moved to Nashville for college, and set out to break into the music business. Every night when I called home with news of my experiences, my mom and dad would encourage me to keep taking those small steps.</p><p>We sat together as a family for dinner at night. And my mother had a job. My dad had a job. But there was always a meal on the table at 6:00, you know.</p><p>From time to time, I&#39;ll look back through the personal journals I&#39;ve scribbled in throughout my life, the keepers of my raw thoughts and emotions. The words poured forth after my dad died, when I went through a divorce, and after I was diagnosed with breast cancer. There are so many what-ifs scribbled on those pages.</p><p>So I go to my first book signing, and these two girls came up and gave me a piece of paper: &#39;10 reasons you should date our dad. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. He&#39;s a lawyer.&#39; He didn&#39;t know what was going on. He didn&#39;t even know me. They called him, and he came down and asked me out that day. Now I&#39;m dating their dad!</p><p>Being an only child, I didn&#39;t have any other family but my mom and dad really, since the rest of my family lived quite far away from London.</p><p>I wanted my dad to be proud of me, and I fell into acting because there wasn&#39;t anything else I could do, and in it I found a discipline that I wanted to keep coming back to, that I love and I learn about every day.</p><p>My dad still calls me and makes sure I&#39;m taking my vitamins.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna be the best dad that ever lived. I&#39;ll have a ranch with a race car track and a golf course.</p><p>Recently, I was in Bernalda, my dad&#39;s ancestral home town in Italy. He has just refurbished a palazzo and turned it into a hotel, so we had my sister&#39;s wedding there. It was beautiful.</p><p>My dad had been shortstop when he was in college, and you know, when you&#39;re a kid, you want to be just like your dad.</p><p>As it has been told to me, my Dad had some kind of deal with Dick Clark. But when we got here, that fell through. So we were out here with no job, no furniture, no food.</p><p>In the original draft I was 27 and Peter was 55 in the script. That&#39;s not the same as a guy in his 40s and a dad in the end of his 70s. It&#39;s a different point in both our lives.</p><p>In fact, I had the idea because of Peter Falk. I saw my dad watching a Peter Falk movie and something clicked in my head. I gotta go make a movie for Peter Falk and me.</p><p>And in that time, I lost my dad and had kids of my own. It was like, OK, I get it now. I know what fatherhood is all about. And you look at your parents differently.</p><p>My Dad was so open creatively that I was off in search of black turtleneck bathing suits with long sleeves.</p><p>My mother is Italian and my dad&#39;s Irish. In my family, we&#39;re expressive. Nobody holds back.</p><p>My Dad died during the flu epidemic in 1918 when I was 4 years old. He left a lot of classical recordings behind that I began listening to at an early age, so he must have been a music lover.</p><p>Well, I am a lot like my dad, and the character of Ted is based on my dad.</p><p>Dad was a bus driver, and when he finished work he would repair cars.</p><p>When it came to the stylish and graceful art of ballroom dancing, my dad was a king of the clubs, a prowling tiger and a wonderfully natural mover.</p><p>Dad said that he was prouder of me than he&#39;d ever been when I came out.</p><p>Everybody always wants to rebel against their parents&#39; music, but nobody listened to music louder than my dad.</p><p>I used to be really nervous when I sang. Like, when I was a kid starting young, 18 and 19, and my dad really had to sort of push me to start singing in front of people. Ever since I got out there and really started doing it, the only thing I&#39;ve ever tried to do is just sort of is be myself, you know, never put on a voice. Sing naturally.</p><p>My dad was very fun and very adventurous, and from a formative age I learned to value men who would do things on a whim.</p><p>My dad let me figure out what I wanted to do on my own.</p><p>My dad&#39;s not a very intimidating father figure.</p><p>My dad&#39;s supportive of all my endeavors.</p><p>My dad has more sparkly stuff than most men.</p><p>When I was about 12 and first started wearing lipstick, my dad would ask, &#39;Are you wearing makeup?&#39; I would say back, &#39;You&#39;re wearing more makeup there than I am!&#39;</p><p>I can&#39;t remember a major league game where I could make eye contact with my dad. I kept wondering if he was going to yell at me for hanging a pitch or something.</p><p>My dad had a movie theater so I was there every night.</p><p>I&#39;m really, really lucky. I was given my dad&#39;s good genes.</p><p>I started playing ball when I was a kid. My dad was a pro ball player and he passed on his knowledge to me.</p><p>At times I&#39;ve got a really big ego. But I&#39;ll tell you the best thing about me. I&#39;m some guy&#39;s dad I&#39;m some little gal&#39;s dad. When I die, if they say I was Annie&#39;s husband and Zachary John and Anna Kate&#39;s father, boy, that&#39;s enough for me to be remembered by. That&#39;s more than enough.</p><p>I realised I could run after finding out that my dad used to run and it gave me the morale that if he did it then maybe I could also run.</p><p>I get around OK with a toolbox. As a kid, I picked up skills following my dad through the oil fields of Oklahoma and West Texas. My wife Janine is hard to impress, but she does think it&#39;s cool when I fix things around the house.</p><p>My dad is a really honest, hardworking, straight guy.</p><p>I had a dad you know.</p><p>And I remember leaving my place in L.A. and - my father is a big fight fan - and I said, &#39;Dad, I got a couple of days off and I&#39;m getting ready to go to Houston to sign to fight Muhammad Ali.</p><p>When you get pure joy out of &#39;being&#39; rather than &#39;doing&#39; or &#39;seeing,&#39; that&#39;s when you realize how big and unexplainable some things are and being a dad is one of those very few things.</p><p>Also, to be honest, my dad wanted me to be an athlete. And I think all sons want to prove something to their dad. So now, aged 35, I want to see what I can achieve physically.</p><p>I&#39;m one of five kids and we lived on a massive farm in New South Wales with my mum and dad.</p><p>Dad, I&#39;m in some trouble. There&#39;s been an accident and you&#39;re going to hear all sorts of things about me from now on. Terrible things.</p><p>My dad&#39;s a bodybuilder. My whole life I&#39;ve been taught to train the hard way. I believe in earning strength, not buying it. My grandfather raised me old school: In baseball, you work for whatever you get.</p><p>My background is basically scientific math. My Dad was a physicist, so I have it in my blood somewhere. Scientific method is very important to me. I think anything that contradicts it is probably not true.</p><p>My father was Catholic, my mother was Protestant, and because of that I got Christened in both churches, so I&#39;ve got all these names... but my Dad always called me Mick.</p><p>When I was a teenager, my dad used to call me &#39;Hollywood&#39; because I wore sunglasses all the time, even at night. Cue song.</p><p>My dad&#39;s one of my biggest heroes. I also think Paul Newman&#39;s an inspiration. I know a lot of people say that, but I love that he&#39;s a great role model and a humanitarian. I admire people who don&#39;t necessarily want to change the world, but try to make it a better environment.</p><p>It would be nice if I did have a good relationship with my family, and yes, part of me longs to have a mum and dad who love and accept me for who I am. But if they never do, it&#39;s OK.</p><p>He was a manager, one of the singers, I guess talent coordinator for the local talent in Harlem. His name was Lover Patterson. He was living right across the street from where my dad had his restaurant. I guess he saw a lot of kids come in, a lot of my buddies.</p><p>Many forms, sizes and colors, I think there are heroes in sports, in life... It would be cliche to say my dad, my granddad. I think I&#39;m a fan of people who were brave, my aunt, my grandmother, those are my heroes.</p><p>My mother&#39;s incredibly giving, almost too giving at times. And, my dad is a real logical person. He&#39;s got logic for every situation. They&#39;ve been married for 24 years, so there was that stability, also. I really learned to think on my own at a very young age.</p><p>I&#39;m left handed, but my dad taught me to play guitar right-handed.</p><p>My mum and my dad are the sweetest couple.</p><p>My dad was vehemently opposed to electric guitars. He did not look on that kind of music as legitimate in any way.</p><p>My dad served in the Air Force as ground crew for several years, and doesn&#39;t really talk about it. I know that it&#39;s there. I think my main thing about direct or indirect experiences as near to home as it were is the idea of self-sacrifice really.</p><p>Our dad was a great guy and we will never forget him.</p><p>That&#39;s a tough question I&#39;ve been acting since I was 10. My dad was an entrepreneur, so I guess something along those lines. I wouldn&#39;t want a 9-5 job.</p><p>I&#39;ve been acting since I was 10. My dad was an entrepreneur, so I guess something along those lines. I wouldn&#39;t want a 9-5 job.</p><p>On the one hand, I&#39;ve had such a normal upbringing with my mum, who has kept me grounded, but on the other, the wild experiences through my dad.</p><p>My mom&#39;s a Catholic, and my dad&#39;s a Jew, and they didn&#39;t want anything to do with anything.</p><p>The only other time I can recall my dad getting upset at me was when I missed a hockey practice. My parents were away, so my buddy and I decided to skip it. I never told my dad about it, but he found out from the coach.</p><p>Well my dad was a pretty good player at one stage and my two older brothers played golf as well. So there were always golf clubs flying around the house.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t sure how my dad would react. There was an agent sitting behind them and he told me he was embarrassed to watch the scenes. My parents have always been very open. They trust my decisions.</p><p>I used to listen to my dad a lot as a way of trying to be close to him, as well, because my parents were divorced and I didn&#39;t spend that much time with him. And I used to put headphones on and listen to my dad talk and sing and I found that quite... bonding with him, in a weird way.</p><p>It was sort of just a family sport. My mom and dad were pretty keen golfers when I was young and so were my grandparents, and I just sort of tagged along with them.</p><p>Things with my dad were pretty good until I won an Academy Award. He was really loving to me until I got more attention than he did. Then he hated me.</p><p>I would ask my dad what he did, and he&#39;d say, &#39;I listen to people&#39;s problems.&#39; In some way what he did for a living is in my genes.</p><p>But although Australia was also involved in the Vietnam conflict, I can remember my dad telling us that if we were in Australia, we wouldn&#39;t be drafted until we were 20.</p><p>When I was a kid, I wanted to walk with my dad&#39;s limp - my dad was my hero - but that infuriated him, and he would make me walk back and forth in the living room until I walked without it.</p><p>When I grew up, people said, &#39;You&#39;ll never be the man your dad was.&#39; And I said, &#39;Gee, I hope not.&#39;</p><p>My dad has always been really helpful. He taught me that talent is a bonus, but persistence is what wins out.</p><p>But my father was also the one who told me I needed to clean up my mouth or I&#39;d never find a man. What&#39;s very important to him is manners. Show up on time. Always send thank-you letters. He is one of the more thoughtful humans I&#39;ve ever met. He&#39;s a great man and a very good dad.</p><p>I didn&#39;t want to play a lawyer. I didn&#39;t want to play a doctor. I didn&#39;t want to play a single dad. I wanted to do something I felt I could learn from, something that would be a challenge and something that would not dry up.</p><p>I feel that marrying younger and being quite a young dad helped me with the stability of my career.</p><p>I worked with my dad for 15 years. I apprenticed under him and decided I wanted to become an architect. So I went to college for it and then the acting bug got me.</p><p>Indians mock their corrupt politicians relentlessly, but they regard their honest politicians with silent suspicion. The first thing they do when they hear of a supposedly &#39;clean&#39; politician is to grin. It is a cliche that honest politicians in India tend to have dishonest sons, who collect money from people seeking an audience with Dad.</p><p>I was born and raised in the high desert of Nevada in a tiny town called Searchlight. My dad was a hard rock miner. My mom took in wash. I grew up around people of strong values - even if they rarely talked about them.</p><p>I think women look for that quality in a man of being a good dad whether they&#39;re immediately wanting to be a parent or not.</p><p>I&#39;m just as insufferable and useless as every other dad is. The dynamic never changes, no matter what you do for a living.</p><p>My dad&#39;s Irish music was such a huge influence.</p><p>I feel very warm towards Mum and Dad for giving us the independence they did. My childhood, and the fact we didn&#39;t have a TV, gave me a boundless imagination.</p><p>I want babies. I think I&#39;ll be a great dad.</p><p>My dad was a singer in a band and neither of my parents went to college, and I ended up getting into Harvard and was the first person in my family that went to college and it happened to be Harvard.</p><p>The best thing I ever learned from my dad was he knew he wasn&#39;t the best of singers, but he always knew he was a great entertainer, and I always thought that was a good concept to bring along, that ultimately acting is an entertainment art and you have to be aware of the fact that you want people to be excited to be watching you.</p><p>My dad&#39;s era believed that there was something noble in being a good guy - the kind of guy that lived straight and narrow, told the truth, and stood up for what he believed was right.</p><p>My dad had been an actor... not only had my dad been an actor, but his dad had been an actor, and my great-grandfather had been an actor. And who knows before then?</p><p>I went and took golf lessons so Dad would let me play with him. I was just terrible... but I was able to have a wonderful time just walking around with Dad. I can see the real pleasure of that game.</p><p>When you&#39;re nearing 35, going, &#39;Hey Dad, I can&#39;t make these payments,&#39; just isn&#39;t cool.</p><p>I wanted to be an actress. I think it had a lot to do with being a kid and watching how every time my dad would stand up to talk people would applaud... that was pretty cool.</p><p>I look at my little girl and I wonder what she&#39;s going to be and what she&#39;s going to do and what is it that leads girls certain directions in life. I think a lot of that goes back to what kind of father they had, and so it makes me want to be the best dad I can possibly be.</p><p>I had always loved music. I grew up listening to classic country, Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard. My dad loved Vern Gosdin and Keith Whitley. So I kept going to class and started getting totally into playing guitar and teaching myself these songs.</p><p>My dad has always been very proud of me but I think I have exceeded his expectations. When I told him I wanted to be an actor and moved to New York City, I think he assumed I would be playing the guitar on the subway and collecting spare change in my guitar case. The fact that I&#39;m not doing that means that I&#39;m a huge success.</p><p>Dad really had little to do with the songs, except to perform them.</p><p>I wanted to travel with my dad to be close to him again. Having babies and raising my own family took so much of my time, I didn&#39;t have a chance to be with him very often.</p><p>My dad was the baby. When he was born they were already successful. They sent him to business school - he probably would have loved to have been a poet or a writer or something, and he was very creative.</p><p>My dad was born in Chicago in 1908... his parents came from Russia. They settled in Chicago, where they lived in a little tiny grocery store with eight or nine children - in the backroom all together - and my grandmother got the idea to go into the movie business.</p><p>My dad told me that no one could ever make it as a writer, that my chances were equivalent to winning the lottery - which was good for me, because I like to have something to prove.</p><p>From my dad I learned to be good to people, to always be honest and straightforward. I learned hard work and perseverance.</p><p>My dad is very successful in his business. He&#39;s always been big in having hobbies and having little ways to get away. He always made time for hunting and fishing. He always encouraged me to do it.</p><p>We had our first earthquake over here recently. That was a bizarre feeling. I just became disoriented and I remember my dad freaking out. Nothing broke or anything.</p><p>I suppose not everyone has a dad who wrote a book saying he didn&#39;t believe in the Parliamentary road to socialism.</p><p>There was nothing more important I could do than be supportive as a dad.</p><p>My dad named me Dakota and my mom came up with my first name Hannah. So it&#39;s Hannah Dakota Fanning.</p><p>My dad was a master butcher and I trained to be a butcher when I left school. I didn&#39;t enjoy it at the time but I love cooking now, so perhaps I would have been a chef.</p><p>I started off playing the clarinet, after I was inspired by listening to my dad&#39;s Benny Goodman records.</p><p>I absolutely love working with my dad because there is such an ease about it, and I also love his company.</p><p>I&#39;ve got an idea for a modern day faerie tale that I think would made a great short novel. But I just don&#39;t have the time to work on it right now. I&#39;m way too busy with the &#39;Kingkiller Chronicles&#39; and being a new dad.</p><p>If you met my dad, I think a lot of things would be put to rest. Because my pops is a pretty silly guy. But, Coldcut, they&#39;re based in the U.K. I&#39;m a big fan of jazz music, so American music has had a big influence on what I listen to.</p><p>When I realized I was having trouble reading, I was too embarrassed to ask for help. Some teachers believed in me, but I just wasn&#39;t focused on school - I was into the music and trying to please my dad.</p><p>I&#39;m an ambassador for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and one of the children, his wish was to go to the Emmys, so he&#39;s going to be my date, along with my husband, and my dad and his girlfriend. So we&#39;re going to have a really fun night and it&#39;s going to be really exciting. I&#39;m really excited for him to experience that.</p><p>My little son, Atticus, desperately needs his dad and I haven&#39;t been there for him... and that&#39;s sad.</p><p>Work ethic has always been stressed in my family. My dad is going to be 80 years old and he still works part time. My mom just retired a couple years ago and she&#39;s in her mid- to late 70s.</p><p>My dad always said I was hard-headed, that it would take something like that to wake me up spiritually, and I guess it did. My heart had gotten so beat up that I didn&#39;t have anything left to give.</p><p>You know, no matter what I am or what I do for a living, I&#39;m still, you know, the husband and the dad and the protector of the house, and I have to be conscientious about that.</p><p>Going through the grief period of my dad and losing him - that was the worst thing because you know when you get that call. When you are seven, eight years old, you have that almost vision in your mind of what that&#39;s going to be like and what your going to feel like and it doesn&#39;t prepare you.</p><p>I love being a dad. I&#39;d have more kids if I could. I&#39;d take a couple more, one or two more before I croak.</p><p>I&#39;ve got my dad&#39;s height and smoking habit. But I think I&#39;ve got my mum&#39;s looks and sensibilities.</p><p>My dad was an entrepreneurial businessman, and maybe I got some of his ability.</p><p>The people on my mum&#39;s side of the family are atheist intellectuals who are ueber-proper. My dad&#39;s side of the family are missionaries who are more comfortable sitting around in sweatpants than they are in a five-star restaurant. But those two influences converged in my life.</p><p>I recruited my dad to be my bass player and fired him on several occasions. He stayed on as a bus driver.</p><p>Whenever I did a good performance, my Dad and my uncles, who were rabid movie fans, took me to the movies. There began my underlying love affair with film.</p><p>My dad thinks Obama is a socialist and all these extreme views.</p><p>I&#39;m a good dad I spend a lot of time with my kids.</p><p>I was trying to make art that my son could look on in the future and would realize I was thinking about him very much during these times... that he can look and see my dad&#39;s thinking about me, but to also embed in these things something that is bigger than all of us.</p><p>I&#39;m probably a little more like my dad. But because of my mom, I never saw being a woman as being an impediment to being able to do something. She had her Ph.D. before I was born.</p><p>We always had lutefisk for Christmas dinner, after which Dad read from the Norwegian Bible.</p><p>Dad was a chemistry professor at Saint Olaf College in Minnesota, then Oxford College in Minnesota, and a very active member of the American Chemical Society education committee, where he sat on the committee with Linus Pauling, who had authored a very phenomenally important textbook of chemistry.</p><p>To those of you who are wearing ties, I think my dad would appreciate it if you took them off.</p><p>For my birthday this year, my girlfriends - who knew I&#39;d just inherited my dad&#39;s turntable - gave me a carton of albums like &#39;Blue Kentucky Girl,&#39; by Emmylou Harris, and &#39;Off the Wall,&#39; by Michael Jackson. It&#39;s all stuff we grew up with. I mean, you can&#39;t have a music collection without Prince&#39;s &#39;Purple Rain&#39; - it just can&#39;t be done!</p><p>We came from a family where we ran our own small business. Our dad made his own products. We made our own sausages, our own meatloafs, our own pickles. Dad had to do everything himself. He had to figure out how to finance his business.</p><p>My dad keeps joking about sneaking into my grandparents&#39; house and switching out their HBO for PBS so they think I&#39;m on &#39;Downton Abbey.&#39;</p><p>The best advice my dad ever gave me is that acting is believing. Acting is not acting. It isn&#39;t putting on a face and dancing around in a mask. It&#39;s believing that you are that character and playing him as if it were a normal day in the life of that character.</p><p>My dad never told me that when you audition, you might not get the role. He wanted to wait until my first disappointment to tell me.</p><p>I was really bright as a kid and tested well, and it was clear that I was going to get scholarships to any schools I wanted. My dad always said I could be an engineer at that time it was the elite of society: steady job, working in science, which was then the answer to every problem we had. It was kind of a mandate. Kind of a dream he had for me.</p><p>My parents loved each other. I was raised in a house of total love and respect. My dad worked very hard and my mother was incredibly devoted to him. I can unequivocally, without any peradventure of doubt, tell you that I was raised with the kind of love that we only dream of.</p><p>Dad is my best mate and I can tell Mum absolutely anything. I really appreciate Mum and Dad. Why are we so close? Young parents, I think. The rock business keeps their minds young.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t aware of my dad being an actor when I was young. I remember there was an Australian children&#39;s entertainer on television called Ralph Harris and when I&#39;d say my father was an actor, kids would say, you know, &#39;oh, is he Ralph Harris?&#39; And I had to say no and then they would lose interest.</p><p>He described how, as a boy of 14, his dad had been down the mining pit, his uncle had been down the pit, his brother had been down the pit, and of course he would go down the pit.</p><p>When my dad was badly weakened by the flu and my mom wanted to call an ambulance to take him to the emergency room, he wouldn&#39;t go unless he could shave first and change into a nice shirt and a pair of slacks.</p><p>I&#39;m probably going to get in trouble for this but &#39;American Dad&#39; is one of my favourite shows. It gets very dark in places but the jokes are there.</p><p>My dad is this very sensible guy who never let me feel that anything was beyond my station.</p><p>When I was little, I used to work with my dad on the engine of his car. Mostly this was a matter of me handing him wrenches.</p><p>My dad is kind of a rascal, like in a Dickensian sense. He just goes from career to career.</p><p>My life isn&#39;t that dramatic. My dad really loves me, he just can&#39;t talk on the phone. He&#39;s too crippled and shy, and that&#39;s almost harder. He&#39;s there and he loves me, and I try and try and try, it&#39;s just impossible to have a relationship.</p><p>I don&#39;t deal with death very well. My brother, John Candy, my dad, my mom, Brandon Tartikoff just a couple of weeks ago. I mean, you lose a lot of people in your life, and that&#39;s one thing I am constantly working on - pain management.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if there is a gene for comedy, but my dad was a very funny man. He just didn&#39;t know it. He was a naturally funny character, and when my brother and I would laugh at things he said and did, he would say, &#39;What do you think is so funny?&#39;</p><p>My dad was in the army so we moved around a lot and I changed schools every year and had to make new friends, and I found that if I was the funny guy I could do that easier.</p><p>I would say the most help I got was from my dad. My dad is a civil engineer in Switzerland he&#39;s 90 years old now, so he&#39;s no longer active as a civil engineer, but still a very active person.</p><p>My dad has no control over who works with me. Me, me and me alone has to take responsibility for anything.</p><p>Growing up, I had a front row seat to seeing two people work really hard. My dad scrubbed toilets at a private Catholic school for a while, and that was to help me get through school.</p><p>My family was very supportive of whatever I wanted because my grandfather was an opera singer. My dad&#39;s dad. So my dad has an appreciation for the arts, and he let me choose my own path.</p><p>I always wanted to be a father. I have a beautiful relationship with my dad and beautiful memories. I always knew I was going to have a family.</p><p>Every family is different. I am mom and I am dad and I&#39;m going to do my best. You should be proud, walk through life saying I have the coolest family. I am part of a modern family.</p><p>My dad served in two wars has been flying airplanes for 60 years now. He was certainly quite an inspiration.</p><p>I remember my dad, who coached football, would buy some of his players football shoes when they couldn&#39;t afford it.</p><p>But Dad and I are the only father-and-daughter acts who have both had No. 1 songs in England.</p><p>My dad passed away before my freshman year, and it altered how I thought. I was depressed - I didn&#39;t hang out with my friends. I worked through it by dancing.</p><p>My goal is for Gunnar to outlive me. That&#39;s the way it should be. My dream is for him to be a dad himself one day, so he can find out all the anxiety that kids bring to their dads.</p><p>My dad and grandpa were in the army and as a country singer you&#39;re constantly playing at military bases all across the country and meeting soldiers and their families and hearing their stories.</p><p>My dad was my first coach and drove me extremely hard from a very young age.</p><p>From my first dunk at 14 years old to my second NCAA Championship at the University of Tennessee, my intense training with my dad was always to credit.</p><p>On my best days, such as when I was a junior in high school coming off a 42-point performance and near triple-double, my dad was there to tell me I haven&#39;t arrived yet and bring me back to reality.</p><p>I love playing a dad. It&#39;s hard to find family dramas that are genuinely funny.</p><p>If a cow walked into this room, I&#39;d probably walk out. I could milk it, but my dad never forced me to do a lot of chores like that, mostly because he loved doing it himself.</p><p>My dad is a pilot so I think I was born with the travel bug.</p><p>I didn&#39;t really get into golf until I was about 14. My mom and dad were taking lessons from a pro an hour and a half from our farm in Cohuna, Australia. When they got home, I&#39;d ask my mom to explain everything they learned - drills and all.</p><p>I had my footballing heroes such as Bryan Robson and Diego Maradona but my dad was a rugby league star, and he was my real hero. But the relationship with my mum was rocky and we saw things that would affect any youngster.</p><p>A mustache really defines your face. My dad had a mustache when I was growing up, and I can still remember when he shaved it, he looked like a completely different person.</p><p>Some musicians I know are incredible fathers. Like Keith Richards. A fantastic dad.</p><p>I love Prince Harry. Good looking and a bit of a rebel. Me and his dad are as thick as thieves and I knew Harry before I knew his dad so we&#39;ve met a few times. I think he&#39;s amazing. And I think you can relate to him because he&#39;s made mistakes. He&#39;s cool.</p><p>We all have roles in life. I&#39;m a dad, a husband, this and that, but basically I only feel justified in being alive when I&#39;m on the stage.</p><p>I have a weird sense of humour. My dad&#39;s the same. We love watching &#39;Monty Python&#39; together.</p><p>My grandmother was an actress too. In the thirties and forties she was under contract with Universal Studios. Crazy credits, lots of them. My dad was also under contract with Universal Studios. And my first film was shot on the same stage they both worked on at Universal.</p><p>I got stuck up a tree when I was about seven, and my dad had to come and get the ladder to get me down. I loved to climb all the way up to the top. I must have been a koala in my past life.</p><p>No, like I said, my dad was never really part of the tennis. His involvement around what I did with the tennis and with my mom and my grandparents was really not a part of my life.</p><p>I&#39;ve hung out at dozens of playgrounds, bored out of my mind, with not even a look of comfort from disapproving mothers all around me. Either they think I&#39;m a pedophile or a deadbeat dad. That&#39;s what I get for being a single dad - suspicious looks at the playground.</p><p>My mum&#39;s parents were from Ireland, my dad&#39;s mum was American-Irish.</p><p>Obviously, losing a parent is very difficult. I miss my dad every day, but I know he would be proud to see me continuing to swim and going for another shot at the Olympics.</p><p>I actually study boxing - my dad was a Golden Gloves champion so I learned how to fight at a very young age. Growing up in Brooklyn you always had to watch your back, so I pretty much learned to protect myself.</p><p>I&#39;d always assumed that I would die at about the same age as my dad - he was 45. I am five years in credit now. I can&#39;t get my head around the fact that I am older than he was - ever.</p><p>I&#39;m a four star general in this thing, and you don&#39;t rise to the ranks of a four star general by hanging about the house being the perfect dad.</p><p>As I get older and I get a few more years experience I become more like Dad, you know, King Lear.</p><p>One day when I was like 9, I heard the Beatles on the radio, and I asked my dad who they were. He told me they were the best band in the world, and I became obsessed. He started giving me their albums in sequential order, and I listened to them - and only them - until I was probably in high school.</p><p>I think people like to think I&#39;m in some way financially dependent on my family - on my dad - but the fact of the matter is I&#39;ve been emancipated from my father since I was 14 years old. That&#39;s something people don&#39;t know or understand.</p><p>My mom grew up in Kansas, my dad in Indiana. They had boring childhoods.</p><p>My mom was a dancer, my dad&#39;s a singer and I&#39;ve always had that kind of music in my life.</p><p>From about eight years old I was always making things on the sewing machine. Friends would see me making dresses and costumes, and I&#39;d use difficult fabrics such as Lycra and elastic. But you know, my dad was creative and my brother is inventive too.</p><p>Mum and dad thought I was going to say I was pregnant. I said oh no, no, I&#39;ve just been nominated for a Golden Globe. They were like, oh that&#39;s lovely, love.</p><p>One of the accidental joys of my writing life has been that I&#39;ve had some lovely, surprisingly good fortune with readers, and I&#39;ve brought readers to my dad&#39;s work. I can&#39;t tell you the joy that gives me. Because my father&#39;s work was masterful.</p><p>Somewhere in my wildest childhood I must have done something right. Being able to make a boyhood dream come true is one thing, but to have a kid come along and thrill his dad like Brett Hull has thrilled me over his career is too much for one guy to handle.</p><p>My dad and mom divorced when I was around ten, and I didn&#39;t live with him after that, though he was close by and we saw each other weekly. I wasn&#39;t really aware that he was a writer I didn&#39;t start reading his writing until I was about fifteen. It occurred to me then that my dad was kind of special he&#39;s still one of my favorite writers.</p><p>The most challenging part of being a dad is self-restraint. So often your instinct is to teach and tell. I am constantly reminding myself to listen to them.</p><p>I&#39;m a dad now and whatever I&#39;m doing in life I usually put a lot of effort into it - usually too much effort, so it kind of comes off ridiculous at times.</p><p>I grew up in a big Irish, Catholic family. My dad was a pretty rough guy. So one of my brothers left home when he was 15 and found his way to the gym. It gave me the opportunity to go and spend some time with him and work out in the gym.</p><p>I know who my dad is, I&#39;ve met him a few times, but I don&#39;t even call him dad. I know it sounds horrible, but I don&#39;t even see him as part of my family, to be honest. If you want the truth, it doesn&#39;t bother me because I don&#39;t know any different. I just know that me and my mum, that was my family.</p><p>My folks have played everything from rock, disco, pop, funk, and blues. My dad has always brought and played different genres like jazz, classical, and Latin. With all this in my pocket, I feel I have a taste of everything for my influences.</p><p>I love my daughter, but she had me on couscous and fixed me pastas and made me eat oatmeal every morning and what else, turkey burgers, turkey bacon, and that kind of stuff. So she wants her dad to live a long time, and I do, too.</p><p>It&#39;s always been a dream of mine to get somewhere and to have my mom and dad with me up there.</p><p>My dad wanted me to play when I was a kid, so I learned to play the guitar. I pursued a career in music because I love it so much and I enjoy what it does to those who hear it.</p><p>I needed to step away from music because the truth was I couldn&#39;t be the dad I wanted to be to my kids. My truth was that I could not reconcile the two worlds - the entertainment world and being the dad I wanted to be in the present. You can&#39;t substitute time, you just can&#39;t.</p><p>All my band members were old enough to be my dad. It was like this family vibe.</p><p>Truthfully, I&#39;m still Corey Hart, Dad, first.</p><p>I think that every therapist that I know, including my dad and my sister, have their own issues. But that empathy is what makes them good at their job.</p><p>Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life.</p><p>My dad was good friends with the Bad Medicine Blues Band - one of the only blues bands in Fargo, as you can imagine! He took me out to see them play when I was 12 years old and I was really inspired by their guitar player, Ted Larsen.</p><p>My dad was a good athlete. My mom had longevity. There were some athletic genes that certainly got passed down.</p><p>I miss my Dad. My Dad loved cheesy monster movies, so we&#39;d have Godzilla movie marathons. Those are some of my favorite memories, laughing at how the monster outfits were so bad, like black garbage bags for heads.</p><p>I&#39;ve always had an affinity for lawyers. My dad is a lawyer. He&#39;s retired now. My brother is a lawyer.</p><p>Every dad who loves his daughter is not going to want her to go with the penniless slacker loser poet bum, when she could go out with someone who&#39;s successful.</p><p>My dad died when I was three so my mom had to raise four kids on her own, and I think there&#39;s a part of me that pulls upon having watched my mom do that our whole lives. She had to make it work.</p><p>Usually a family is led through the mom or the dad and their career and for the family to be led by my career, even though God has led it, could be a lot of pressure.</p><p>No one was more important than my mom and dad. I know they are watching from a place up in heaven here today to make sure all their kids are doing good.</p><p>My dad recently reminded me that my grandfather&#39;s cousin was Lefty Frizzell.</p><p>I was brought up in a car family, my dad loved cars and I was taught the art of making an Austin 7 operate.</p><p>My dad&#39;s an architect and my mom owned a French bakery for twelve years.</p><p>My mum was very conscious about fashion and my dad was born into the tailoring tradition, so fashion has always been my life, although now, really, I wear the same thing - just in different weights - light and heavy cashmere in winter and cotton in summer.</p><p>I always told my dad I&#39;d play professional football.</p><p>My dad doesn&#39;t like religion much, but I grew up very close to the Baptist tradition. God isn&#39;t this distant thing. God is right here with you all the time. He&#39;s your buddy, and you can talk about everything.</p><p>My dad was an inventor, and I think I&#39;ve always had a rosy view of technology, or at least its potential.</p><p>My dad, like many Southern men, is this very emotionally expressive person who isn&#39;t as articulate in words about his feelings as he is with breaking a chair or something like that.</p><p>My dad was an engineer and so I had this picture of science and technology and pursuits of the mind as being more impressive than artistic pursuits, which I saw a as kind of frivolous.</p><p>I also turn down what&#39;s probably a good amount of coinage to be made out of playing dads, an incredible number of obnoxious dad.</p><p>My mom and dad - they were always there. They were always on the set. They focused on our family life. The entertainment business wasn&#39;t the end-all. They weren&#39;t out to get the next big paycheck or the next big movie. It was about &#39;What can we do as a family.&#39;</p><p>I lost my mother, who suffered from Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and we had to relocate my dad after 58 years in the family home. That was tough.</p><p>You know that family is going to be there for you no matter what. My dad gave me a freakin&#39; kidney!</p><p>I have mostly been terrified of listening to scary stories around a campfire. We camp a lot as a family, and at night my dad would try and tell us scary stories. This made eating s&#39;mores difficult. The story would start with something like... &#39;and the old man who lived in these woods...&#39; I would then run back into the camper terrified.</p><p>Everyone gets surprised because neither one of my parents play golf. Like I said in my speech, my aunt and uncle really love golf, and we visited them, and she gave me two clubs. Like people think when they don&#39;t know who my dad is, they think he&#39;s my coach.</p><p>My sensei was a British karate champion named Brian Fitkin. He was my mentor and because I had a hard relationship with my dad, he became a father figure to me.</p><p>To me I&#39;m just a regular person going to the mall with friends, and now I&#39;m in Forever 21 and I see this random group of girls staring at me and taking pictures. But now I usually have my dad, who is a really tall and intimidating person with me, so he&#39;s kind of my bodyguard.</p><p>Save a boyfriend for a rainy day - and another, in case it doesn&#39;t rain.</p><p>Falling in love and having a relationship are two different things.</p><p>I don&#39;t have a girlfriend. But I do know a woman who&#39;d be mad at me for saying that.</p><p>You can&#39;t stop loving or wanting to love because when its right it&#39;s the best thing in the world. When you&#39;re in a relationship and its good, even if nothing else in your life is right, you feel like your whole world is complete.</p><p>Real magic in relationships means an absence of judgment of others.</p><p>If there hadn&#39;t been women we&#39;d still be squatting in a cave eating raw meat, because we made civilization in order to impress our girlfriends.</p><p>Nothing is perfect. Life is messy. Relationships are complex. Outcomes are uncertain. People are irrational.</p><p>I&#39;m not the girl who always has a boyfriend. I&#39;m the girl who rarely has a boyfriend.</p><p>I like the bad-boy types. Generally the guy I&#39;m attracted to is the guy in the club with all the tattoos and nail polish. He&#39;s usually the lead singer in a punk band and plays guitar. But my serious boyfriends are relatively clean-cut, nice guys. So it&#39;s strange.</p><p>There&#39;s only two people in your life you should lie to... the police and your girlfriend.</p><p>Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women.</p><p>Assumptions are the termites of relationships.</p><p>I&#39;m quite sensitive to women. I saw how my sister got treated by boyfriends. I read this thing that said when you are in a relationship with a woman, imagine how you would feel if you were her father. That&#39;s been my approach, for the most part.</p><p>Nothing defines humans better than their willingness to do irrational things in the pursuit of phenomenally unlikely payoffs. This is the principle behind lotteries, dating, and religion.</p><p>It seems essential, in relationships and all tasks, that we concentrate only on what is most significant and important.</p><p>A relationship requires a lot of work and commitment.</p><p>However successful you are, there is no substitute for a close relationship. We all need them.</p><p>Do not just look at your boyfriend as just a boyfriend. Look at him as a friend, too.</p><p>Treasure your relationships, not your possessions.</p><p>Personally, I don&#39;t like a girlfriend to have a husband. If she&#39;ll fool her husband, I figure she&#39;ll fool me.</p><p>Right now I&#39;m pretty single... My career is my boyfriend.</p><p>You know, the man of my dreams might walk round the corner tomorrow. I&#39;m older and wiser and I think I&#39;d make a great girlfriend. I live in the realm of romantic possibility.</p><p>People could rationally decide that prolonged relationships take up too much time and effort and that they&#39;d much rather do other kinds of things. But most people are afraid of rejection.</p><p>You know when I feel inwardly beautiful? When I am with my girlfriends and we are having a &#39;goddess circle&#39;.</p><p>I am a hopeless romantic and I love to spoil my girlfriends.</p><p>I used to be a real prince charming if I went on a date with a girl. But then I&#39;d get to where I was likely to have a stroke from the stress of keeping up my act. I&#39;ve since learned the key to a good date is to pay attention on her.</p><p>Well, a girlfriend once told me never to fight with anybody you don&#39;t love.</p><p>If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure.</p><p>If you don&#39;t have a valentine, hang out with your girlfriends, don&#39;t go looking for someone. When it&#39;s right, they&#39;ll come to you.</p><p>I don&#39;t know the first real thing about the dating game. I don&#39;t know how to talk to a specific person and connect. I just think you have to go to person by person and do the best you can with people in general.</p><p>I&#39;m 31 now. I think I&#39;m beginning to understand what life is, what romance is, and what a relationship means.</p><p>My boyfriend and I broke up. He wanted to get married and I didn&#39;t want him to.</p><p>Watching your daughter being collected by her date feels like handing over a million dollar Stradivarius to a gorilla.</p><p>I can&#39;t even find someone for a platonic relationship, much less the kind where someone wants to see me naked.</p><p>If you&#39;re a sports fan you realize that when you meet somebody, like a girlfriend, they kind of have to root for your team. They don&#39;t have a choice.</p><p>I suppose I was a little bit of what would be called today a nerd. I didn&#39;t have girlfriends, and really I wasn&#39;t a very social boy.</p><p>I don&#39;t understand the whole dating thing. I know right off the bat if I&#39;m interested in someone, and I don&#39;t want them to waste their money on me and take me out to eat if I know I&#39;m not interested in that person.</p><p>Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny. Maybe that&#39;s why I don&#39;t have a boyfriend.</p><p>Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of lies and mutually accepted delusion.</p><p>Right now, I&#39;m as single as a slice of American cheese.</p><p>I&#39;ve been dating since I was fifteen. I&#39;m exhausted. Where is he?</p><p>I&#39;ve never been Romeo who meets a girl and falls for her immediately. It&#39;s been a much slower process for me each time I&#39;ve gone into a relationship.</p><p>I change my mind so much I need two boyfriends and a girlfriend.</p><p>I&#39;m dating a woman now who, evidently, is unaware of it.</p><p>I&#39;ve had enough boyfriends and enough issues. I&#39;d seen enough train wrecks.</p><p>If your best friend has stolen your girlfriend, it does become life and death.</p><p>I was dating this guy and we would spend all day text messaging each other. And he thought that he could tell that he liked me more because he actually spelt the word &#39;YOU&#39; and I just put the letter &#39;U&#39;.</p><p>Which is, I&#39;m an optimist that two people can be together to work out their conflicts. And that commitment, I think, might be what love is, because they both grow from their relationship.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have a financial need, and I wasn&#39;t very gifted at relationships. I probably was more like what we think of boys as being: hard to pin down and wary of commitment.</p><p>My boyfriend calls me &#39;princess&#39;, but I think of myself more along the lines of &#39;monkey&#39; and &#39;retard&#39;.</p><p>We are constantly protecting the male ego, and it&#39;s a disservice to men. If a man has any sensitivity or intelligence, he wants to get the straight scoop from his girlfriend.</p><p>Thank God I never got in a fight. All of the jock dudes hated me, but all of their girlfriends thought I was nice so they wouldn&#39;t touch me. It was infuriating to them.</p><p>I have a lot of boyfriends, I want you to write that. Every country I visit, I have a different boyfriend. And I kiss them all.</p><p>I love being a single mom. But it&#39;s definitely different when you&#39;re dating.</p><p>I always say now that I&#39;m in my blonde years. Because since the end of my marriage, all of my girlfriends have been blonde.</p><p>Maybe the most that you can expect from a relationship that goes bad is to come out of it with a few good songs.</p><p>Rumors about me? Calista Flockhart, Pam Anderson, and Matt Damon. That&#39;s who I&#39;m dating.</p><p>My girlfriend bought me a down jacket, she said it fit my personality.</p><p>You show your vulnerability through relationships, and those feelings are your soft spot. You need to have a soft spot.</p><p>Last year my boyfriend gave me a painting - a very personal one. I really prefer personal gifts or ones made by someone for me. Except diamonds. That&#39;s the exception to the rule.</p><p>Things were a lot simpler in Detroit. I didn&#39;t care about anything but boyfriends.</p><p>I have stepped off the relationship scene to come to terms with myself. I have spent most of my adult life being &#39;someone&#39;s girlfriend&#39;, and now I am happy being single.</p><p>I think if I could have a boyfriend like my brothers I&#39;d be really happy. But without the brother thing.</p><p>At this year&#39;s Open, I&#39;ll have five boyfriends.</p><p>I fantasize about going back to high school with the knowledge I have now. I would shine. I would have a good time, I would have a girlfriend. I think that&#39;s where a lot of my pain comes from. I think I never had any teenage years to go back to.</p><p>I don&#39;t know any of us who are in relationships that are totally honest - it doesn&#39;t exist.</p><p>It was just that we had this phenomenal honeymoon relationship that just kept on going.</p><p>In a relationship you have to open yourself up.</p><p>It&#39;s always been my personal feeling that unless you are married, there is something that is not very dignified about talking about who you are dating.</p><p>Relationships in general make people a bit nervous. It&#39;s about trust. Do I trust you enough to go there?</p><p>I started dating older men, and I would fall in love with them. I thought they could teach me about life.</p><p>I think more dating stuff is scheduling. It&#39;s needing people who understand your work schedule.</p><p>It&#39;s weird, I never wish anything bad upon anybody, except two or three old girlfriends.</p><p>What I remember most about junior homecoming was my date getting sick afterwards. That kinda sucked. Then, senior year, someone got gum in her hair when we were dancing. She had to get one of the chaperones to take her to the office and cut up her hair. I felt really bad for her, but it worked out fine.</p><p>I stopped dating for six months a year ago. Dating requires a lot of energy and focus.</p><p>Appearance is something you should definitely consider when you&#39;re going out. Have your girlfriend clip your nails or something like that.</p><p>I&#39;m not cynical about marriage or romance. I enjoyed being married. And although being single was fun for a while, there was always the risk of dating someone who&#39;d owned a lunch box with my picture on it.</p><p>The prospect of dating someone in her twenties becomes less appealing as you get older. At some point in your fife, your tolerance level goes down and you realize that, with someone much younger, there&#39;s nothing really to talk about.</p><p>Workshops and seminars are basically financial speed dating for clueless people.</p><p>I prefer ordinary girls - you know, college students, waitresses, that sort of thing. Most of the girls I go out with are just good friends. Just because I go out to the cinema with a girl, it doesn&#39;t mean we are dating.</p><p>My philosophy of dating is to just fart right away.</p><p>Pamela Anderson Lee released a statement confirming that she has had her breast implants removed. Doctors say that Pamela is doing fine and that her old implants are now dating Charlie Sheen.</p><p>I want my audience to know me for my work, not because of who I&#39;m dating or what drugs I&#39;m on or what club I went to.</p><p>It&#39;s a big responsibility dating me. Because I come with a little bit of baggage, you know?</p><p>Good-looking individuals are treated better than homely ones in virtually every social situation, from dating to trial by jury.</p><p>I can&#39;t even explain to you how terrible that feels, that I equate dating a woman with punishment, shame, guilt, disappointment, reproach, reprimand, persecution. It&#39;s a nightmare.</p><p>When I was first divorced, I started dating younger women, and it was really exciting. But after a while I was like, &#39;This is just dumb.&#39;</p><p>You are not alone with a guy until you are a proper age. You don&#39;t go to certain levels with men until you are married or you have a certain relationship.</p><p>I&#39;m honest about the journey I&#39;ve been on, so I definitely don&#39;t take dating lightly anymore.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine dating a boy, meeting him only outside the home. What&#39;s a home and family for if it&#39;s not the center of one&#39;s life?</p><p>When I started dating I had this kind of Romeo and Juliet, fateful romantic idea about love which was almost that you were a victim and there was a lot of pain involved and that was how it should be.</p><p>All my freakouts have been pretty private and directed at family pets and/or people I have been dating for too short a time to freak out at in that way.</p><p>People say, &#39;Just say who you&#39;re dating. Then people will stop being so ravenous about it.&#39; It&#39;s like, No they won&#39;t! They&#39;ll ask for specifics.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t tell you anything about anybody I cared about because it becomes entertainment for other people, and it sort of just cheapens everything in your life. I would never tell you if I was dating anybody.</p><p>I&#39;m not very experienced with boys or the whole dating thingy.</p><p>Well, dating has become a sport and not about finding the person you love.</p><p>I&#39;m friends with a lot of my exes, but it took time. We didn&#39;t just get into it. I don&#39;t think you can be friends until you&#39;re cool with them dating someone else. That&#39;s when you know.</p><p>I&#39;m not great at dating, but I need to do it to relax.</p><p>Dating is just awkward moments and one person wants more than the other. It&#39;s just that constant strangeness. I think it&#39;s a very real thing.</p><p>I give dating advice on a regular basis. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m any expert, but it&#39;s always nice to share that with your friends.</p><p>I don&#39;t really believe in rules, but I do like old-fashioned dating where you don&#39;t call the guy until he calls you. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like he&#39;s got to do this and that&#39;s the rule.</p><p>I don&#39;t have the best dating track record.</p><p>Dating is all about the chase. It&#39;s fun!</p><p>Dating in Los Angeles can be hard, which makes it all the better when you meet a really nice guy.</p><p>I&#39;m not old-fashioned when it comes to dating, but there&#39;s something nice about a guy pulling out a girl&#39;s chair and opening the door for her, even if it&#39;s just in the beginning.</p><p>My mom is going to kill me for talking about sleeping with people. But I don&#39;t want to put myself in the position where I&#39;m in a monogamous relationship right now. I&#39;m not dating just one person. &#39;Sex and the City&#39; changed everything for me because those girls would sleep with so many people.</p><p>Coming through the fire and through the storm of life with a strong man, my fiance Ashanti, whom I&#39;ve been dating for eight months and two wonderful children beside me, I&#39;m just so happy that I have been able to maintain my integrity and get to where I am today with the right energy around me.</p><p>I&#39;m much more interested in what an actor has to say about something substantial and important than who they&#39;re dating or what clothes they&#39;re wearing or some other asinine, insignificant aspect of their life.</p><p>I&#39;ve had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner&#39;s girlfriends, and he of course was much older than me, but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.</p><p>I have put gay dating on the map.</p><p>I had to find a diet that would kick me back into dating shape, because I know that I can&#39;t date at size 8. I have to date at size 2. And it&#39;s just a fact of nature. Go get your injections and your chemical peels. You gotta look good to attract a man.</p><p>Taylor Swift dates guys so she can write a breakup song about them. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s dating for love - I think she&#39;s dating for creativity. So let&#39;s get her off the market and put her in dating detox. If she really wants love, she has to stop writing music about them.</p><p>The rich are different. Their wants are very high maintenance. They&#39;ll pick eye color and hair color, all the way down to what she does for a living, what school she went to. Their list can be extremely long. But at the end of the day, dating is dating, because they&#39;re human beings.</p><p>Dating is kind of hard. Like dinner or something like that. Like a forced awkward situation is very strange. Especially for me, for some reason.</p><p>I grew up in the world of bad television, on my dad&#39;s sets and then as a young schmuck on dating shows and so on.</p><p>No one knew me until I met my wife Lulu. Lulu&#39;s mother used to ask, Which one is Maurice? For six months she thought Lulu was dating Barry.</p><p>I&#39;m so an all-or-nothing person in dating, always. I&#39;m big on not wasting time. And so, yeah, if something&#39;s not working, it&#39;s time to not hold people back.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why anyone would want to ask an actor for dating advice. We are not the poster children for healthy relationships.</p><p>After a number of years dating, we decided we were good partners.</p><p>I always hated high-school shows and high-school movies, because they were always about the cool kids. It was always about dating and sex, and all the popular kids, and the good-looking kids. And the nerds were super-nerdy cartoons, with tape on their glasses. I never saw &#39;my people&#39; portrayed accurately.</p><p>Dating is really hard because everyone puts on a front. It&#39;s really difficult to see who is who, so it is important to be yourself.</p><p>At the time that I knew them, they were not living together. They began dating again after their divorce, so I didn&#39;t really see fighting.</p><p>Dodi got a lot of criticism when he began dating Princess Diana. No one seemed to think he was good enough for her.</p><p>I&#39;m often dating people, but I don&#39;t say it because you sort of know it won&#39;t last long.</p><p>It&#39;s just me and my 6-month-old puppy. I am not dating anyone.</p><p>I was dating my first boyfriend in high school for a long time, and we broke up before prom. I hadn&#39;t met anyone else that I really wanted to go with, and my friends have always been amazing. So I went with my friends and got a million photos with them!</p><p>The Google algorithm was a significant development. I&#39;ve had thank-you emails from people whose lives have been saved by information on a medical website or who have found the love of their life on a dating website.</p><p>I&#39;ve had a little bad, bad media luck the new year. Well, apparently I&#39;m dating Bill Clinton, which makes me nervous. I didn&#39;t know, though.</p><p>I also find it interesting that a lot of people in their 30s are not married and don&#39;t have kids. There are a lot of people in this age bracket that are out there dating and trying to find love. And I never thought that at my age I would be.</p><p>Dating co-stars is natural. When you&#39;re working with someone, it&#39;s habit.</p><p>We had two rules growing up in my house: If you&#39;re going to take a shower, do it with whomever you&#39;re dating so you don&#39;t waste water and if you buy one for yourself, buy six, because everybody&#39;s going to want one.</p><p>If I&#39;m with a man, is that going to prevent me from achieving my goal? What sacrifices will I have to make in terms of being myself, if I&#39;m with a man? Something that young women find out really quickly is that when you start dating, all of a sudden you&#39;re supposed to have a role. You&#39;re not allowed to just be yourself.</p><p>Evolution is unobservable. It&#39;s based on blind faith in a few dry bones and on unreliable dating systems in which the gullible trust. Kids should be allowed to make up their own minds about this issue, and not be censored to &#39;one side is all we will let you hear.&#39;</p><p>I ain&#39;t scared to do another dating show, but I ain&#39;t really trying to. I want to do a talk show or something. I&#39;ve done enough dating on television. I&#39;m ready to spread my wings, and go down other avenues.</p><p>Like many of you, I&#39;ve always been slightly obsessed with vampires, dating back to the prime-time series &#39;Dark Shadows,&#39; which I followed avidly as a kid.</p><p>I like the idea of dating, but I&#39;m not dating anyone exclusively, particularly right now. It&#39;s hard to be in a relationship unless you&#39;re ready to go public with it. So it&#39;s a lot easier for me to not be in a relationship. I really don&#39;t want that part of my life to be tabloid fodder.</p><p>I wish I was dating one of the ladies in &#39;Bollywood Hero.&#39; They&#39;re gorgeous. Any of them.</p><p>I&#39;m finally dating. It&#39;s fun.</p><p>Mary Tyler Moore was a working woman whose story lines were not always about dating and men. They were about work friendships and relationships, which is what I feel my adult life has mostly been about.</p><p>I&#39;m very open to dating and finding a guy.</p><p>Are you kidding? I&#39;m a terrible cook, but John is a really great one. Literally, I never cook. The whole time we were dating, I prepared two officially romantic meals. Both of them were such disasters that he begs me never to go into the kitchen again.</p><p>I don&#39;t have dating tips.</p><p>I have no wisdom to share on dating.</p><p>I&#39;m not interested in dating. I like being with my own best friend, me. Certain women, particularly older women, cannot believe I like going to a social event by myself. But I do.</p><p>So if I was dating somebody now and the relationship didn&#39;t work out, I&#39;d take that as failing.</p><p>You know, I had my mother and my father convincing me that he would be going back to Hollywood and he&#39;d be back with the actresses and dating them and that he wasn&#39;t serious about me at all. So I had him saying one thing to me and my parents telling me something else.</p><p>Dating is different when you get older. You&#39;re not as trusting, or as eager to get back out there and expose yourself to someone.</p><p>So I go to my first book signing, and these two girls came up and gave me a piece of paper: &#39;10 reasons you should date our dad. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. He&#39;s a lawyer.&#39; He didn&#39;t know what was going on. He didn&#39;t even know me. They called him, and he came down and asked me out that day. Now I&#39;m dating their dad!</p><p>Celebrities say they date other celebrities because they have the same job. But I think they just like dating famous people. Celebrities attract each other, like cattle.</p><p>I&#39;ve always gone out with much younger guys. But I rushed into relationships before really getting to know the person. What would come up as a warning sign within the first two weeks of dating would usually be the exact reason the relationship would end!</p><p>Here&#39;s the funny thing about the response I&#39;ve been aware of to my dating famous people: It&#39;s been very negative. I&#39;m either not good-looking enough, not a good enough actor or not successful enough for these people.</p><p>It&#39;s ironic, really. Guys should be excited that I got Kristen Bell. If Brad Pitt gets Kristen Bell, it&#39;s like, &#39;Well, of course he did.&#39; With me, it should be, &#39;Oh good, a normal-looking guy got her. Maybe I&#39;ll get me a Kristen Bell.&#39; But guys hate my guts for always dating women I have no right to be with.</p><p>Stuff about me dating Kim Kardashian - I have no idea where that came from and all these other rumors. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that type.</p><p>I think feminism&#39;s a bit misinterpreted. It was about casting off all gender roles. There&#39;s nothing wrong with a man holding a door open for a girl. But we sort of threw away all the rules, so everybody&#39;s confused. And dating becomes a sloppy, uncomfortable, unpleasant thing.</p><p>The woman I am currently crazy about was a vegetarian for a year until I started dating her. As is the case with most vegetarians, she had never eaten properly prepared meat, only commercially packaged or otherwise abused flesh.</p><p>I don&#39;t mind dating younger men now.</p><p>Women always try to see the one good part of The Weird Guy because the dating landscape is so bleak. Women will say, &#39;He&#39;s very odd, but he likes to cook. He&#39;s creepy, but he makes good pancakes!&#39;</p><p>The learned are not agreed as to the time when the Gospel of John was written some dating it as early as the year 68, others as late as the year 98 but it is generally conceded to have been written after all the others.</p><p>I&#39;m opening up my heart to the idea of dating. It&#39;s funny - my friends would always come to me for romantic advice. I know nothing, and things have changed since I was dating in high school! I&#39;m really trying hard to spend this time working on myself.</p><p>I heard on public radio recently, there&#39;s a thing called Weed Dating. Singles get together in a garden and weed and then they take turns, they keep matching up with other people. Two people will weed down one row and switch over with two other people. It&#39;s in Vermont. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be very good at Weed Dating.</p><p>It was funny actually because that was still during the time we were dating. He would get all these calls because supposedly before we broke up, we had already broken up in the trades, in the rags or whatever.</p><p>I&#39;ve been in plenty of situations where someone I&#39;m dating had more time for a console than me.</p><p>I tried to tell them about the dating process because I&#39;m single now and how horrible it is and how many foolish experiences I had had dating. So I was really selling him hard, but the whole time he really wanted me!</p><p>My wife and I have been together since 1986. I graduated in &#39;86 and she graduated in &#39;88. We began dating when she was 17. Actually she turned 18 when we started kissing and stuff.</p><p>I highly suggest marriage to all my friends who are dating.</p><p>You&#39;re talking to someone who has been married to various people for the last 40 years of her life. Dating is not really something familiar. I&#39;ve never really been a dater.</p><p>I am dating, but it is hard to find someone quick enough and funny enough. I am quite demanding.</p><p>Years later I would hear my father say the divorce had left him dating his children. That still meant picking us up every Sunday for a matinee and, if he had the money, an early dinner somewhere.</p><p>In my own relationships, I know that I should break up with someone who doesn&#39;t encourage me to be strong and make my own choices and do what&#39;s best in my life, so if you&#39;re dating someone who doesn&#39;t want you to be the best person you can be, you shouldn&#39;t be dating them.</p><p>I&#39;m a fan of horrors. I love the ones that make you jump. My girlfriend hates it. I&#39;ve been dating her for one-and-a-half years and I&#39;m crazy about her, but she&#39;s terrified of horror films. Not the cute &#39;Will you hold me?&#39; way, but she&#39;s weeping. With &#39;House of Wax,&#39; we&#39;ll be sleeping and I&#39;ll go to the bathroom and she&#39;s sitting up waiting for me.</p><p>Yeah, I think everybody has the crises of questioning themselves at some point or other in their lives. Is this where I should live? The job I should have? The girl I should be dating? Is this the friend I should have?</p><p>I feel like I am a real artist and I want to be able to feel what I am singing about. So when I sing, &#39;Leave (Get Out),&#39; I have been through that. I think it is just a new generation, whether people are ready for it or not. Teenagers are dating.</p><p>Dating and getting attention from boys was something that came later to me.</p><p>It&#39;s weird to have people so interested in your personal life. It&#39;s a part of the business that grosses me out. I&#39;m always bummed out for people who just happen to be dating a celebrity, and they&#39;re also famous, and they can&#39;t live their life.</p><p>My daughter&#39;s mother and I are no longer dating, and the people I&#39;m most likely to date are those around me, who are athletes.</p><p>I do like dating cynics - they tend to be incredibly funny.</p><p>Work takes up a lot of my brain space. So when I work, it&#39;s one thing. I don&#39;t have a lot of time to think about dating.</p><p>I can&#39;t wait for my little sisters to start dating, because it will really be fun to pick on their boyfriends.</p><p>I&#39;ve been dating younger men since my 20s, When I was 29, I dated someone 21... younger men are just more fun. I like their energy. I&#39;ve always been kind of young for my age.</p><p>I&#39;m enjoying dating. I&#39;m single, though, I&#39;m not in a relationship.</p><p>I grew up between the two world wars and received a rather solid general education, the kind middle class children enjoyed in a country whose educational system had its roots dating back to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</p><p>My original inspiration was my mom: a few years after the death of my dad, she started dating one my teachers!</p><p>I think a nice romantic dinner should be saved for when you and the girl you&#39;re dating or seeing have something special and it&#39;s a more special occasion.</p><p>Frankly, the reason I joined MENSA is because I was dating a guy at the time who spoke five languages and could solve a Rubik&#39;s Cube literally with his eyes closed because it&#39;s just an algorithm.</p><p>I don&#39;t talk about who I&#39;m dating because when you break up, you wind up reliving it in the media.</p><p>I&#39;m the one who&#39;s dating the craft-service guy instead of the producer. Plus, if a producer is going to date a hot young thing, I&#39;m probably not the first person on their list - the weird, quirky, funny girl.</p><p>I don&#39;t really talk about my personal life. It&#39;s a strange and funny and weird thing. Sometimes you have a conversation with someone and the paparazzi snaps a picture of you and people decide you&#39;re dating. If I try to answer everything people say, I would be up all night.</p><p>I was dating a guy that was a huge wrestling fan and I&#39;m embarrassed to say it now but I used to make fun of him for watching it.</p><p>I got that experience through dating dozens of men for six years after college, getting an entry level magazine job at 21, working in the fiction department at Good Housekeeping and then working as a fashion editor there as well as writing many articles for the magazine.</p><p>I&#39;m a bad dater - I&#39;m just not good at it. It&#39;s so weird dating in this town. It&#39;s like high school. I get a lot of people who have their publicist call my agent to ask, &#39;Is she dating anyone?&#39;</p><p>The Peking man was a thinking being, standing erect, dating to the beginning of the Ice Age.</p><p>A man who won&#39;t die for something is not fit to live.</p><p>To be idle is a short road to death and to be diligent is a way of life foolish people are idle, wise people are diligent.</p><p>The fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears, for there&#39;s no risk of accident for someone who&#39;s dead.</p><p>The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.</p><p>Death is no more than passing from one room into another. But there&#39;s a difference for me, you know. Because in that other room I shall be able to see.</p><p>What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.</p><p>I didn&#39;t attend the funeral, but I sent a nice letter saying I approved of it.</p><p>No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don&#39;t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life&#39;s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.</p><p>Our dead are never dead to us, until we have forgotten them.</p><p>While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die.</p><p>Life is hard. Then you die. Then they throw dirt in your face. Then the worms eat you. Be grateful it happens in that order.</p><p>Suicide is man&#39;s way of telling God, &#39;You can&#39;t fire me - I quit.&#39;</p><p>I saw few die of hunger of eating, a hundred thousand.</p><p>Death most resembles a prophet who is without honor in his own land or a poet who is a stranger among his people.</p><p>Let no one weep for me, or celebrate my funeral with mourning for I still live, as I pass to and fro through the mouths of men.</p><p>The life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living.</p><p>The day which we fear as our last is but the birthday of eternity.</p><p>Die, v.: To stop sinning suddenly.</p><p>A friend who dies, it&#39;s something of you who dies.</p><p>No one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow.</p><p>They tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice... that suicide is wrong when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.</p><p>I have never killed a man, but I have read many obituaries with great pleasure.</p><p>For death is no more than a turning of us over from time to eternity.</p><p>A dying man needs to die, as a sleepy man needs to sleep, and there comes a time when it is wrong, as well as useless, to resist.</p><p>Dying is easy, it&#39;s living that scares me to death.</p><p>Death will be a great relief. No more interviews.</p><p>I decided to devote my life to telling the story because I felt that having survived I owe something to the dead. and anyone who does not remember betrays them again.</p><p>I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.</p><p>I&#39;ve told my children that when I die, to release balloons in the sky to celebrate that I graduated. For me, death is a graduation.</p><p>Those who have the strength and the love to sit with a dying patient in the silence that goes beyond words will know that this moment is neither frightening nor painful, but a peaceful cessation of the functioning of the body.</p><p>Man always dies before he is fully born.</p><p>From my rotting body, flowers shall grow and I am in them and that is eternity.</p><p>When you&#39;re dead, you&#39;re dead. That&#39;s it.</p><p>I had seen birth and death but had thought they were different.</p><p>Death is a very dull, dreary affair, and my advice to you is to have nothing whatsoever to do with it.</p><p>Because of indifference, one dies before one actually dies.</p><p>Millions long for immortality who don&#39;t know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Call no man happy till he is dead.</p><p>Do not fear death so much but rather the inadequate life.</p><p>Cursed is the man who dies, but the evil done by him survives.</p><p>A man does not die of love or his liver or even of old age he dies of being a man.</p><p>Birth and death we all move between these two unknowns.</p><p>Some people are so afraid do die that they never begin to live.</p><p>Life is better than death, I believe, if only because it is less boring, and because it has fresh peaches in it.</p><p>To himself everyone is immortal he may know that he is going to die, but he can never know that he is dead.</p><p>Pale Death beats equally at the poor man&#39;s gate and at the palaces of kings.</p><p>Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased by tales, so is the other.</p><p>Since the day of my birth, my death began its walk.

I&#39;m a big fan of it.</p><p>It&#39;s certain that the death of an actor can be on a television screen playing the same thing every week.</p><p>In these dangerous times, where it seems the world is ripping apart at the seams, we can all learn how to survive from those who stare death squarely in the face every day, and we should reach out to each other and bond as a community, rather than hide from the terrors of life at the end of the millennium.</p><p>Between our birth and death we may touch understanding, As a moth brushes a window with its wing.</p><p>Washington, not Jefferson, freed his slaves upon his death.</p><p>There are some people who walk into a room and they oxygenate it, by their very being there&#39;s fresh air. Then there are those who come in with the smell of death and they suck the life out.</p><p>When we play &#39;Angel of Death&#39;, it&#39;s actually a 2 and half minutes sing &#39;til our party starts. That song is pretty much been played traditionally in the end.</p><p>Patrick Henry did not say, &#39;Give me absolutely safety or give me death.&#39; America is supposed to be about freedom.</p><p>Lots of people there seemed to be in denial, in absolute denial, of death - everybody&#39;s pretending that death doesn&#39;t happen in L.A. if you do enough exercise and take enough wheatgrass and have your pill every day, you might not die.</p><p>On the basis of biological, sociological, and historical knowledge, we should recognize that the individual self is subject to death or decay, but the sum total of individual achievement, for better or worse, lives on in the immortality of The Larger.</p><p>I just don&#39;t get death at all.

I just think it&#39;s a rumor.</p><p>I rely on guns for protection in life. God does not say, &#39;This is la-la land.&#39; God doesn&#39;t say, &#39;Welcome to Earth. Everything&#39;s perfect.

I&#39;m just grateful I&#39;m here.</p><p>I think about death a lot, I really do, because I can&#39;t believe I won&#39;t exist. It&#39;s the ego isn&#39;t it? I feel that I should retreat into a better form of Zen Buddhism than this kind of ego-dominated thing.

The label is always telling you, &#39;This ain&#39;t going to last,&#39; so I worked myself half to death. I learnt from that and I like to pace myself now.</p><p>Most of the debate over the cultures of death and life is about process. The debate focuses on the technology available to determine how we prolong life and how and when we end it.</p><p>If you think aficionados of a living Constitution want to bring you flexibility, think again. You think the death penalty is a good idea? Persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it. You want a right to abortion? Persuade your fellow citizens and enact it. That&#39;s flexibility.</p><p>Death is a very important part of life.</p><p>Not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia.

Every conceivable method was used to stop them from talking.</p><p>The death penalty is being applied in the United States as a fatal lottery.</p><p>I was in two episodes playing Christopher Reeve&#39;s character&#39;s emissary. They wanted to have my character announce Dr Swan&#39;s death, which I thought was exploitative.</p><p>Planning to play: that&#39;s what saving for retirement is today - and it is antithetical to the nature of play, fully within the definition of work, and blissfully ignorant of the reality of death.</p><p>I&#39;m not on the run from anything and I&#39;m not at all clear about what I&#39;m running towards. But as some great writer put it, I want to be certain that when I arrive at death, I&#39;m totally exhausted.</p><p>So here is one of my theories on happiness: we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end. This view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of Philip Gould. Philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics. When he died, I felt like I had lost a limb.</p><p>What we think of as our sensitivity is only the higher evolution of terror in a poor dumb beast. We suffer for nothing. Our own death wish is our only real tragedy.</p><p>I start thinking about life after death. I&#39;ve got to quit thinking about it because it&#39;s very deep. Very deep. Sometimes you start thinking about it, and you don&#39;t feel like you want to be alive, so I don&#39;t like to get all quiet.</p><p>When we are dealing with death we are constantly being dragged down by the event: Humor diverts our attention and lifts our sagging spirits.</p><p>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</p><p>You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.</p><p>The artist in me cries out for design.</p><p>A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</p><p>Sometimes I can&#39;t figure designers out. It&#39;s as if they flunked human anatomy.</p><p>Many things difficult to design prove easy to performance.</p><p>I would be most content if my children grew up to be the kind of people who think decorating consists mostly of building enough bookshelves.</p><p>Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that&#39;s why it is so complicated.</p><p>I don&#39;t design clothes, I design dreams.</p><p>Designers are very fickle. I never wanted to be a victim of that. You&#39;re in one minute, out the next.</p><p>Good design is good business.</p><p>Design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all... good design must primarily serve people.</p><p>The urge for good design is the same as the urge to go on living.</p><p>It is only after years of preparation that the young artist should touch color - not color used descriptively, that is, but as a means of personal expression.</p><p>Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.</p><p>Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal While others, on the contrary, obtain a victory by exerting, at the last moment, more vigorous efforts than ever before.</p><p>The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line.</p><p>Sacred spaces can be created in any environment.</p><p>Design works if it&#39;s authentic, inspired, and has a clear point of view. It can&#39;t be a collection of input.</p><p>Perhaps believing in good design is like believing in God, it makes you an optimist.</p><p>Delay always breeds danger and to protract a great design is often to ruin it.</p><p>Luck is the residue of design.</p><p>Color does not add a pleasant quality to design - it reinforces it.</p><p>Good buildings come from good people, ad all problems are solved by good design.</p><p>I design for real people. I think of our customers all the time. There is no virtue whatsoever in creating clothing or accessories that are not practical.</p><p>Recognizing the need is the primary condition for design.</p><p>Design is not making beauty, beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love.</p><p>Every contrivance of man, every tool, every instrument, every utensil, every article designed for use, of each and every kind, evolved from a very simple beginnings.</p><p>Design is not for philosophy it&#39;s for life.</p><p>About half my designs are controlled fantasy, 15 percent are total madness and the rest are bread-and-butter designs.</p><p>To whom does design address itself: to the greatest number, to the specialist of an enlightened matter, to a privileged social class? Design addresses itself to the need.</p><p>This is what I like about being a designer: You can&#39;t really get it until you see it.</p><p>To design the future effectively, you must first let go of your past.</p><p>When I design buildings, I think of the overall composition, much as the parts of a body would fit together. On top of that, I think about how people will approach the building and experience that space.</p><p>A good designer must rely on experience, on precise, logic thinking and on pedantic exactness. No magic will do.</p><p>Design is everything. Everything!</p><p>I like the body. I like to design everything to do with the body.</p><p>The primary factor is proportions.</p><p>I design for the woman who loves being a woman.</p><p>Good design doesn&#39;t date.</p><p>I think it&#39;s really important to design things with a kind of personality.</p><p>Accessible design is good design.</p><p>In my opinion, no single design is apt to be optimal for everyone.</p><p>The proper study of mankind is the science of design.</p><p>So, to really execute design in its highest form and making people feel joy, that&#39;s a great reward.</p><p>I think there is a new awareness in this 21st century that design is as important to where and how we live as it is for museums, concert halls and civic buildings.</p><p>What is design? It&#39;s where you stand with a foot in two worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the two together.</p><p>Design is people.</p><p>A designer is only as good as the star who wears her clothes.</p><p>The design of each element should be thought out in order to be easy to make and easy to repair.</p><p>I don&#39;t start with a design objective, I start with a communication objective. I feel my project is successful if it communicates what it is supposed to communicate.</p><p>I would think twice about designing stuff for which there was no need and which didn&#39;t endure.</p><p>Design is an unknown.</p><p>Designs of purely arbitrary nature cannot be expected to last long.</p><p>Outside of the chair, the teapot is the most ubiquitous and important design element in the domestic environment and almost everyone who has tackled the world of design has ended up designing one.</p><p>To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master.</p><p>Great designers seldom make great advertising men, because they get overcome by the beauty of the picture - and forget that merchandise must be sold.</p><p>Design is directed toward human beings. To design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the best solution.</p><p>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future it is something you design for the present.</p><p>If you don&#39;t design your own life plan, chances are you&#39;ll fall into someone else&#39;s plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.</p><p>A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.</p><p>A lot of people in our industry haven&#39;t had very diverse experiences. So they don&#39;t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one&#39;s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.</p><p>Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it&#39;s really how it works.</p><p>If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life.</p><p>Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.</p><p>In most people&#39;s vocabularies, design means veneer. It&#39;s interior decorating. It&#39;s the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.</p><p>The design of the Mac wasn&#39;t what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it&#39;s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.</p><p>I paint mostly from real life. It has to start with that. Real people, real street scenes, behind the curtain scenes, live models, paintings, photographs, staged setups, architecture, grids, graphic design. Whatever it takes to make it work.</p><p>Since when has the world of computer software design been about what people want? This is a simple question of evolution. The day is quickly coming when every knee will bow down to a silicon fist, and you will all beg your binary gods for mercy.</p><p>In giving us children, God places us in a position of both leadership and service. He calls us to give up our lives for someone else&#39;s sake - to abandon our own desires and put our child&#39;s interests first. Yet, according to His perfect design, it is through this selflessness that we can become truly fulfilled.</p><p>Let it be your constant method to look into the design of people&#39;s actions, and see what they would be at, as often as it is practicable and to make this custom the more significant, practice it first upon yourself.</p><p>The computer can&#39;t tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact mathematical design, but what&#39;s missing is the eyebrows.</p><p>I always consider the settlement of America with reverence and wonder, as the opening of a grand scene and design in providence, for the illumination of the ignorant and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the earth.</p><p>The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.</p><p>A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible. There are no prima donnas in engineering.</p><p>Obviously, I come from one background, and the people that design fitness equipment have been doing it for years and years, and they know what works and doesn&#39;t work.</p><p>As all human beings are, in my view, creatures of God&#39;s design, we must respect all other human beings. That does not mean I have to agree with their choices or agree with their opinions, but indeed I respect them as human beings.</p><p>Books are but waste paper unless we spend in action the wisdom we get from thought - asleep. When we are weary of the living, we may repair to the dead, who have nothing of peevishness, pride, or design in their conversation.</p><p>Though men are apt to flatter and exalt themselves with their great achievements, yet these are, in truth, very often owing not so much to design as chance.</p><p>I did not direct my life. I didn&#39;t design it. I never made decisions. Things always came up and made them for me. That&#39;s what life is.</p><p>Almost all quality improvement comes via simplification of design, manufacturing... layout, processes, and procedures.</p><p>Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that&#39;s because the designer himself, the engineer, is explained by natural selection.</p><p>Designing is my hobby. If I didn&#39;t do what I do for a living - at some point when I don&#39;t do this for a living - I&#39;ll probably just do design work. I love finding really special pieces of furniture.</p><p>An image is not simply a trademark, a design, a slogan or an easily remembered picture. It is a studiously crafted personality profile of an individual, institution, corporation, product or service.</p><p>Graphic design is the paradise of individuality, eccentricity, heresy, abnormality, hobbies and humors.</p><p>Art has to move you and design does not, unless it&#39;s a good design for a bus.</p><p>We must look for ways to be an active force in our own lives. We must take charge of our own destinies, design a life of substance and truly begin to live our dreams.</p><p>I really see myself continuing to design clothes, fragrances.</p><p>At the University of Maryland, my first year I started off planning to major in art because I was interested in theatre design, stage design or television design.</p><p>How can you look at the Texas legislature and still believe in intelligent design?</p><p>Design in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements in the creative flux. You can&#39;t invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes.</p><p>Good design begins with honesty, asks tough questions, comes from collaboration and from trusting your intuition.</p><p>I don&#39;t act, I don&#39;t direct, I don&#39;t design.</p><p>A purpose, an intention, a design, strikes everywhere even the careless, the most stupid thinker.</p><p>All architecture is shelter, all great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space.</p><p>The only thing Martha and I have in common is that we both used to model. Martha Stewart is extremely talented. Her designs are picture perfect. Our philosophy is life is messy, and rather than being afraid of those messes we design products that work the way we live.</p><p>Engineering, medicine, business, architecture and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent - not with how things are but with how they might be - in short, with design.</p><p>I&#39;m a total control freak and love to participate in the design of every single aspect of life.</p><p>When I design a wedding dress with a bustle, it has to be one the bride can dance in. I love the idea that something is practical and still looks great.</p><p>Gaming in general is a male thing. It isn&#39;t that gaming is designed to exclude women. Everybody who&#39;s tried to design a game to interest a large female audience has failed. And I think that has to do with the different thinking processes of men and women.</p><p>The actual tragedies of life bear no relation to one&#39;s preconceived ideas. In the event, one is always bewildered by their simplicity, their grandeur of design, and by that element of the bizarre which seems inherent in them.</p><p>At some point in your life, if you&#39;re lucky, you get to design the way in which things evolve.</p><p>It&#39;s all in how you arrange the thing... the careful balance of the design is the motion.</p><p>I was very interested in theatre, mostly in stage design. I did a little bit of acting.</p><p>We thought it would be fun to try to design a show that would work well internationally and so that&#39; s what we&#39;re intending to do with Fraggle Rock, and we are indeed now selling it around the world.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, I have noticed that the most flexible, dynamic, inquisitive minds among my students have been industrial design majors. Industrial designers are bracingly free of ideology and cant. The industrial designer is trained to be a clear-eyed observer of the commercial world - which, like it or not, is modern reality.</p><p>I have always had an interest in fashion and design and I appreciate style and timelessness within my footwear and accessories both on and off the court.</p><p>I tried a dozen different modifications that were rejected. But they all served as a path to the final design.</p><p>Summer blockbusters are very expensive to make. They have things that have to be expensive, such as 600 effects shots or CG characters that have to go a certain way, or a film design that is different but expensive.</p><p>I&#39;m not really a fashion designer. I just love clothes. I&#39;ve never been to design school. I can&#39;t sketch. I can&#39;t cut patterns and things. I can shorten things. I can make a dress out of a scarf.</p><p>I help design my own tennis clothes.</p><p>Ever since I was young I loved making things and being part of the design process.</p><p>All those years of skating and dancing have carried over. I can&#39;t design anything without thinking of how a woman&#39;s body will look and move when she&#39;s wearing it.</p><p>Design is about point of view, and there should be some sort of woman or lifestyle or attitude in one&#39;s head as a designer.</p><p>The design of Rhetoric is to remove those Prejudices that lie in the way of Truth, to Reduce the Passions to the Government of Reasons to place our Subject in a Right Light, and excite our Hearers to a due consideration of it.</p><p>Interior design is a business of trust.</p><p>People who run a ready-to-wear company are businessmen rather than production or design people.</p><p>You can be a mason and build 50 buildings, but it doesn&#39;t mean you can design one.</p><p>I like design, I like details, to me it is just another form of self-expression.</p><p>Well, I design costumes because I started with the theater in Chicago, but somehow a few lines just sort of fell to me to do it. And I studied it in school and I always liked it.</p><p>Let&#39;s be realistic, how many people are buying a $2,000 skirt? I love to design things that people can actually buy. I&#39;m staggered by what a boot costs today.</p><p>While a case can be made for intelligent design, I can&#39;t figure out why some Christians are so thrilled about that possibility. First of all, it doesn&#39;t prove there&#39;s a God. If anything, intelligent design lends support to some form of pantheism that defines God as immanent within nature.</p><p>I come from a different era and I design clothes for our era. I think of people I want to dress when I design.</p><p>Now I design what I want to wear, and it works that way.</p><p>I can design a collection in a day and I always do, cause I&#39;ve always got a load of Italians on my back, moaning that it&#39;s late.</p><p>After 1980, you never heard reference to space again. Surface, the most convincing evidence of the descent into materialism, became the focus of design. Space disappeared.</p><p>No wonder the film industry started in the desert in California where, like all desert dwellers, they dream their buildings, rather than design them.</p><p>My style is kind of eclectic and I don&#39;t like to do the same thing over and over again. I like to have fun and explore myself so you won&#39;t see the same design.</p><p>The principle of the design - the harmony, rhythm and balance are all the same with interior and fashion design.</p><p>But, alas! what poor Woman is ever taught that she should have a higher Design than to get her a Husband?</p><p>I like the gritty parts of fashion, the design, the studio, the pictures.</p><p>Book-jacket design may become a lost art, like album-cover design, without which late-20th-century iconography would have been pauperized.</p><p>Design is important, it&#39;s an important dimension in the car. It&#39;s not the only one.</p><p>Music is where I have the most creative freedom, but I love producing. To me, that&#39;s kind of where all the action is. You get a chance to have your hands in every aspect of a film. From picking a director, sometimes picking a writer, to the actors, the wardrobe, set design, editing, music, and marketing.</p><p>A person should design the way he makes a living around how he wishes to make a life.</p><p>That was always my frustration with so many of these shows, because design is not an ambush... it&#39;s a relationship. You have to know how people move and live and work to be able to design for them.</p><p>The Japanese have a wonderful sense of design and a refinement in their art. They try to produce beautiful paintings with the minimum number of strokes.</p><p>It would have been difficult to design a path out of communism worse than the one that has been followed.</p><p>Can you design a Rorschach test that&#39;s going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test? It&#39;s easy to show a picture of a kitten or a car accident. The question is, how abstract can you get and still get the audience to feel something when they don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to them?</p><p>All those lessons that I&#39;ve learned on the court, I have applied them to my life outside of the court in business, my company, called V Starr interiors, an interior design company, and EleVen, which I wear on court.</p><p>I love design.</p><p>I&#39;d love to design bridal dresses.</p><p>I thank Marc Jacobs so much for giving me the opportunity to design a shoe for Louis Vuitton, but the thing that broke my heart most was when they said, &#39;You&#39;re finished. The shoe&#39;s finished.&#39;</p><p>So, I&#39;m always around video games but I&#39;ve always been interested in them from a visual perspective, with the graphic design and that whole thing. I don&#39;t know if that comes from my love of photography or what but that&#39;s always what&#39;s held my interest about them.</p><p>When I design and wonder what the point is, I think of someone having a bad time in their life. Maybe they are sad and they wake up and put on something I have made and it makes them feel just a bit better. So, in that sense, fashion is a little help in the life of a person. But only a little.</p><p>I mean, I think about it, but I don&#39;t design my record to get a certain public response.</p><p>Marc Jacobs is full of creative people and Louis Vuitton is again a name on the door, a name that has existed for many years but I&#39;m a collaborator there and I bring in other people, other artists and I work with a great creative design team.</p><p>But I&#39;m blessed to work with great people. I collaborate with brilliant stylists both here and in Paris. I work with a great design team. I really allow everyone to bring their ideas. I almost rely on them to inspire me.</p><p>I approve designs not because I think I am more gifted or somebody who can see ahead three or four years from now, but just to make sure that the design is a logical, rational decision, taken after analyzing pros and cons.</p><p>When I come to a design decision, people know that is that.</p><p>For me, unemployment and poverty in the Greater Montreal area is not mainly a problem of structure, or design, or statistics. It is a profoundly human situation.</p><p>Pete Dye introduced me to golf course design back in the 1960&#39;s. He came to my hometown Columbus, Ohio to work on The Golf Club.</p><p>I&#39;ve wanted to design golf courses ever since I was a kid. I suppose it comes from the way I&#39;ve played the game. To find the proper way to play any hole, I&#39;ve always begun by asking myself what the architect has tried to do with it.</p><p>A Nicklaus Design golf course is done by the guys in my company that I work with, that have been trained in my vision, and they do what they think I might do. They might come in the office and ask me questions and I&#39;d certainly answer their questions, but I&#39;m not involved in the site visits or anything else.</p><p>A jellyfish is little more than a pulsating bell, a tassel of trailing tentacles and a single digestive opening through which it both eats and excretes - as regrettable an example of economy of design as ever was.</p><p>Leopard is an animal design, and my designs come from nature.</p><p>I became an art major, took every art class my school had to offer. In college, I majored in Advertising Art and Design.</p><p>Britain&#39;s great strength is its innovative, design and engineering natural ability and we&#39;re not using it.</p><p>I don&#39;t design down to a price.</p><p>I&#39;m not into politics but I am committed to a cause: ensuring design technology and engineering stays on the U.K. curriculum, alongside science and maths - grounding abstract theory, merging the practical with the academic.</p><p>When you say &#39;design,&#39; everybody thinks of magazine pages. So it&#39;s an emotive word. Everybody thinks it&#39;s how something looks, whereas for me, design is pretty much everything.</p><p>I don&#39;t particularly follow the Bauhaus school of design, where you make everything into a black box - simplify it.</p><p>Design and technology should be the subject where mathematical brainboxes and science whizzkids turn their bright ideas into useful products.</p><p>Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose.</p><p>The details are not the details. They make the design.</p><p>I think fashion is a lot of fun. I love clothes. More than fashion or brand labels, I love design. I love the thought that people put into clothes. I love when clothes make cultural statements and I think personal style is really cool. I also freely recognize that fashion should be a hobby.</p><p>I&#39;d like to design something like a city or a museum. I want to do something hands on rather than just play golf which is the sport of the religious right.</p><p>I&#39;m drawn to furniture design as complete architecture on a minor scale.</p><p>McSweeney&#39;s as a publishing company is built on a business model that only works when we sell physical books. So we try to put a lot of effort into the design and production of the book-as-object.</p><p>When I announced the development of Perl 6, I said it was going to be a community design. I designed Perl, myself. It&#39;s limited by my own brain power. So I wanted Perl 6 to be a community design.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been a bit of a decorator. I think if I wasn&#39;t a singer I&#39;d probably be in stage setting or interior design or something. I like clutter and I&#39;m quite visually greedy. I can&#39;t have things to be plain I have to have things looking interesting... maybe I&#39;m just a frustrated interior designer stuck in a singing career.</p><p>I think a lot of times people design restaurants with flash in mind. I think you should design restaurants with function in mind. Make sure it&#39;s functional and works with what you&#39;re trying to accomplish. Design can come later.</p><p>Design is so critical it should be on the agenda of every meeting in every single department.</p><p>I am a fashion designer. I&#39;m not an environmentalist. When I get up in the morning, number one I&#39;m a mother and a wife, and number two I design clothes. So the main thing I need to do is create, hopefully, exquisitely beautiful, desirable objects for my customer.</p><p>Complexity is one of the great problems in environmental design.</p><p>Once you understand this way, you will be able to make your room alive you will be able to design a house together with your family a garden for your children places where you can work beautiful terraces where you can sit and dream.</p><p>We worked with the engineers in the design and construction and testing phases in those various areas, then we would get back together at the end of the week and brief each other as to what had gone on.</p><p>The level of detail and craft is something that&#39;s inscribed within the original design concept. And so when I begin to draw, I know what kind of detailing I want the building to have.</p><p>Web users ultimately want to get at data quickly and easily. They don&#39;t care as much about attractive sites and pretty design.</p><p>People tell you the world looks a certain way. Parents tell you how to think. Schools tell you how to think. TV. Religion. And then at a certain point, if you&#39;re lucky, you realize you can make up your own mind. Nobody sets the rules but you. You can design your own life.</p><p>Luckily I don&#39;t have to buy shoes anymore, because I design them! I&#39;m off tour, so I can dive in and create the shoes that I want for my line. But okay, I did buy a pair of vintage combat boots because they were so beaten up - I had to have them.</p><p>When we were in the design studio I always was pretending like I was in a closet asking my friend before I step out into the world what do I look like? And everybody wants that honest friend before they go and go to dinner or go to an event.</p><p>I am extremely involved in the design process of both my brands, Winter Kate and House of Harlow 1960.</p><p>What I&#39;ve learned from different designers is that it&#39;s key to be true to who you are and your vision. That&#39;s always been my line of thinking. Working through the whole design process, I don&#39;t want to create something I wouldn&#39;t be proud to wear.</p><p>I learn my lines while on the golf course. I try to do two or three things at once. I have ideas for books all the time, I have ideas for paintings all the time, and I write them all down. I take my sketchpad and my iPad, which I design on, and I do sit down and do specific tasks at specific times.</p><p>The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there&#39;s a single numeric average. But if it&#39;s a design or something that matters, the decision is made by committee, and that&#39;s crap. You want people and groups who are able to think thoughts before they share.</p><p>The basic problem is that web 2.0 tools are not supportive of democracy by design. They are tools designed to gather spy-agency-like data in a seductive way, first and foremost, but as a side effect they tend to provide software support for mob-like phenomena.</p><p>In architecture the idea degenerated. Design allows a more direct and pleasurable route.</p><p>I&#39;m opinionated. I always stick to my design plan. I don&#39;t waver.</p><p>There is no city in America that has reduced crime as much as we have in the last three years. This is not the product of accident. This is the product of design.</p><p>To be able to design for the plus-sized consumer, for me, that&#39;s just beyond. It&#39;s a dream.</p><p>I was a cartoonist when I was at university, but I decided to go into movie making knowing that I could still draw by doing movies, design work, story boards, and such.</p><p>In just six weeks from the time the design was started, we had the motor on the block testing its power.</p><p>Everyone wants an iPhone, but it would be impossible to design an iPhone in China because it&#39;s not a product it&#39;s an understanding of human nature.</p><p>I see the Beijing National Stadium as an architectural project. I accepted Herzog and De Meuron&#39;s invitation to collaborate on the design, and our proposal won the competition. From beginning to end, I stayed with the project. I am committed to fostering relationships between a city and its architecture.</p><p>If you only design menus that are essentially junk or fast food, the whole infrastructure supports junk.</p><p>God is His own Design and End, and that there is no other Worthy of Him.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had anyone define purity. You probably can&#39;t define purity. Purity is to live according to original design.</p><p>I&#39;d like to do a lot of things - whether in design or architecture or business.</p><p>I studied literature design and fashion design.</p><p>Design, in its broadest sense, is the enabler of the digital era - it&#39;s a process that creates order out of chaos, that renders technology usable to business. Design means being good, not just looking good.</p><p>I majored in fashion design in school, and I have always wanted to design my own line of clothing, jewelry, and stuff like that so this was just a step for me in that direction.</p><p>We should always look upon ourselves as God&#39;s servants, placed in God&#39;s world, to do his work and accordingly labour faithfully for him not with a design to grow rich and great, but to glorify God, and do all the good we possibly can.</p><p>Our guiding principle was that design is neither an intellectual nor a material affair, but simply an integral part of the stuff of life, necessary for everyone in a civilized society.</p><p>Organisms by their design are not made to adapt too far.</p><p>Species go extinct because there are historical contraints built into a given body or a given design.</p><p>The garden, by design, is concerned with both the interior and the land beyond the garden.</p><p>French architecture always manages to combine the most magnificent underlying themes of architecture like Roman design, it looks to the community.</p><p>Italy is full of historical buildings. And Europe holds a great history of philosophy from Greece until today. I read all those books and see these buildings, and I think of where I stand when I design my architecture.</p><p>All those involved in the construction of an architectural design, from the architect to the builder, have an attachment to the architecture, although it&#39;s difficult to quantify the attachment.</p><p>Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable.</p><p>Design can have such a positive impact on the way people live and on their relationships and moods.</p><p>Design my own line? No, I just like the culture.</p><p>I have an all-Japanese design team, and none of them speak English. So it&#39;s often funny and surprising how my ideas end up lost in translation.</p><p>It would be nice to design a real briefcase - you open it up and it&#39;s your computer but it also stores your books.</p><p>If I designed a computer with 200 chips, I tried to design it with 150. And then I would try to design it with 100. I just tried to find every trick I could in life to design things real tiny.</p><p>No one who set out to design a form of communication would ever end up with anything like English, Mandarin, or any of the more than six thousand languages spoken today.</p><p>I am always locked in my design studio.</p><p>It&#39;s funny now how much we look at - whatever you want to call it: art, design, culture stuff, film - online, and how in the online world, you&#39;re instantly global.</p><p>I actually started as a model builder and quickly progressed into production design, which made sense because I could draw and paint. But I kept watching that guy over there who was moving the actors around and setting up the shots.</p><p>I&#39;m not a size 0, and I&#39;m nowhere close to it. But, I don&#39;t want anyone to know what I am so I like to design clothes so you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on under there.</p><p>I can&#39;t design anything unless I&#39;m excited by it, meaning I have an urge to wear it.</p><p>Martha Stewart is extremely talented. Her designs are picture perfect. Our philosophy is life is messy, and rather than being afraid of those messes we design products that work the way we live.</p><p>I won&#39;t give up my day job of design.</p><p>They say that the best furniture and clothing design from the &#39;50s and &#39;60s is Scandinavian or Milanese.</p><p>French design hardly exists, except as artificial modernism.</p><p>For me, I am still very happy to be able to do stage design as it&#39;s an opportunity to express the extreme.</p><p>The architect, Peter Arens who is the monstrous carbuncle architect, not merely did his design which had won a public competition never get built but his practice suffered financially for some years.</p><p>Design is a word that&#39;s come to mean so much that it&#39;s also a word that has come to mean nothing.</p><p>You can get a lot of design testing of your missile program, and you can do a lot of - there&#39;s other ways other than physically to develop your weaponization program to get you very close to the real deal.</p><p>The gays like &#39;Project Runway&#39; because it&#39;s a fashion, and the gays are into fashion and into design. It&#39;s a creative industry, and most of the gays are pretty creative, in general. That&#39;s just like the culture. We&#39;re not all into politics necessarily. We&#39;re more into the creative environment. I also think Heidi is a big draw. The boys love Heidi and think she&#39;s so fabulous. I just think it&#39;s a glitzy, fun show, and there are also always lots of gay boys on it, and, you know, that&#39;s fun.</p><p>The industry&#39;s changed so much that you can&#39;t just design something, put on a great show, and say, &#39;Okay, my job is done.&#39;</p><p>User-centered design means understanding what your users need, how they think, and how they behave - and incorporating that understanding into every aspect of your process.</p><p>After the Great Depression and after public urging, a nationwide public competition was held to determine a design for a memorial that would honor President Thomas Jefferson&#39;s bold vision for westward expansion for America.</p><p>I design for myself and the first question I ask is, &#39;Would I wear it?&#39;</p><p>I&#39;ve never mentioned this, but when I was at Parsons teaching, the other design disciplines, they don&#39;t like fashion design. They see it as very nineteenth-century.</p><p>With fashion, you really need to understand the aspects of construction. Not just design on an iPad.</p><p>Although my art work was heavily informed by my design work on a formal and visual level, as regards meaning and content the two practices parted ways.</p><p>When I was very, very young, seven years old, I heard there was school where you could go to learn to draw. That was my absolute driven passion, to become an artist or a painter. So the romantic realist in me, I studied to be a graphic design artist and an art teacher.</p><p>I had a faux-hawk for a while and I used to buzz the sides and design it. It was really bad.</p><p>I have never seen a game&#39;s graphics look so sharp and clean. The sound design for the game is also unique on the Xbox. The memory on this system allowed us to provide the user with 5.1 Dolby surround sound for home theatre owners.</p><p>I have a secret thought from some things I have observed, that God may perhaps design you for some singular service in the world.</p><p>In regards to being a fashion aficionado, there&#39;s a certain amount of taking yourself seriously in the professional world. The self-effacing person can&#39;t completely go down the serious road. But I design, and love when things are beautiful.</p><p>So that ideas of sort of relaxed symmetry have been something for years that I have been concerned with because I think that symmetry is a neutral shape as opposed to a form of design.</p><p>But active programming consists of the design of new programs, rather than contemplation of old programs.</p><p>Clearly, programming courses should teach methods of design and construction, and the selected examples should be such that a gradual development can be nicely demonstrated.</p><p>I have been wildly enthused about gaming since I was younger, and a career path I chose not to go down but did really consider was getting into programming and game design.</p><p>I write the way you might arrange flowers. Not every try works, but each one launches another. Every constraint, even dullness, frees up a new design.</p><p>There are two kinds of designers: ones who are very happy locked in their office surrounded by their coterie. The last thing they need to do is to go to a trunk show they&#39;d go running for the hills. I not only enjoy it, I think, how do you design things that are applicable to life - unless you live it?</p><p>People kind of tend to mystify design and architecture by suggesting you need to train.</p><p>Well, I never studied design and I went to art school to study art, you know, sculpture and things like that, and ended up making things like sculpture and started making chairs and jewelry together and that&#39;s how I started.</p><p>Design schools are good, I guess, sometimes I visit schools, but they are very very limiting.</p><p>So if I design it and then go away, it&#39;s still living somewhere and it still exists by itself without me.</p><p>So if I want to buy a light in a shop and I don&#39;t find a light that I like, I think to myself what would I like? What would I like to buy? Then I started to imagine and design it for myself a lot of the time.</p><p>I think it is really important to have a sense of business. As a designer you can get so wrapped up in the design and fashion side that you forget the business side.</p><p>Websites are kind of useless. There&#39;s so much great web content and design out there, but the ways in which they are being experienced are not being maximized.</p><p>If you were the first person ever to design an application for the iPhone and you patented it, you would be very, very better off than we are right now, you know? But you&#39;ve got to be the first one to do it. So I figured that Led Zeppelin or the Stones were going to do it unless we just got on to it. So I got cracking with the guys from Apple.</p><p>After working with clothes for so long, it seemed right to design them.</p><p>The reward is that you can actually create a world separate from reality with a story, actors, music, and camera design. When it works it can entertain, move people and teach us all.</p><p>I am extremely excited to develop and design a brand representative of my life, experiences and style.

They have really good writers, production design, lighting, wardrobe.</p><p>We are not inferring design to account for a black box, but to account for an open box.</p><p>It&#39;s about the power of design and the power of the human spirit. It&#39;s above paying anybody to do something stupid for money like reality television does - like ambushing people.</p><p>I think taking design out of the studio and really having a relationship with the people that you&#39;re making it for really convinced me of how powerful a thing design is. It&#39;s not just an aesthetic decoration.</p><p>One of the best animated films I&#39;ve seen come out of Disney was the Tarzan movie. I wasn&#39;t crazy about the story or the design on Tarzan&#39;s face, but the traditional animation was spectacular.</p><p>I was in college, and very disappointed. I majored in commercial art and interior design for three or four years. At that time, it seemed the thing I really wanted to do, production design, just wasn&#39;t available in the U.K., so I turned to music.</p><p>I like to think that the Internet and file sharing, if utilized properly and embraced, and I emphasize properly, is a high-powered marketing design.</p><p>I wanted to be a decorator. I wanted to interior design homes and do everything myself.</p><p>Through the harsh design of fate, Florida was dealt the unfortunate circumstances of bearing the brunt of not one but two hurricanes, and it appears more dark clouds are poised to visit the Sunshine State.</p><p>Just as predatory animals follow a similar general design and behave in similar ways, so organizations, especially those in competition with one another, must follow certain design principles if they are to succeed and prevail.</p><p>Ultimately we may still ask, why can&#39;t humans design a perfect society?</p><p>To nourish children and raise them against odds is in any time, any place, is more valuable than to fix bolts in cars or design nuclear weapons.</p><p>And then, build a bustling wonderful city of the 21st century, with a restoration of a spectacular skyline, which Manhattan, of course, needs. So, that is really the design as a whole.</p><p>For me, if I can design beautiful things that have the price be lower, I am thrilled.</p><p>You can design a mortgage system that is different without a Fannie and Freddie, but there are principles you have to have, to have a good system.</p><p>Traditional horizontal search engines cannot always identify the target audience, niche or vertical industry of a page or site. Vertical search engines address this issue by the nature of their design. They identify sites according to more specific criteria and sometimes even by human input.</p><p>Even as a young boy, my passion was to design, and I have been very lucky to be able to do what I have loved all my life. There can be few greater gifts than that.</p><p>I like the personality of the Belgians. They&#39;re deeply eccentric, which is something that comes across in their design - terrific.</p><p>I am persuaded, that if any attempt is made to improve the education of the poor, and such an unmanly spirit should guide the resolution of a society or committee for that purpose, it would render the design abortive.</p><p>I think gardens are fantastic, and I&#39;d love to draw and design and stuff like that. I love just planting flowers during the summer. There&#39;s something very humble about it, and natural and beautiful.</p><p>Three years ago the Government announced the creation of Reconciliation Place, and said that it would include a memorial to those removed from their families. However, they refused to include any of those who were removed in the design of their own memorial.</p><p>In its report, the Cox Committee concludes that China is using stolen U.S. design information to speed up its deployment of a new nuclear missile force.</p><p>The United States government first learned of the diversion of the W-88 nuclear warhead design in late 1995.</p><p>That&#39;s a hobby of mine - to do whatever I can for unusual for-hire creative projects. I am waiting for someone to really challenge me - obviously I&#39;m often approached to do film related work, but I would be very happy to design a bar or an amusement park ride. I would love to be an imagineer!</p><p>I do love DVD and I&#39;ve always taken them seriously. You know, on the Austin things, we really put a ton of work into them because there&#39;s so much design involved. And in this one, we thought a lot about it and what could go in.</p><p>My biggest role as director on the film is keeping a sense of the overview - how to cast the movie and shoot it in such a way that it will cut together. And how to design the style and tone.</p><p>Through no divine design or cosmic plan, we have inherited the mantle of life&#39;s caretaker on the earth, the only home we have ever known.</p><p>No architect troubled to design houses that suited people who were to live in them, because that would have meant building a whole range of different houses.

That is when you start working on the solution of the gag, which is composition, placing, equilibrium, and character design.</p><p>In two days, it&#39;s hard to to get the quality you would normally want for a design project.</p><p>I look at each episode in two ways - from a design standpoint and from an entertainment standpoint - this is TV, after all. We usually succeed on at least one of the levels.</p><p>Throughout the country, I see the same design problems and solutions over and over.</p><p>I gave the couple a hint of a design that would work great with the bones of their home. They weren&#39;t ready for it, and they embarrassed themselves and that&#39;s too bad.</p><p>Being in the design industry, I&#39;ve tended to meet more people who are affected by HIV and AIDS.</p><p>The Final Jeopardy! questions seem to be, by design, things you can&#39;t know.

At this time, the aircraft was completely secret. I first knew of the existence of this aircraft only early in &#39;42 - even in my position. This aircraft didn&#39;t have any priority in design or production.</p><p>Longhorns are unique - each and every one of them is a different color with a different design.</p><p>I design my shots.

Each room should have something unique and different about it - much the same way that in a song, every eight bars or so, a new piece of information should be introduced.</p><p>Computers are scary. They&#39;re nightmares to fix, lose our stuff, and, on occasion, they crash, producing the blue screen of death. Steve Jobs knew this. He knew that computers were bulky and hernia-inducing and Darth Vader black. He understood the value of declarative design.</p><p>It was something I was more interested in myself. When I went to see my sister dance at ballet, I was really into costumes and the arts, and my family was also supportive of whatever me and my sister wanted to do. I would say I pushed myself the most to be into design.</p><p>So I went for engineering, specifically product design, which I enjoyed.</p><p>When I started this project, I was a young architect. I was very apprehensive about any changes to the design. Whether I wanted to or not, I learned that you can accept some changes to its form without compromising its intent. But it&#39;s a leap of faith that I didn&#39;t want to make initially - to put it mildly.</p><p>For two years nobody talked about anything other than the name arrangement. There was no fund-raising and no progress being made on construction and design.</p><p>How do you design it so that people can form a space of their own, and feel quiet and contemplative?</p><p>I really appreciate artists of the 20th century, and I can see a lot of their influence on my work, but to suggest that my design only fits within an &#39;ism&#39; kind of bothers me.</p><p>I used to design for my body, which was flat-chested with big hips. That&#39;s why my clothes were tight on top with full skirts.</p><p>We have no general conceptual thrust for the band, other than trying to make music that keeps our interest. When things are novel, they are probably things we have discovered by accident or investigation rather than by design.</p><p>Initially, it was the unpractical in fashion that brought me to design my own line. I felt that it was much more attractive to cut clothes with respect for the living, three-dimensional body rather than to cover the body with decorative ideas.</p><p>I think there is always a need for pure design.

Rhythm, sound design, heartfelt emotion - all in one place.</p><p>In any case, his judgment and set of values, acting alone or through his assistants, determine not only what is gold and what is dross but the design of the history which he creates out of the metal. The historian decides what is significant, and what is not.</p><p>I don&#39;t design cars. I&#39;m not a designer.

I know, sounds a bit over the top. But I&#39;m not as bad as I used to be.

It hardens the arteries and runs up our health-care costs. The last thing a poor person can afford is a heart attack or cancer or a stroke. And that&#39;s all linked to a meat-based diet. I think animal liberation is human liberation.;Ingrid Newkirk;diet 14888;Look at the average American diet: ice cream, butter, cheese, whole milk, all this fat.

I am on a strict diet, which is kind of hard to keep up with on the road, but I stick to it as well as I can.</p><p>By learning about my body and making small, subtle changes, I find out what I enjoy and what is effective.

You have to figure out which exercises are fun and interesting and stimulate your brain - or else you&#39;ll never keep at them.</p><p>If you eat a lot of starchy foods, introduce a vegetable once a week, then twice a week, and then three times a week.

It puts enormous pressure on the world&#39;s resources. A vegetarian diet is better.</p><p>I&#39;ve had weight issues all my life. I&#39;ve been on all the diets: Atkins, liquid protein, Scarsdale diet. Now I go to the gym often. I&#39;m always on the StairMaster, and I do weights.</p><p>I&#39;ve done every diet there is.</p><p>I&#39;ve never followed a vegan or vegetarian diet in the past, but I think I could do it. It would not be easy. I have worked with nutritionists who have said a vegan diet is not necessarily all positive for your health, because you need nutrients you only find in meats. I believe in a balanced diet.</p><p>We talk about, you know, diet and that we shouldn&#39;t give our kids big things and obesity and fast food. Well, you know there are people who don&#39;t have that problem because they&#39;re not getting any food! We have so many deep problems and issues facing humanity.</p><p>My parents have been incredibly supportive from perhaps the first real independent decision I made to become a vegetarian at 11, which was certainly not consistent with their diet at the time.</p><p>In New York I pretty much live in diners - I order French Fries, Diet Coke floats and lots of coffee.</p><p>I know what I have to do if I want to lose weight and stay healthy: eat a proper diet and exercise. All I&#39;ve got to do is apply it.</p><p>I&#39;m not strictly vegetarian, but meat doesn&#39;t play a big part in my diet.</p><p>Fruit is definitely on the maintenance diet.

So vitamins are valuable.</p><p>I freak out if I go a little too long without being in the gym. For a long time it was all about getting the weight off because I was 240 pounds at my heaviest, and now I&#39;m around 175, so the majority of that weight loss was due to diet and exercise.</p><p>I think I&#39;ve done every crazy diet there was in the beginning, but it&#39;s weird: I&#39;m thinner now than I was when I was modeling. I don&#39;t obsess about it.</p><p>I have to be very careful about diet and exercise.</p><p>Young girls look to me as a role model and think I crash diet to keep slim.

For breakfast, I try to get my first serving of fruits and nuts for fuel. I&#39;m completely addicted to coconut water for the electrolytes and hydration.</p><p>A bonus: You don&#39;t have to diet to direct.</p><p>I certainly feel that the time is not far distant when a knowledge of the principles of diet will be an essential part of one&#39;s education. Then mankind will eat to live, be able to do better mental and physical work and disease will be less frequent.</p><p>My diet is always terrible, unfortunately. I don&#39;t know moderation.</p><p>Everyone is going to binge on a diet, for instance, so plan for it, schedule it, and contain the damage.</p><p>When followed correctly, the Dukan Diet is both a safe and effective method of weight loss.</p><p>Mine is the least fat diet in the world.</p><p>Sex keeps me in shape. I don&#39;t diet, I eat what I like. I love Mars bars and I smoke and drink. But I love running off in the middle of the day to make love. It really burns up calories.</p><p>I think by planning an exercise regime, your diet follows to some extent.</p><p>She used to diet on any kind of food she could lay her hands on.</p><p>While pimples are not as simple as too much milk or sugar in your diet, both have a significant impact. Nutritional deficiencies as well as excesses can worsen acne.</p><p>Our typical Western diet is full of inflammatory fats - saturated fats, trans fats, too many omega-6, inflammatory, processed vegetable oils like soy and corn oils. These increase IGF-1 and stimulate pimple follicles.</p><p>I&#39;ve been more or less vegetarian for about 40 years. Health diet really helps. I do meditation every day, and either yoga or sport several times a week.</p><p>For the sake of argument and illustration I will presume that certain articles of ordinary diet, however beneficial in youth, are prejudicial in advanced life, like beans to a horse, whose common ordinary food is hay and corn.</p><p>For most of my 20s, I looked like I was 12. Now that I&#39;m pushing 40, I guess I look closer to... 15? It must be my macrobiotic diet. Oh, wait, except that I don&#39;t have one of those.</p><p>I don&#39;t diet, I don&#39;t do fads, I&#39;ve just decided to not eat carbs. So no more bread and pasta for the month. I can&#39;t live without chocolate, though. I&#39;ve always got a bar in my handbag. It has to be 72%. Any less and it&#39;s too sweet, any more and it&#39;s inedible. Like I said, I&#39;m very particular.</p><p>The best physicians are Dr. Diet, Dr. Quiet, and Dr. Merryman.</p><p>Uh, I just had an operation last March which was rather serious and I&#39;m recuperating now. I&#39;m on a very bland diet. But, uh, I&#39;m lucky, I was just lucky, that&#39;s all.</p><p>I have been following a vegan diet now since the 1980s, and find it not only healthier, but also much more attractive than the chunks of meat that were on my plate as a child.</p><p>A vegan diet takes care of most of what we need to do. But you&#39;ll also want to minimize the use of oils generally, because while olive oil and other vegetable oils are better for your heart than chicken fat, they are as fattening as animal fats.</p><p>I tried the paleo diet, which is the caveman diet - lots of meat. And I tried the calorie restriction diet: The idea is that if you eat very, very little - if you&#39;re on the verge of starvation, you will live a very long time, whether or not you want to, of course.</p><p>My goal? To test out every diet and exercise regimen on planet earth and figure out which work best. I sweated, I cooked, I learned to pole dance. In the end, I lost weight, lowered my cholesterol and doubled my energy level. I feel better than I ever have.</p><p>I&#39;m eating a lot of organic proteins and vegetables! Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is my No. 1 priority because I&#39;m nursing my daughter.</p><p>I almost fainted. There was no family history. I had been eating a vegetarian diet and I exercised.</p><p>The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail. Either they&#39;re outvoted by puppets of agribusiness, or they are puppets of agribusiness.</p><p>Let me pose you a question. Can farm-raised salmon be organic when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet, even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?</p><p>I am involved in Greenpeace. And I just recently completely switched my diet over to near-veganism. So you try to do little things that you can. I recycle every single day. Every single thing in my house that can be recycled is.</p><p>Eating at home is fine, as I can easily work around the foods that don&#39;t agree with me and still eat heartily with the rest of my family. I don&#39;t force them to follow my diet.</p><p>Love is such an objective thing. I mean, I can say I love my family, or I love my Diet Coke. So I guess, in different ways, yeah, I do believe in love.</p><p>The more I read and watched about the meat industry, the more determined I became to keep meat out of my diet. The things I saw in slaughterhouse exposes made me feel sick and I refused to just ignore what I now knew.</p><p>The vegan diet is obviously lacking whatever essential nutrient it is that makes people likeable.</p><p>If I could give one tip for people - it&#39;s not an exercise or nutrition regimen. It&#39;s to walk your talk and believe in yourself, because at the end of the day, the dumbbell and diet don&#39;t get you in shape. It&#39;s your accountability to your word.</p><p>If you think of exercise as a 60-minute commitment 3 times a week at the gym, you&#39;re missing the point completely. If you think that going on a diet has something to do with nutrition, you don&#39;t see the forest through the trees. It is a lifestyle. I know it sounds cliche, but you have to find things you love to do.</p><p>I dream about &#39;Cheers.&#39; Like when you go on a diet and you dream of pizza. I always think of those wonderful years. I loved working on it.</p><p>Hope is a very thin diet.</p><p>&#39;The 17 Day Diet&#39; keeps your body and metabolism guessing. I call this &#39;body confusion.&quot;</p><p>This cream will help one&#39;s nature strengthen and grow, The diet gives support in my decline.</p><p>My soul is dark with stormy riot: directly traced over to diet.</p><p>If cooking becomes an art form rather than a means of providing a reasonable diet, then something is clearly wrong.</p><p>The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.</p><p>All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.</p><p>All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.</p><p>Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.</p><p>Dream as if you&#39;ll live forever. Live as if you&#39;ll die today.</p><p>A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world.</p><p>A dream doesn&#39;t become reality through magic it takes sweat, determination and hard work.</p><p>Sleep is the best meditation.</p><p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.</p><p>I&#39;m sick of following my dreams. I&#39;m just going to ask them where they&#39;re goin&#39;, and hook up with them later.</p><p>My dream is of a place and a time where America will once again be seen as the last best hope of earth.</p><p>If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with success unexpected in common hours.</p><p>Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real.</p><p>There are those who look at things the way they are, and ask why... I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?</p><p>Yesterday is but today&#39;s memory, and tomorrow is today&#39;s dream.</p><p>We all have dreams. But in order to make dreams come into reality, it takes an awful lot of determination, dedication, self-discipline, and effort.</p><p>If you take responsibility for yourself you will develop a hunger to accomplish your dreams.</p><p>To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream not only plan, but also believe.</p><p>All human beings are also dream beings. Dreaming ties all mankind together.</p><p>Do all you can to make your dreams come true.</p><p>You have to dream before your dreams can come true.</p><p>Dreams have only one owner at a time. That&#39;s why dreamers are lonely.</p><p>Dreams are today&#39;s answers to tomorrow&#39;s questions.</p><p>Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men.</p><p>Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country.</p><p>Dreams are the touchstones of our character.</p><p>A man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams.</p><p>The most pitiful among men is he who turns his dreams into silver and gold.</p><p>Judge of your natural character by what you do in your dreams.</p><p>Dreams pass into the reality of action. From the actions stems the dream again and this interdependence produces the highest form of living.</p><p>Who looks outside, dreams who looks inside, awakes.</p><p>Dreams are necessary to life.</p><p>He was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative philosopher... or, as his wife would have it, an idiot.</p><p>Dream and give yourself permission to envision a You that you choose to be.</p><p>Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths.</p><p>I&#39;m a dreamer. I have to dream and reach for the stars, and if I miss a star then I grab a handful of clouds.</p><p>Youth is a wonderful thing. What a crime to waste it on children.</p><p>The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.</p><p>I close my eyes, then I drift away, into the magic night I softly say. A silent prayer, like dreamers do, then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you.</p><p>It takes a lot of courage to show your dreams to someone else.</p><p>The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.</p><p>Great dreams of great dreamers are always transcended.</p><p>Dream in a pragmatic way.</p><p>We all dream we do not understand our dreams, yet we act as if nothing strange goes on in our sleep minds, strange at least by comparison with the logical, purposeful doings of our minds when we are awake.</p><p>Each man should frame life so that at some future hour fact and his dreaming meet.</p><p>Dreams are true while they last, and do we not live in dreams?</p><p>In dreams begins responsibility.</p><p>I am accustomed to sleep and in my dreams to imagine the same things that lunatics imagine when awake.</p><p>Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.</p><p>So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.</p><p>Living in dreams of yesterday, we find ourselves still dreaming of impossible future conquests.</p><p>I&#39;ve always said that one night, I&#39;m going to find myself in some field somewhere, I&#39;m standing on grass, and it&#39;s raining, and I&#39;m with the person I love, and I know I&#39;m at the very point I&#39;ve been dreaming of getting to.</p><p>The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do.</p><p>No one should negotiate their dreams. Dreams must be free to fly high. No government, no legislature, has a right to limit your dreams. You should never agree to surrender your dreams.</p><p>Sometimes, the only realists are the dreamers.</p><p>Ideologies separate us. Dreams and anguish bring us together.</p><p>I think we dream so we don&#39;t have to be apart so long. If we&#39;re in each other&#39;s dreams, we can play together all night.</p><p>When you cease to dream you cease to live.</p><p>Only in our dreams are we free. The rest of the time we need wages.</p><p>All the things one has forgotten scream for help in dreams.</p><p>Dreaming or awake, we perceive only events that have meaning to us.</p><p>I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man.</p><p>A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.</p><p>All men of action are dreamers.</p><p>I stand for freedom of expression, doing what you believe in, and going after your dreams.</p><p>Like all dreamers, I mistook disenchantment for truth.</p><p>The dreamer can know no truth, not even about his dream, except by awaking out of it.</p><p>Those who have compared our life to a dream were right... we were sleeping wake, and waking sleep.</p><p>Dream manfully and nobly, and thy dreams shall be prophets.</p><p>I am a dreamer. Seriously, I&#39;m living on another planet.</p><p>God&#39;s gifts put man&#39;s best dreams to shame.</p><p>I have always been amazed at the way an ordinary observer lends so much more credence and attaches so much more importance to waking events than to those occurring in dreams... Man... is above all the plaything of his memory.</p><p>Perhaps life is just that... a dream and a fear.</p><p>I don&#39;t use drugs, my dreams are frightening enough.</p><p>I tell people I&#39;m too stupid to know what&#39;s impossible. I have ridiculously large dreams, and half the time they come true.</p><p>Dreaming of a tomorrow, which tomorrow, will be as distant then as &#39;tis today.</p><p>Dreams will get you nowhere, a good kick in the pants will take you a long way.</p><p>Dreaming men are haunted men.</p><p>My dreams were all my own I accounted for them to nobody they were my refuge when annoyed - my dearest pleasure when free.</p><p>Man is a genius when he is dreaming.</p><p>The world of men is dreaming, it has gone mad in its sleep, and a snake is strangling it, but it can&#39;t wake up.</p><p>We are near waking when we dream we are dreaming.</p><p>You have to have a dream so you can get up in the morning.</p><p>Was it only by dreaming or writing that I could find out what I thought?</p><p>I was always a dreamer, in childhood especially. People thought I was a little strange.</p><p>People are so busy dreaming the American Dream, fantasizing about what they could be or have a right to be, that they&#39;re all asleep at the switch. Consequently we are living in the Age of Human Error.</p><p>This is the city of dreamers and time and again it&#39;s the place where the greatest dream of all, the American dream, has been tested and has triumphed.</p><p>Only the dreamer shall understand realities, though in truth his dreaming must be not out of proportion to his waking.</p><p>One of the most adventurous things left us is to go to bed. For no one can lay a hand on our dreams.</p><p>We all keep dreaming, and luckily, dreams come true.</p><p>You know, Willie Wonka said it best: we are the makers of dreams, the dreamers of dreams.</p><p>Married or unmarried, young or old, poet or worker, you are still a dreamer, and will one time know, and feel, that your life is but a dream.</p><p>I challenge you to be dreamers I challenge you to be doers and let us make the greatest place in the world even better.</p><p>The interpretation of dreams is a great art.</p><p>Everybody&#39;s a dreamer.</p><p>People need dreams, there&#39;s as much nourishment in &#39;em as food.</p><p>That&#39;s what keeps me going: dreaming, inventing, then hoping and dreaming some more in order to keep dreaming.</p><p>You can plant a dream.</p><p>Writers write. Dreamers talk about it.</p><p>Oh, I was never a businessman. I was a visionary, a dreamer.</p><p>Take everything easy and quit dreaming and brooding and you will be well guarded from a thousand evils.</p><p>Strivers achieve what dreamers believe.</p><p>We should never discourage young people from dreaming dreams.</p><p>Only things the dreamers make live on. They are the eternal conquerors.</p><p>Go confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined.</p><p>I believe in everything until it&#39;s disproved. So I believe in fairies, the myths, dragons. It all exists, even if it&#39;s in your mind. Who&#39;s to say that dreams and nightmares aren&#39;t as real as the here and now?</p><p>Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams.</p><p>Follow your dreams, work hard, practice and persevere. Make sure you eat a variety of foods, get plenty of exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.</p><p>Cherish your visions and your dreams as they are the children of your soul, the blueprints of your ultimate achievements.</p><p>Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams who looks inside, awakes.</p><p>Friends... they cherish one another&#39;s hopes. They are kind to one another&#39;s dreams.</p><p>I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.</p><p>I prefer to be a dreamer among the humblest, with visions to be realized, than lord among those without dreams and desires.</p><p>But I, being poor, have only my dreams I have spread my dreams under your feet Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</p><p>The only thing that comes to a sleeping man is dreams.</p><p>I have learned, that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.</p><p>A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer, and shall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams.</p><p>Trust in dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.</p><p>Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do.</p><p>The only time you really live fully is from thirty to sixty. The young are slaves to dreams the old servants of regrets. Only the middle-aged have all their five senses in the keeping of their wits.</p><p>Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake.</p><p>If there are dreams about a beautiful South Africa, there are also roads that lead to their goal. Two of these roads could be named Goodness and Forgiveness.</p><p>The ninety and nine are with dreams, content but the hope of the world made new, is the hundredth man who is grimly bent on making those dreams come true.</p><p>The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.</p><p>If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.</p><p>I&#39;ll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours.</p><p>I am against nature. I don&#39;t dig nature at all. I think nature is very unnatural. I think the truly natural things are dreams, which nature can&#39;t touch with decay.</p><p>It is better to risk starving to death then surrender. If you give up on your dreams, what&#39;s left?</p><p>Dreams are often most profound when they seem the most crazy.</p><p>I really had a lot of dreams when I was a kid, and I think a great deal of that grew out of the fact that I had a chance to read a lot.</p><p>Keep true to the dreams of your youth.</p><p>Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.</p><p>Sometimes dreams are wiser than waking.</p><p>Why does the eye see a thing more clearly in dreams than the imagination when awake?</p><p>Believe in love. Believe in magic. Hell, believe in Santa Clause. Believe in others. Believe in yourself. Believe in your dreams. If you don&#39;t, who will?</p><p>Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</p><p>We cast away priceless time in dreams, born of imagination, fed upon illusion, and put to death by reality.</p><p>Man, alone, has the power to transform his thoughts into physical reality man, alone, can dream and make his dreams come true.</p><p>Our life is composed greatly from dreams, from the unconscious, and they must be brought into connection with action. They must be woven together.</p><p>Dreams must be heeded and accepted. For a great many of them come true.</p><p>Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It is about dreams. Usually, it doesn&#39;t work out exactly as you might have imagined. Steve Jobs was fired at Apple. He came back and changed the world.</p><p>Just what future the Designer of the universe has provided for the souls of men I do not know, I cannot prove. But I find that the whole order of Nature confirms my confidence that, if it is not like our noblest hopes and dreams, it will transcend them.</p><p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s been my biggest problem all my life... it&#39;s money. It takes a lot of money to make these dreams come true.</p><p>Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.</p><p>Don&#39;t give up on your dreams, or your dreams will give up on you.</p><p>If you dream the proper dreams, and share the myths with people, they will want to grow up to be like you.</p><p>Computers are magnificent tools for the realization of our dreams, but no machine can replace the human spark of spirit, compassion, love, and understanding.</p><p>Both dreams and myths are important communications from ourselves to ourselves. If we do not understand the language in which they are written, we miss a great deal of what we know and tell ourselves in those hours when we are not busy manipulating the outside world.</p>",2500)]))}const y=t(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
