legal interpretation professor campos is not admitted to the bar in the state of colorado illinois or michiganoutside the legal community campos is perhaps best known for his 2004 book the obesity myth later published as the diet myth which reviews medical research on the association between higher body mass and health camposs contentions that obesity is healthy were praised by some sociologists and critical theorists and overwhelmingly criticized by medical epidemiological and statistical researchers with professional training in empirical researchsoowon kim and barry m popkin praised campos for bringing attention to some of the complexities in overweightobesity and health relationships and covert financial interests involved in obesity research but criticized him for selective use of research fallacious interpretation of literature and misunderstanding of basic epidemiological principles and thereby harming the most vulnerable subgroups in the population neville rigby criticized camposs lack of relevant academic qualifications and poor grasp of scientific research noting that it is unusual to find academics concerned chiefly with legal social political and educational issues seeking to challenge the whole arena of the epidemiology clinical and public health aspects of the obesity problem to start from scratch to deal with all their spurious statements in this response is hardly appropriate the suggestion that there is growing concern about the validity of the serious health issues associated with obesity is really quite bizarre as there has been the most remarkable and growing consensus among an extensive range of governments academics health economists and policy makers relating to the impact of excess weight gain june stevens jill e mcclain and kimberly p truesdale countered specific claims about the state of scientific research made by campos camposs obesity work was praised by sociologist susie orbach for discussing unhealthy body image issues related to an emphasis on extreme thinnessother obesity skeptics have cited camposs work as support for their own views for example in his 2010 book the end of the obesity epidemic michael gard an honorary associate professor at the university of queenslands school of human movement studies identified campos as one of three scholars along with university of chicago political scientist eric oliver and arizona state university exercise physiologist glenn gaesser who have led the way in constructing a counternarrative to the claims of those who argue higher body weight represents a major public health crisis together these three authors have helped popularize obesity skepticism as a legitimate intellectual position most crucial of all they have each contributed to building the case against seeing obesity per se as a disease demonstrating that the health risks of fatness are at the very least highly debatable more recently campos has been a tireless acerbic and superbly articulate warrior in his extensive print and electronic media worktwo years later in 2012 gard criticized campos for overstating the empirical case for obesity skepticism and for relying too much on criticisms of the motives of certain obesity researchers in 2012 gard wrote paul campos constantly uses words like myth truth lies and liars when writing about mainstream obesity science obesity scientists are not liars involved in a con and they are not by and large hysterical how easy it is to dismiss those with whom we disagree by calling them bad and mad in 2012 gard also concluded that campos and other obesity skeptics have had little if any impact on mainstream scientific and popular obesity crisis discourse as of the fall of 2014 camposs publications regarding obesityrelated controversies had been cited according to google scholar more than 700 times by other writers on the subject citation needed or should be removedcamposs writing appears on the blog

scholars including brian leiter of the university of chicago law school according to leiter camposs blog contained misleading inaccurate and inflammatory statements leiter also criticized campos more broadly for allegedly shirking his job responsibilities through poor scholarship and poor teaching campos in turn has responded by accusing leiter of allegedly using sock puppets to anonymously praise

ruth merseburger who was a part of the james wharram design team until she died on 4 september 2013 sailed tangaroa across the atlantic to trinidad no scholars in the western world at this time believed that the polynesians had boats capable of directed ocean voyages james believed otherwise and set out to prove it by doing it himself he followed this first atlantic crossing by building a 40 veed hull double canoe rongo in trinidad in 19578 with bernard moitessiers help and sailing her across the north atlantic in 1959 from new york to ireland this was the first westtoeast crossing of the atlantic by catamaranmultihullsince these first pioneering voyages james from 1973 assisted by his codesigner hanneke boon has been designing polynesian style catamarans for people to build themselves to bring the concept of seaworthy oceangoing double canoes to the western yachting public meeting a lot of resistance from the british yachting establishment on the way particularly in the early years when people still could not accept that a native boat could be as good or better a sailing ship than a western type yacht particularly when such a craft was selfbuilt by an amateur after more than 50 years they are now an accepted feature in the world of yachtingocean sailing and can be seen in most harbours of the worldin 198792 james and his partners built a new flagship the 63foot catamaran

double canoes based on traditional polynesian hullform from the philippines to tikopia and anuta in the solomon islands the lapita voyage was a major expedition in experimental marine archaeology it was the first exploration of one possible migration route into the central pacific by ethnic sailing craft this voyage was comparable to thor heyerdahls voyage of the kontiki with which he attempted to prove the polynesians migrated into the pacific from south america since proven incorrect the two boats were donated to the remote polynesian islands for future transport use james and hanneke are at present involved with designing sailing double canoes for use in remote pacific islands to help with the increasing transport problemsjames wharram is considered the father of multihulls in many

altarpiecesin 1974 a work by goller was sold to the cleveland museum of art for 1 million it was purchased by the museum as a painting of st catherine by matthias grnewald the painting was on a panel that contained a crack woodworm holes and evidence of repairs all of which it appears had been added to give the painting an antique appearance after an art historian questioned the paintings authenticity the museum engaged conservator hubert von sonnenburg to examine it his analysis of pigments from the painting showed the presence of processed chalk and the absence of silver traces in the lead paint both indicating that the materials used were modern because the painting had passed through the hands of several intermediaries before being sold to the museum goller was not prosecuted he claimed that he had sold the painting under his own name and that the attribution had been the work of one of the intermediate ownersmichael hofbauer a german art historian who specialises in the works of cranach the elder has alleged that goller has produced up to 55 fake cranachs hofbauer says that a portrait of the emperor charles v described and attributed by christies amsterdam saleroom

has stated that he knows of more than 60 paintings presently attributed to various artists including cranach which he attributes to goller he also says that the paintings he ascribes to goller have certain common features they are painted on soft gauze or similar on a base of gesso which is then affixed to a wooden panel he adds that the palette is limited to a few dull colours and that an analysis of the chemical composition of the pigments in these paintings such as white lead shows that the pigments used in the paintings are typical of those that would have been used in the 16th century however the hands of the figures are not characteristic of cranach and the craquelure evident in the paintings is not the result of aging but has been artificially produced in addition hofbauer says he possesses correspondence from dieter koepplin de of basel an expert in the paintings of the cranachs in which he claimed that goller had produced forgeries koepplin added that he did not know the specific paintingsthe district court of passau and the badenwrttemberg state office of criminal investigation have begun an investigation into gollers activities"},{"author":"Jenna

absorbing everything around us and accepting much of it as true especially when it comes from our parents the confusion and blind belief of this period can also lead to the early formation of trauma and other deep problems the critical thing here is to learn a sense of right and wrong good and bad this is a human construction which we nevertheless often assume would exist even if we were not here which is an indication of how deeply imprinted it has become2 the modeling period between the ages of eight and thirteen we copy people often our parents but also other people rather than blind acceptance we are trying on things like suit of clothes to see how they feel we may be much impressed with religion or our teachers you may remember being particularly influenced by junior school teachers who seemed so knowledgeablemaybe even more so than your parents3 the socialization period between 13 and 21 we are very largely influenced by our peers as we develop as individuals and look for ways to get away from the earlier programming we naturally turn to people who seem more like us other influences at these ages include the media especially those parts which seem to resonate with
