specific groups of people such as trainspotters and morris dancers to which he added a voiceover describing an imagined connection or intimacy with the subjectsdelusion is key to ben judds work that an experience could be evidently constructed but somehow the observer and in turn the viewer of the work buys into the experience the groups of people that he videos tourists trainspotters amateur photographers morris dancers preachers witches are part of a group and also detached from a larger group similarly his activity mirrors theirs he is also on the periphery of their group and is both a voyeur and participant judds position is simultaneously close and distant or connected and disconnectedjudds photographs display a similar interest in the relationship between the constructed and the natural his 3d photographs encapsulate a dichotomy the viewer is simultaneously aware of their construction yet is also deluded that the experience is realwhile on residency in colombia in 2007 judd formed his own group by fabricating the contradictory movement i will heal you which took its beliefs from an eclectic range of sources this work culminated in a performance in which he adopted the role of the movements leader the accompanying video see i will heal you was constructed through his contact with a witch a parapsychologist a scientologist and the sole member of a new religion during which he attempted to believe even on a temporary basis in what he was being told or was being asked to do key phrases from judds interactions with these people were used as lyrics for songs which were included in the video altering the viewers interpretation of the words from ordinary to prophetic or vice versa in may 2007 judd was interviewed by miser now 1 magazine on the work he produced therein previous work my intervention has largely been enacted through a series of voiceovers that provoke an almost imagined level of intervention in terms of what is being seen with this work i wanted to put myself directly into the work and to join these belief systems i wanted to add dimension and i really enjoyed it i think that i built up the idea of the movement so much and had so many collaborators on board that a performative outcome became inevitable there was an amazing sense of build up prior to the opening night more and more things were being made the space was being transformed and at that stage i knew that if i wanted this thing to be believable then the ultimate conclusion was wearing the outfits and becoming the work the project culminated in inviting people to visit the movement this became an effective way to express the contradiction and dual function that i wanted within the work people were invited to join the movement but also warned that it was a sham and that they should stay away the manifesto for the movement was contradictory throughout it was read in english and spanish so everything fed into this idea of a duality it created a rhythm that in some way echoed the techniques of repetition adopted by many of the individuals and groups that i had been involved with in may 2008 judd invited two mediums to explore a gallery space with members of the public which resulted in a sance and a demonstration of clairvoyance see the video presence at httpwwwbenjuddcom judd has also videod himself at a class for clairvoyants in which he stood up in front of the class and demonstrated his clairvoyant abilities see the video close to you as with previous work judd is interested in challenging his preconceptions about a particular belief system as an atheist and a skeptic he attempts to buy into an ideology and adopt the role of a believer judd genuinely participates in the activity yet is also aware of his position as an observer and of how the act of videoing will recontextualise what is experienced"},{"author":"Mark G.

valuethe title what has befallen us barbad is taken from a short story by this name written by houshang golshiri in the story barbad is a fiveyear old boy who has witnessed what has been done to his father in the prison of islamic republic of iran barbad stops talking and never describes what he has witnessed instead of talking he draws childish but horrifying paintings my name and my life are taken from this character the short story itself has a hypotext in sassanid period khosrow parviz the persian king had a magnificent horse called shabdiz parviz loved his horse frantically and had said that he will kill any one who brings the news of shabdizs death shabdiz dies and no one dares to bring the news to the king barbad the courtier musician comes and plays so sadly that makes the king ask has shabdiz died in my work barbad who is the artist is mourning what has befallen him and us in a traditional manner on the other hand what has befallen us barbad is about art praxis is on my faustian experience selling not just my soul but also my body that is why i chose body art and i chose myself as the subject of the praxis this piece is about exhausting myself with art but not for any rewards or exalted goals it is just because of my addiction because of the cancer of time a poor habit for nothing if you preferin apex art conference abbas milani the iranian writer who lives in exile gave a lecture on the video showing no interest in the stereotyped issues milani saidin mideighties houshang golshiri wrote a short story of stunning power it has much in common with his later masterpiece king of the benighteda book i translated into english in what has befallen us barbad the narrator a woman talks of her son named barbad a child who has seen the inferno of an islamic republic prison and the experience has rendered him mute he only observes and paints the horror horror of what he has seen can not be rendered in words only images can help assuage his anger and painnot long after his fathers death his son the barbad of the story and the eternal barbad of iranian history has given us another rendition of his sad tale barbad is the troubled muse of iranian music he is our tormented dionysus he was a master of mirth and melancholy to khosrowparviz the ultimate king of preislamic iran he sang of sorrows and victories when the kings favorite horse shabdiz died no one dared tell him of his loss he had threatened to kill any bearer of such message barbad cleverly conveyed the bad news through a masterful composition and when the king was imprisoned by his sonincidentally a rarity in iranian history where it is always the fathers that kill their sonsthe grieved barbad burned his musical instruments and cut off his own playing fingers lest he be tempted to make music againour barbad takes a different path he surely gives of himself but not to kill his art but to create it this time it is the patriarchs who are killing their children and imprisoning their souls and the sons defiant and selfassured angry but not despondent ask again what has befallen us barbadthe video begins with an empty white space a tabula rasa a canvas defiantly and briskly a head of hair as much of bob marley as of barbad as likely of a woman as a man appears there is no face but only the menace of a scissor and a pair of hands clad in white hair we know is a much contested part of human anatomy in islamic societies in man and even more so in woman it is a potential tool of the devil in woman the first now eminently liberal president of the islamic republic told us it is charged with erotic electricity it can ensnare the hapless men around it in man too it can be a sign of frivolity morality police roam the cities searching for men with long hairs and for women with any evident hair and barbad reversing the samson myth where hair was a sign and guarantor of his power has turned the hair into the ultimate metaphor for all that has happened to art and humanity in iran but this is no mere lament against oppression it is also a call to action an act of creation not just of his soul but even of his body the androgynous figure of these powerful images is willing to give there is in the gestures of the hand and the head defiance anger and sacrifice in kubricks memorable beginning of full metal jacket young marines are being shorn of their hair and of their identity so that the foulmouthed sergeant can make of them a killing machine here however the sheering is voluntary and from it comes the redemption of art the scissor at times comes close to cutting not just the hair but the handmaking art in iran can be a dangerous proposition guerrillas even if soft are the enemies of state there is also moments of apparent resignation where the head seems to want to escape the ordeal but a force mysterious but powerful keeps it in its placeand by the end of the process as the hand at times angrily other times with decided deliberation throws away the hair the once empty canvas has become an eerily and powerfully resonant image full of charactersthere stands a hint of a cloud and here the apparition of simorgh the wise bird of iranian mythology it is painting by hairdrip it is to borrow nietzsches words creating art by blood read in the context of iran it is a cry against oppression censorship and brutality read in a global semiotics it is a defiant manifesto for the necessity of creating art of communicating with the world at any price barbad is at once persian and globalbarbad golshiris critical approach along with presenting the obscene in his works has compelled the artist to exhibit most of his works outside iran this could be one of the reasons why he has been participating mostly in international

appointement as secretary of education in the administration of president george h w bush allaire transformed the office of the president into a newly formed corporate office with four executives dividing the responsibilities that usually fall under the president and chief operating officer the group shared operational responsibilities for xeroxs nine worldwide business units and three worldwide geographic customer operations units one of these four key officials was a barry rand executive vice president of operations and one of the highestranking africanamericans in business at the timewhen allaire became ceo xerox had billions of dollars in insurance liabilities so he methodically disentangled the company from property and casualty insurance and other financialservices businesses allaire also rolled out costcutting and new product technology introductions including the first digital copierdocument center in 1994 allaire rebranded xerox as the document company to signal its ambition to move far beyond copiers as the growth of desktop computing stimulated huge increases in the number of documents being created under allaires leadership through quality program xerox was the first us company to won back lost market share from the japanesein 1997 allaire hired g richard rick thoman from ibm as xerox president and coo which positioned thoman as the eventual

allaire was succeeded as ceo by thoman but remained chairman of the board allaire had intended to retire but the board convinced him to stay on since thoman was an outsider as a nod to cfo barry d romeril and william f buehler who were allaire loyalists that were ending up passed over in the succession planning allaire requested that they be given seats on the board as vicechairmanallaire and thoman both shared the vision that xerox needed to reinvent itself to succeed in the digital age and thomans record of working with gerstner in ibms turnaround made him the ideal person to lead the transformation however it has been reported that many of xeroxs senior executives including romeril and buehler remained loyal to allaire and viewed thoman as an outsider these undercut thomans authority as ceo as he was only able to make a few senior management changes and the entrenched bureaucracy as xerox nicknamed burox provided passive resistance to thomans initiatives this in turn may have contributed to several botched reorganizations under his tenureafter thoman was fired in 2000 allaire was once again appointed ceo and he promoted anne m mulcahy to president and coo allaire

musicians that included alice and nikolaus harnoncourt and the harpsichordist gustav leonhardt who started the early music movementhe performed and recorded more than 200 works from the mid 17th through the late 18th centuries with his ensemble capella academica wien or the french harpsichordist huguette dreyfus and in his time tapped a worldwide audiencefrom 1958 melkus was a professor of violin baroque violin viola and historical performance practice at the vienna academy of music in 1982 he became head of the institute for viennese sound styleas a violin soloist eduard melkus is a precursor to the current wave in the revival of historically informed baroque period performance his bestknown recordings include deutsche grammophon lps of the corelli violin sonatas opus 5 with rare extant 18thcentury embellishments prepared in conjunction with musicologist marc pincherle the biber rosary sonatasfor which he won the deutscher schallplattenpreis in 1967 tartininardini violin

recordings melkus played an unaltered violin by aegidius kloz made in mittenwald ca 1760 while the rest of his ensemble the cappella academica wien played on far more expensive italian instruments borrowed from the vienna akademie fur musik and restored to resemble their original conditions melkus later recordings of such works as bachs sonatas for violin and harpsichord were made on a retrofitted violin by nicolo amati of cremona in 1679 though a richersounding and historically more important instrument melkus always sounded more daring and comfortable on the kloz moreover as melkus always pointed out in liner notes the kloz is rare in that it survived with its original neck bassbar and fingerboard rather than requiring somewhat speculative retrofittingwhich cannot be said for the amati and no amatis survive in original state for restorer consultation melkus owns three other instruments by nicolo amati comprising a complete string quartet by that unequalled makermelkus is not much remembered today 2008 because his style included many anachronistic elements the use of modern wire and wirecovered strings rather than gut ubiquitous modern a1440 pitch a chinrest not even invented until the 1820s and continuous rather distracting vibrato in these ways he departed from those betterknown colleagues in vienna with whom he began the harnoncourts oddly he never adapted to methods that have been shown by scholars as more appropriate historically even more recently his older recordings are generally dismissed and have not been reissued on cd it is a pity because despite his less authentic sound the recordings of the 19651971 period reveal in his playing what is lacking in most players today an instantly recognizable personal sound and style and most significantly an enthusiasm for embellishing music in ways that more contemporary period players seldom attempt but their 18thcentury forbears did without question in that sense he is more historical

extended to gunnysacks textiles and insurance in the second generation in 1979 the group consisted of nineteen firms still based mainly in agriculturerelated sectors the patriarch of this second generation pornchai leophairatana sent his sons to the usa to study accounting economics and engineering returning to thailand in the era when the economy was shifting decisively towards industry using newly found supplies of natural gas prachai leophairatana and his five siblings launched the firm into cement and petrochemicals in the 1990s prachai expanded tpi with massive offshore loans to take advantage of the then vast interest rate gap between the thai baht and us dollar unfortunately most of the loans were not hedged because as prachai put it the thai government had pledged the baht peg would be defended the peg was around 25 baht to the us dollar by the mid1990s the number of firms had expanded to fortyfour total revenues had multiplied twentyfive times tpl had risen rapidly to second rank in the cement market behind the venerable siam cement it had also become a major player in the booming petrochemicals industry by 1994 it had become southeast asias first fully integrated

worldthe baht however proved vulnerable under significant speculative attacks its defences crumbled the thai currency was floated on july 2 1997 by january 1998 the baht exchange rate had shot up to 56 to the us dollar with tpis total loans reaching us38 billion its creditors led by bangkok bank decided to get tough in early 2000 thailands bankruptcy court approved the creditors debt restructuring plan and appointed australiabased effective planners as the plan administrator the plan called for a debttoequity swap of us756 million and the sale of noncore assets to raise us200 millionmany thought that would spell the end of prachai who had effectively turned one of the regions largest petrochemical complexes into thailands biggest corporate debtor but it didnt prachai refused to budge he stayed on as tpis chief executive and for a while even reported for work every morning he also besieged the court by filing more than 35 different legal challenges against the plan and effective planners the latter had to spend millions of dollars to fend off litigation although most of the lawsuits were dismissed prachai has always maintained he was not fighting for himself but for tpi and its workers many observers though feel the workout plan which slashed the leophairatana familys stake in the company to 15 from 60 left the 58year old entrepreneur feeling embitteredprachais persistence however seems to have paid off on april 21 2003 he scored an important victory in the bankruptcy court on that fateful day to the shock of the thai and foreign legal communities the court ordered the removal of effective planners as tpis plan administrator and appointed prachai as a temporary replacement instead in response the creditors suspended us80 million in working capital facilities vital to tpi just a few days prior to the april 21 judgment the creditors had declared support for effective planners even though as prachai pointed out later it had failed to meet most of the targets outlined in the debt rehabilitation planeffective planners was expected to incur expenses not exceeding 640 million baht in the 200102 fiscal year april 1 2001 to march 31 2002 but as prachai told the court the sum was closer to 157 billion baht also under the plan the companys oil refining capacity was targeted to hit 125000 barrels per day by the end of the fiscal year but by the start of april 2002 the tpi refinery was only churning out 82000 barrels per day the court rejected effective planners defence that the operating environment for tpi had worsened considerably following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the us instead in a highly unusual move it recommended that the debtor side be adequately represented on a new steering committeethe thai government stepped in by saying it would help mediate in the matter and proposed the appointment of a chairperson acceptable to both sides to lead the new steering committee consisting of seven representatives each from the creditors and the debtor side the thai bankruptcy law is very clear on the control of reorganization creditors have final say the debtor has to be cooperative and really has a minimal role to play says kowit somwaiya partner at herbert smith in thailand but kowit says it was within the discretion of the court to recommend a joint panel consisting of representatives of both sides someone is needed who can bring both sides half way someone khun prachai can trustcreditors had conceded to allow one prachai representative and one government representative to sit on the new steering panel which would otherwise consist only of the members of thai administrators ltd talthe june 13 judgment appointing the finance ministry as tpis debt administrator is seen as limiting creditors future course of action tal was seen as the best hope for creditors as it consists of formidable members of thailands business and legal communityproposed by creditors as the debt plan administrator tal was rejected outright by prachai and in its june 13 ruling the court said tals plan appeared to be inadequate for creating the cash flow needed to service tpis huge debt the company is obliged to make interest payments of around us85 million every monththe court it seems has transferred the burden of responsibility onto the shoulders of the state we had proposed to mediate in setting up a joint panel which would appoint financial advisors to conduct due diligence so that a new debt restructuring plan could be proposed said kitti limsakul an advisor to thailands finance minister before the june 13 ruling but we respect the right of the creditors kitti said the government would not act unless directed by the courtin what would be a clear sign of things to come the court had already signalled its approval of a government role in the crisis judge kamol teeravetponkul of the central bankruptcy court on may 21 2003 said that the businesses run by tpi were too big to be nursed back to health by the private sector the appointment of a tripartite debt administration team as suggested by the government is good solution reuters news agency quoted kamol as saying two weeks earlier prime minister thaksin shinawatra himself proposed that a third party be appointed to mediate in the matter it was kamol who delivered the june 13 rulingby and large financial experts have given a thumbs down to what they see as intervention by the state it seems the prime minister is getting involved in a micro level this is a step backward said a hong kong based credit analyst at a european bank the analyst like his many of colleagues in the industry based outside bangkok see the resolution of the tpi case as a litmus test for the restructuring of billions of dollars worth of thai corporate debt and crucial to thailands ability to attract and retain foreign investmentobservers based in the thai capital however are more tempered the tpi case is very unique kowit explains first the amount involved us38 billion is huge second the companys labour union who have mostly supported prachai is very strong and lastly the creditor side involves some of the largest domestic and foreign institutions kowit also says many in thailand were surprised that the rehabilitation plan did not permit any haircuts and that the creditors could take 75 equity in the company through conversion of accrued interest of us756 million in only three yearsprachai has repeatedly accused the lenders of not paying enough attention to the longterm viability of the company and focusing primarily on maximizing shortterm returnsspeaking after the june 13 judgment kitti limsakul the advisor to thailands finance minister told dow jones newswires that an earlier proposal to set up for a 15member tripartite debt administration team consisting of seven members each from the creditor and debtor side headed by a mediator from the government had been modified now the finance ministry is willing to permit unequal representation of the two sides depending on who is suitable with the 2005 ruling prachai was forced to sell his and his familys stock at 70 below the market price at 330 baht per share to the recently privatized petroleum corporation ptt subsequently prachai and his siblings were ejected from the board and was replaced by the board assigned by ptt public company limited of whom were close allies of thaksin shinawatra prachai leophairatana and his family were able to retain a small portion of their wealth and now are the board members of the tpi polene

are deeply indebted to him for his years of effort to bring help and healing to those who have suffered sexual abuse and for what he has done to establish protocols of professional standards for church personnel in this area the books questioning of the authority of the church is connected to bishop robinsons uncertainty about the knowledge and authority of christ himself catholics believe that the church founded by christ is endowed by him with a teaching office which endures through time this is why the churchs magisterium teaches the truth authoritatively in the name of christ the book casts doubt upon these teachingsthis leads in turn to the questioning of catholic teaching on among other things the nature of tradition the inspiration of the holy scripture the infallibility of the councils and the pope the authority of the creeds the nature of the ministerial priesthood and central elements of the churchs moral teaching robinson replied to the bishops in his reflections on

worldwide petition drive calling for an ecumenical council inclusive of the laity to put gods house in order the petition addressed to pope francis sayswe the undersigned members of the catholic church have been sickened by the continuing stories of sexual abuse within our church and we are appalled by the accounts of an unchristian response to those who have suffered when so many people either offend or respond poorly we cannot limit ourselves to blaming individuals but must also look at systemic causes the situation is so grave that we call for an ecumenical council to respond to the one question of doing everything possible to uproot such abuse from the church and produce a better response to victims an essential part of this call is that the laity of the whole world should have a major voice in the council for it is our children who have been abused or put at risk and that the following subjects be included the continuing influence of the idea of an angry god the immaturity that arises from passive obedience in adults the teaching of the church on sexual morality the part played in abuse by celibacy especially obligatory celibacy the lack of a strong feminine influence in every aspect of the church the idea that through ordination the priest is taken above other people clericalism the lack of professionalism in the life of priest s and religious the unhealthy situations in which many priests and religious are required to live the constant placing of right beliefs before right actions the passion for secrecy and the hiding of faults within the

his race boat engine builder instructed him not to rev the engines beyond 5800 rpm to cazzani this made no sense jimmy dissected the engines and decided to change their internal geometry which would change their operational characteristics the engines internals were replaced with light strong components the change in operating range would require larger camshafts better flowing cylinder heads
