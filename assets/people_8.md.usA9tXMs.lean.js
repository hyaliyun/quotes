earlier works such as arrivals 1987 and time and fire 1991 however with the composition of scherzo 1992 a parallel concern with the anecdotal and pictorial possibilities of recognisable sounds began to emerge and much of his subsequent work plays on the tensions between these two approaches since moving to wales much of the evocation of image in his music relates to the landscape of the area in

a class b player what opening to play and then followed his advice zuckerman became known as zook the book or zuckerbook because he knew more about opening theory than could be found in any bookzuckerman is 22 days younger than bobby fischer and sometimes jested that when he got as old as fischer he would be just as strong zuckerman was one of fischers few close friends and taught him much about the sicilian defence and other openings fischer used zuckermans advice successfully see the 1962 game bilekfischer for exampleby 1964 zuckerman was strong enough to play in the us chess

and political science at the university of edinburgh her research fields include intersectional security international relations theory and gender politics in 2008 dr duncanson and dr eschle published a coauthored article titled gender and the nuclear weapons state a feminist critique of the uk governments white paper on trident the primary inquiry in her work was to establish a connection between gender and the nuclear weapons state while giving credit to carol cohn she tackles the issue of gendered language and its place within feminist critique of the white paper her argument is that since the military is so highly masculinized there is room for feminist critique and opposition because the evidence is not only apparent but is also overwhelming in that gender narratives are predominantly generalized with positive and negative sexualized connotations her claim is that not only is mitigation of gender narratives required within the military but that they are a necessity to disassembling the addiction and need for nuclear weaponsby examining the white paper from a feminist point of view she is able to establish that the way in which the state contextualized the language used within the white paper publication is predominantly under the standard of sexual potency and masculinity however the feminine terminology is stigmatized within military language thus creating a duality of sexual binaries where one is inherently better than the other by simple term association within the language narrative the sexual metaphorical imagery of vertical erector launchers thrusttoweight ratios soft lay downs deep perpetration and orgasmic whump gives evidence to the predominant phallic nature of the military furthermore there is an underlying discourse towards gendered weakness by the dichotomy of the protector and the protected she asserts that classifying something as invulnerable invincible and impregnable is a masculine trait because by definition and association of pregnancies women are the ones susceptible to pregnancy following this logic one can assume that the role of protector falls into the role of the empowered male and the protected is therefore the vulnerable females in a further example of the binary she assumes the role of the protector as the state itself and that any rational individual within can depict their ideologies as a sober and mature man who gives careful thought to the achievement of his purposes she indicated that this once again creates the illusion that the realist state is a rational manly state thus creating the multitude of different dichotomies such as activepassive independent interdependent rationalirrational each signifying the proposed association of the positive traits to the male gender and the negative to the female gender she concludes that while there is less than expected of masculine lined language it is apparent that at both face value and while reading between the lines that feminine terminology is devalued throughout the white paper"},{"author":"Tracy Yardley","quote":"tracy yardley often spelled tracy yardley born july 19 1979 is an american comic book artist best known for his

his site has also been translated in many languages for his efforts and vision he was recognized by the adobe design achievement awards he currently lives in omaha nebraskasimilar to the works of pop

unlike pop art he used barcodes as a tool and image such as his portraits which were made entirely from bar codes blake had started this project around the time of the y2k bug and the turn of the 21st century around this time there was a craze with barcode style artworks and designs it is unclear whether blake had direct input on this popularized phenomenain 2003 blake created downloading pixels which shows a progression of downloaded pixels that in turn become an image that could be viewed on a monitor or mobile device like john f simon jrs every icon each pixel is an image that loads up at different intervals to make the image seem like an animation caused by the changing pixels both every icon and downloading pixels use a system of algorithms with basic image data to form images visitors to the website can adjust the size of the overall image by selecting from many image sizes such as 48x48 192x192 300x300 or a very large 972x972 there are also options for different styles

group of wiccans living in englands west country during the 1940s these claims were first publicised in 1993 when the english company capall bann published ryalls west country wicca a journal of the old religion in which she made the claims that when growing up along the borders between the english counties of devon and somerset she was initiated into a local wiccan tradition that many of the people in the surrounding villages were members of claiming that they were pregardnerian she asserted that her family had not been wiccan and as such she was not a hereditary witch but that aged sixteen she like many other boys and girls who were the same age were taken to the female elders of the village who taught them about the craftryall continued her claim asserting that the religions local followers worshiped the great goddess who was often known as the green lady and who it was believed slept during the winter months along with a horned god whom they referred to as old horny ryall claimed that the wiccans met in secretive covens and performed the drawing down the moon rite as a part of their faith as well as celebrating five sabbats annually which were termed lady day 25 march beltane 30 april the summer solstice 21 june samhain 31 october and the winter solstice 21 december describing the groups practices she claimed that they wore robes which were mainly brown or black although for festivals they were usually green and that they used a cup a knife a wand and a dish of salt as their ritual tools she also claimed that they wrote nothing down and as such did not make use of a book of shadowsnonetheless historians and researchers studying the history of wicca have been very sceptical of ryalls claims professor ronald hutton stated that if ryalls claims had concerned just a coven or two then they might have been more plausible but to portray a widespread and deeply entrenched folk religion stretches credulity to breaking point the possibility must therefore be accepted that while in australia she has devised her own variety of wicca which she has tried here to pass off as an old traditionin later years ryall went on to write and publish a number of other books on wicca and magic through capall bann including celtic lore and druid ritual 1994 weaving the web of magic a potpourri of rituals chants dances webs cords runes talismans and

over windsor ontario the pilots lost much of their control but were able to land the aircraft safely using differential throttling to control glide angle in the ensuing investigation it was learned that the door had improperly latched due to a minor electrical problem and a locking mechanism that was supposed to ensure that the latches were in place could be forced closed even if they were notthe applegate memorandum was written shortly after the flight 96 incident on 27 june and delivered to applegates immediate supervisor jb hurt applegate voiced his concerns to management about potential design faults in the door in his view these faults could cause the aircrafts cargo doors to open midflight should this occur there would be an instantaneous loss of pressurization of the cargo area it followed that the pressurised passenger cabin floor which lay just above would buckle under the pressure differential applegate noted that this precise failure had occurred during ground testing in 1970 he believed that if this were to happen in flight the planes essential control lines which ran through the floor would be cut and the pilots would lose control of the aircraft a potentially fatal crash would seem imminentthe report included the followingthe fundamental safety of the cargo door latching system has been progressively degraded since the program began in 1968 the airplane demonstrated an inherent susceptibility to catastrophic failure when exposed to explosive decompression of the cargo compartment in 1970 ground testssince murphys law being what it is cargo

the whistle and in 1974 turkish airlines flight 981 crashed on the outskirts of paris killing all 346 people on board it was later ascertained that the crash was due to the same technical fault
