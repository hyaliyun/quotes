	Where the spirit does not work with the hand there is no art.
	
	Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle.
	The statesman who would attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would not only load himeslf with a most unnecessary attention but assume an authority which could safetly be trusted to no council and senate whatever and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.
	Some people use language to express thought some to conceal thought and others instead of thought.

	More than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads. One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction. Let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly.
	The most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people.
	If a nation could not prosper without the enjoyment of perfect liberty and perfect justice there is not in the world a nation which could ever have prospered.

	Neither man or nation can exist without a sublime idea.
	What some call health if purchased by perpetual anxiety about diet isn&#39;t much better than tedious disease.
	Well the telling of jokes is an art of its own and it always rises from some emotional threat. The best jokes are dangerous and dangerous because they are in some way truthful.
	Reality is merely an illusion albeit a very persistent one.
	Those are my principles. If you don&#39;t like them I have others.
	Perfect humility dispenses with modesty.
	Strength of mind is exercise not rest.

	In wartime truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.
	All men are not homeless but some men are home less than others.
	The price of greatness is responsibility.
	I think that everyone should get married at least once so you can see what a silly outdated institution it is.
	An event has happened upon which it is difficult to speak and impossible to be silent.
	The reason I love my dog so much is because when I come home he&#39;s the only one in the world who treats me like I&#39;m The Beatles.
	Round numbers are always false.
	Mankind censure injustice fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink from committing it.
	If you surveyed a hundred typical middle-aged Americans I bet you&#39;d find that only two of them could tell you their blood types but every last one of them would know the theme song from The Beverly Hillbillies.
	Lead follow or get out of the way.

	Time has been transformed and we have changed; it has advanced and set us in motion; it has unveiled its face inspiring us with bewilderment and exhilaration.
	As a matter of principle I never attend the first annual anything.
	I think men who have a pierced ear are better prepared for marriage. They&#39;ve experienced pain and bought jewelry.

	I am not judged by the number of times I fail but by the number of times I succeed; and the number of times I succeed is in direct proportion to the number of times I can fail and keep on trying.
	Why are people&#39;s &#39;&#39;deepest desires&#39;&#39; always so shallow?.
	The movies that are the easiest to make are the hardest to watch.
	Individual commitment to a group effort -- that is what makes a team work a company work a society work a civilization work.
	They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.
	The miracle is not that we do this work but that we are happy to do it.
	Your faith is what you believe not what you know.

	What makes us men is that we can think logically. What makes us human is that we sometimes choose not to.
	Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of the imagination.
	They defend their errors as if they were defending their inheritance.
	Experience has taught me that there is one chief reason why some people succeed and others fail. The difference is not one of knowing but of doing. The successful man is not so superior in ability as in action. So far as success can be reduced to a formula it consists of this: doing what you know you should do.
	The beginning is the most important part of the work.

	
	Cowardice asks the question &#39;Is it safe?&#39; Expediency asks the question &#39;Is it politic?&#39; Vanity asks the question &#39;Is it popular?&#39; But conscience asks the question &#39;Is it right?&#39; And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but one must take it because one&#39;s conscience tells one that it is right.
	Nothing gives one person so much advantage over another as to remain always cool and unruffled under all circumstances.
	An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered; an adventure is an inconvenience rightly considered.

	There is but one straight course and that is to seek truth and pursue it steadily.
	An atheist is a man who has no invisible means of support.
	Some regard private enterprise as if it were a predatory tiger to be shot. Others look upon it as a cow that they can milk. Only a handful see it for what it really is--the strong horse that pulls the whole cart.
	We should not criticise those who trip by taking a more difficult than usual step.
	Friends have all things in common.

	The most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish your feelings - words shrink things that seem timeless when they are in your head to no more than living size when they are brought out.
	I&#39;d just as soon play tennis with the net down.
	I just finished my first book. Pretty soon I&#39;m gonna read another.

	Friendship like the immortality of the soul is too good to be believed. When friendships are real they are not glass threads or frost work but the solidest things we know.

	Anything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung.

	We&#39;ve had bad luck with our kids - they&#39;ve all grown up.

	Fear is your best friend or your worst enemy. It&#39;s like fire. If you can control it it can cook for you; it can heat your house.

	Women cannot complain about men anymore until they start getting better taste in them.
	A Canadian is someone who knows how to make love in a canoe.

	A shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases.
	Money can help you to get medicines but not health. Money can help you to get soft pillows but not sound sleep. Money can help you to get material comforts but not eternal bliss.

	The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we are but in what direction we are moving.
	Poetry is what gets lost in translation.
	The buck stops here.

	Lost time is never found again.
	On Thanksgiving Day we acknowledge our dependence.
	When they tell me I&#39;m too old to do something I attempt it immediately.
	It is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love and never talk to them of our own neccessities but of their advantages.
	Sin lies only in hurting other people unnecessarily. All other &#39;sins&#39; are invented nonsense.
	Washington is a city of Southern efficiency and Northern charm.
	If you can&#39;t imitate him don&#39;t copy him.

	I have ever deemed it more honorable and more profitable too to set a good example than to follow a bad one.
	A very quiet and tasteful way to be famous is to have a famous relation. Then you can not only be nothing you can do nothing too.

And he puzzled and puzzled &#39;till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn&#39;t before. What if Christmas he thought doesn&#39;t come from a store? What if Christmas perhaps means a little bit more?.
	Less disappointing than life great works of art do not begin by giving us all their best.
	Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh since there is less cleaning up to do afterward.
	Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.
	Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love love love that is the soul of genius.
	The difference between the most dissimilar characters between a philosopher and a common street porter for example seems to arise not so much from nature as from habit custom and education.
	True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we.
	understand about life ourselves and the world around us.
