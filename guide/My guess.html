style="position:relative;" class="vt-doc guide" data-v-76579f7e><div><p>My guess is my brother would call his mom and his dad pretty regularly, a lot more than I probably did.</p><p>When I was 15, I worked at a dry cleaner because I wanted Abercrombie &amp; Fitch jeans. My mom told me I could have $20 jeans, not $70 jeans, unless I was willing to work for them. So I did!</p><p>Growing up my whole life, my mom was telling me how incredible and special I was and that I was going to change the world. I think it&#39;s important for girls to know that they can change the world, that they do have an impact.</p><p>I remember getting this scrapbook that this girl made, that I actually gave to my mom to hold onto because she has a &#39;Twilight&#39; shrine in their house in Florida. It was just this scrapbook of me, starting with &#39;Twilight,&#39; and the whole progression of me and my career throughout that, and other stuff that I had done in between.</p><p>My mom lived by herself with two kids. Sacrifice was the name of the game at our house.</p><p>My mom and dad just loved the fact that I fooled around. They just embraced it. They&#39;d always kind of enjoy it, and they liked it when I made them laugh.</p><p>Imagine my surprise when, after a lifetime of teaching me to keep personal things to myself, Mom insisted my drawings were the start of a comic strip for millions of people to enjoy.</p><p>Mothers send strips to daughters to make a point. Daughters smack strips down on the breakfast table to make a point. My own mom sometimes cuts a strip out and sends it to me to make sure I understand her.</p><p>The relationship between Cathy and Mom in the strip is the one relationship drawn from real life that I have proudly never even tried to disguise.</p><p>My mom, she is the most unbelievable mom that you could ever have in your entire life and she&#39;s always with me on everything. The most I&#39;ve ever been away from her is two days. I love her more than anybody could ever know.</p><p>I want to be a loving mom.</p><p>I want to be a mom who listens.</p><p>I am proud of my kids, but I also want to make my mom proud of me. I&#39;m still a momma&#39;s girl at the heart of the situation.</p><p>Sometimes I do envision just being a stay at home mom but not working isn&#39;t an option for me currently.</p><p>There are days when I struggle with wanting to be a full-time, stay-at-home mom, and feeling guilty about that because I work.</p><p>I got my first tattoo when I was 16 years old and I went with my mom to get it done - she has a bunch too so we&#39;re tattoo buddies now.</p><p>I think because I became a mom later in life, everything in life means more.</p><p>My mom was sarcastic about men. She would tell me Adam was the rough draft and Eve was the final product. She was a feminist minister, an earth mom who wore a bra only on Sundays.</p><p>I&#39;m a soccer mom. I&#39;m T-ball, soccer, karate, homework, keeping them on their schedules. I love being the snack mom, when I get to bring the cut oranges. I have one of those coolers with wheels. I&#39;m at every game, every practice, sitting on my blanket. I love it.</p><p>Many of my books come from what if questions that I can&#39;t answer, things that I&#39;m worried about as either a woman, a wife, a mom, an American.</p><p>My dad sold encyclopedias and my mom worked in a factory office.</p><p>My mom was a single mom, and she had enough on her plate. I knew when I was doing something I wasn&#39;t supposed to, and I tried to keep her from finding out about it. I did a pretty good job of that.</p><p>I&#39;m a better mother if I&#39;m also doing my work. Some women find a lot more satisfaction from doing the hardest job, which is being a mom. But I like my day job, so I juggle a lot.</p><p>My mom was a teacher - I have the greatest respect for the profession - we need great teachers - not poor or mediocre ones.</p><p>Being a mom makes me feel whole and like I understand the meaning of life.</p><p>There is nothing better than being a parent. It is the most challenging job one could ever ask for. I love being a mom and I love being a friend to my children as well.</p><p>My friends and I would get up early and take our horses through the national forest. My mom was very free. It was always &#39;Out of the house!&#39; There was no watching television on weekends.</p><p>I grew up with just my mom. She and I were like best friends. She&#39;s a very independent woman and I admire that about her. In my life, I&#39;ve tried to be like that. To be okay with being on my own and being independent.</p><p>You don&#39;t realize how hard it is to live on your own. But there&#39;s no mom to do your laundry, and make you dinner and to do things for you, and you don&#39;t think about little things like buying paper towels and salt.</p><p>I work too much to be an appropriate parent. I feel like a bad mom to my dog some days because I&#39;m just not here enough. I just feel like I would do a bad job if I took the time to literally give birth to a kid right now and try and juggle everything I&#39;m doing.</p><p>I live in, literally, the same home when I was swiping my first bank card and wondering if I&#39;d have to put back the Charmin. We still don&#39;t have a dishwasher. My mom has done all these gardens so now my house looks like the garden shack in the middle of Versailles.</p><p>My mom, who&#39;s been in the restaurant business for 40 years, is the number-one influence in my life. But I look up to a lot of people in the industry. Tops on my list is Mario Batali. My mom and Mario taught me the same lesson: Food is love.</p><p>Good food and a warm kitchen are what makes a house a home. I always tried to make my home like my mother&#39;s, because Mom was magnificent at stretching a buck when it came to decorating and food. Like a true Italian, she valued beautification in every area of her life, and I try to do the same.</p><p>I came from a broken home, so my mom was a major influence in my life.</p><p>I lived with my mom in a really small apartment. My bedroom was like in the living room. That&#39;s why I still love to sleep on couches now.</p><p>My mom is definitely my rock.</p><p>My mom always said, &#39;Don&#39;t date a guy who thinks he&#39;s prettier than you.&#39;</p><p>My mom was an actress in the local Seattle theater doing experimental plays.</p><p>Everything I am is because of my mom.</p><p>In a school where everyone is famous or rich or whatever, you have a culture, &#39;What does your dad do?&#39; &#39;What does your mom do?&#39;</p><p>We&#39;ve all seen the mom who devotes all her time and attention to her child and is so hungry for adult interaction that as soon as she&#39;s around another adult, she&#39;s not paying attention anymore.</p><p>My nickname for my mom was &#39;The Compass.&#39;</p><p>Well, you know, I was raised by a 1970s feminist. My mom had a consciousness-raising group. I used to sit at the top of the stairs and listen to them.</p><p>Grades were important in our house. I was reading by two. My mom would sit there and read with me, read with me, read with me. It was wonderful.</p><p>When I was growing up, my mother was always a friend to my siblings and me (in addition to being all the other things a mom is), and I was always grateful for that because I knew she was someone I could talk to and joke with, and argue with and that nothing would ever harm that friendship.</p><p>Dinner &#39;conversation&#39; at the Cohens&#39; meant my sister, mom, and I relaying in brutal detail the day&#39;s events in a state of amplified hysteria, while my father listened to his own smooth jazz station in his head.</p><p>If you go from a structure where you have the support and that partner and that construction of a family and that&#39;s broken apart, I think that&#39;s probably a lot harder than always being a single mom and having the father being a support in another area.</p><p>Ever since I was a little kid, I&#39;ve felt comfortable in a suit. It all started when my mom bought me a three-piece Pierre Cardin suit. I wore that thing everywhere. Eventually I realized I was going to be the kid who got beat up in school, but I kept wearing it.</p><p>I was blessed, because I come from a family where they knock you down before you float away. I have a lot of brothers who just make sure we have our feet on the ground, and my mom is a rock star. She is an amazing mother.</p><p>I spend my afternoons painting and working on my Open Hearts jewelry line for Kay Jewelers. I designed an image of a heart that isn&#39;t completely closed. My mom always told me to live with an open heart - when life gets tough, you should go out and help someone else.</p><p>What does good in bed mean to me? When I&#39;m sick and I stay home from school propped up with lots of pillows watching TV and my mom brings me soup - that&#39;s good in bed.</p><p>My mom passed away a day before high school started, and her dream was for me to be a full rock and roll guy, and play drums in a band.</p><p>My mom listened to the Beatles and Elvis, a lot of different types of music.</p><p>My mom died when I was 16. I had a rough childhood, you know what I mean, but it made me strong.</p><p>My mom was scared of the old Times Square so I was never allowed to go. Now I&#39;m scared of the new Times Square, so I still never go.</p><p>I&#39;m an immigrant kid who came to America from India when I was very young and grew up in New York City with a single mom and really was influenced by all of those immigrant cultures bumping up against each other.</p><p>I never Tweet about my daughter. Never. I just want to be respectful of her privacy. My job as a mom is to know when to open my mouth and when not to.</p><p>I think I&#39;m a really hands-on mom.</p><p>When I was a new mom, I used to think that life was going to be balanced, and I strived for that. But life is crazy!</p><p>My mom was a ventriloquist and she always was throwing her voice. For ten years I thought the dog was telling me to kill my father.</p><p>Wigs have always been a part of my life and have become a staple accessory in my closet. I can remember being a little girl and hearing all the commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and part of their everyday beauty routine.</p><p>My mom passed away at 41 from diabetes. And I&#39;m 42, thank you. I didn&#39;t want to do that to my son. So any time I was at the gym, that thing that helped me do that last squat was my son calling some other woman mommy. And that would just give me that extra oomph to do that last squat. I want to be around for him.</p><p>I don&#39;t spend a lot of time online. My mother&#39;s really good at picking out if she sees a really great review, and she&#39;ll forward it to me. She&#39;s like my little Internet filter. It&#39;s always nice to see something going up if I want to find something on Nathan Fillion, I do know where to look, but I&#39;ve got a nice little delivery system in my mom.</p><p>I listened to the radio, so I was influenced by everyone from Michael Jackson to Milli Vanilli. But thankfully my dad had a collection of Cat Stevens albums while my mom was listening to jazz.</p><p>I like to write and draw and paint, and my mom&#39;s an artist, so I think I get caught up in thinking, &#39;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s gonna be bad,&#39; and it&#39;s hard for me to start sometimes.</p><p>We never had a bathtub. Mom would bathe me in the wooden or tin washtub in the kitchen, or in a big lard can.</p><p>Mom was the greatest influence of my childhood. She wanted to save me from the vice, lust, and drinking that was all about me.</p><p>Mom never quit on me. My only regret is that she didn&#39;t live long enough to share some of the money and comforts my work in show business has brought me.</p><p>In her whole life Mom never earned more than five or six dollars a week. Being without a husband, it was hard for her to find any place at all for us to live.</p><p>That&#39;s the hardest thing about being a mom. You want to be cool, and you want them to like you all the time, but you can&#39;t always have that. You&#39;re gonna have times where you have to say no, and you won&#39;t be the most popular person in the house.</p><p>My mom used to have a lot of European cinema playing in the house, so I&#39;d catch bits and pieces of films.</p><p>Being a mom&#39;s so empowering and incredible. I&#39;m one of those people who believes that life brings things to you at a certain time for a certain reason, and if you just go with it, that&#39;s where the best moments come from.</p><p>I think my mom put it best. She said, &#39;Little girls soften their daddy&#39;s hearts.&#39;</p><p>I love my mom and dad.</p><p>Postpartum depression is a very real and very serious problem for many mothers. It can happen to a first time mom or a veteran mother. It can occur a few days... or a few months after childbirth.</p><p>My mom didn&#39;t let me play video games growing up, so now I do. Gaming gives me a chance to just let go, blow somebody up and fight somebody from another dimension. It&#39;s all escapism.</p><p>This is the place where anybody - like an African American kid raised by a single mom - can be president.</p><p>You can be good at technology and like fashion and art. You can be good at technology and be a jock. You can be good at technology and be a mom. You can do it your way, on your terms.</p><p>I slept with my mom until I was 16 years old.</p><p>If I could be a third of the woman that my mom is and have a third of the strength that she has, then I will have done good by this life.</p><p>It&#39;s always been my mom and I against the world.</p><p>I always wanted to be a young mom, but generations of women have worked so hard so we can have a career and wait to have children. So I say carpe diem - take advantage of that.</p><p>Home is where my mom is.</p><p>A company that pays attention to the family unit is a successful company. We don&#39;t isolate the family. We don&#39;t make rides that say, &#39;Hey mom, dad, you go sit on the bench.&#39;</p><p>I grew up in Marcy Projects in Brooklyn, and my mom and pop had an extensive record collection, so Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder and all of those sounds and souls of Motown filled the house.</p><p>He was doing - Ray was designing the clothes for my mom&#39;s show from California. And one of the first appearances I ever made on television was on my mother&#39;s show and Ray and Bob did the clothes for that. It has been a long time.</p><p>Sinatra was just one of Mom&#39;s friends.</p><p>My mom is not trying to live vicariously through me.</p><p>I was almost 8 years old when I was watching a kid on a TV commercial, and I told my mom that I wanted to do the same thing. She said that I would need to get an agent and that she would research it.</p><p>I&#39;d say that if you had a strained relationship with your mom, for whatever reason, the best thing to do is be open with each other, talk it over, try and work it out somehow as opposed to just putting a wall up and pushing them away.</p><p>My mom&#39;s a social worker, and my dad works in non-profit organisations.</p><p>For now I&#39;m just enjoying being a mom. I don&#39;t want to be more famous and more rich. I want to be a good mom.</p><p>My mom was truly an iconic figure, a great journalist and a pioneering woman who died at 54 of cancer without ever having revealed to viewers that she was ill.</p><p>My mom didn&#39;t want me to go to college. She didn&#39;t want me to read - when I read, I may as well have been holding a pineapple.</p><p>My beloved Mom and Pop always rated tops with each other, and that&#39;s the way it will always be.</p><p>Mom claimed that I could carry a tune at 2 or 3 years of age. Maybe she was a little prejudiced.</p><p>Mom and Pop were proud of my popularity, but from their point of view, show business was no way to make a living.</p><p>My mom was a professional. My dad and mom met each other in a movie called &#39;New Faces of 1937.&#39; My mom went under the name Thelma Leeds, and she did a few movies, and she was really a great singer, and when she married my dad and started to have a family, she sang at parties.</p><p>I had a non-existent knowledge of Queen Victoria&#39;s early years. Like everyone else, I thought of her as an old lady dressed in black. My mom had told me about her, though, that she had a very loving relationship with Albert, that they had lots of kids, and that he died young.</p><p>I&#39;m so proud to represent the people of South Florida. I was so honored when President Obama asked me to serve as chair of the Democratic Party. But there&#39;s one job I&#39;m even more proud of, and that&#39;s being a mom to my three kids, Rebecca, Jake and Shelby.</p><p>I have great faith that Heaven&#39;s there and I&#39;ll see my brothers and my mom and dad when I get there.</p><p>My mom was amazing. She believed in me and we were best friends.</p><p>My mom was a seamstress, and I wish I&#39;d learned to sew because I&#39;m obsessed with &#39;Project Runway!&#39;</p><p>If I have any talent at all it&#39;s from God, and my mom, who was on Capitol Records also.</p><p>My mom and dad got divorced when I was very young, and growing up in a family where the head of the household wasn&#39;t a man made a big difference.</p><p>I want to be a fun mom. Not a gasping for air mom.</p><p>Every kid needs to say, &#39;I want what my mom and dad have.&#39;</p><p>I could never have pictured myself writing a book when I was 25 years old. My mom was an English teacher but I wasn&#39;t that way growing up.</p><p>My mom obviously had a problem.</p><p>It&#39;s been very hard, after being mostly a mom, to develop an adult life of my own. And not being married anymore, I have to come up with challenges.</p><p>I grew up painting and playing piano so when I was a little kid I thought I was going to be an artist or a painter but my mom had me taking piano lessons for about 10-12 years as a young kid.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had siblings, I didn&#39;t grow up in a big family it was just me and my single mom. And hectic family dysfunction was actually something that I craved.</p><p>I grew up in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood, but my mom is Filipino-Spanish and my dad is Irish.</p><p>I look at my father. He is one of my heroes. He is such an incredible, classy man. He was such a great father and such a great husband in so many ways, and we lived through some pretty tough times losing my mom. When I see all that he did, I think, &#39;Wow, that&#39;s a really wonderful man.&#39;</p><p>AIDS can destroy a family if you let it, but luckily for my sister and me, Mom taught us to keep going. Don&#39;t give up, be proud of who you are, and never feel sorry for yourself.</p><p>My parents are wonderful, and I&#39;m really lucky - but my mom has always been almost exclusively a right-brained person.</p><p>Also, my mom and family are very important to me and I know that this is not expected.</p><p>I shoplifted. I was about five years old, and I took a candy from a store. We paid for three of them, but I took four, and I went home and cried. My mom took me back, and I paid for the missing piece.</p><p>I had to take my makeup off at work every night. I wasn&#39;t allowed to do it at home because my mom said that when your work day is done, you&#39;re done with work.</p><p>When you think of couponing, you picture a mom cutting coupons out of the back of the newspaper.</p><p>I&#39;m a military kid, both parents in the military - Mom did 12 years, Dad did 21, served in two wars. So discipline is something that was huge.</p><p>It&#39;s fun to play mom. Last I knew I was playing a 17-year-old who graduated.</p><p>I always say I am a realist, and my mom says, &#39;No, you just have anxiety.&#39;</p><p>I wanted to perform well for my mom and dad, because in high school, I didn&#39;t have a job. My brothers, they worked at Pizza Hut or places like that, but sports, that was my way of giving back.</p><p>All of us kids ended up &#39;doing Mom.&#39; There are four of us who&#39;ve tried show business. Five if you insist on counting my sister the nun, who does liturgical dance.</p><p>I was class mom at the preschool one year and I was pretty much asked not to do that again!</p><p>It was my mom and I against the world. We lived in New York in this bohemian lifestyle where an extended group of artists and photographers were like my aunts and uncles.</p><p>My parents divorced when I was young but I was brought up in two really loving households. I didn&#39;t have a contentious relationship with my mom or dad.</p><p>Country was about character. Country&#39;s changed because of monsters like Clear Channel who bought up all the stations and sliced them up into formats. Our demographic is now the soccer mom.</p><p>I have lots of records, quite a collection, actually, that I stole from my mom. I have the original &#39;Thriller&#39; album and I have a really great &#39;Elton John&#39;s Greatest Hits,&#39; and I also have a N.E.R.D. album. Records sound more original. They have more edge.</p><p>My mom and dad worked very hard to give me the best chance in - not just in golf but in life. You know, I was an only child, you know, my dad worked three jobs at one stage. My mom worked night shifts in a factory.</p><p>Dad and mom would have preferred that I be a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist, or a great humanitarian.</p><p>I think a good mom is an awake mom. At least for me, I&#39;ve always been a kinder, better person awake than sleep-deprived!</p><p>My mom was a great cook and great baker all her life.</p><p>No, my mom kind of led me toward acting. She wanted to be an actress when she was younger. That made me interested in it when I was a kid, because she and I are very close.</p><p>For many women, going back to work a few months after having a baby is overwhelming and unmanageable. As strange as it may seem, things get even more difficult for a working mom after the second and third baby arrive. By that time, the romance of being a modern &#39;superwoman&#39; wears off and reality sets in.</p><p>One of my most sentimental items is my grandmother&#39;s engagement ring that my mom gave me a few years ago. It&#39;s a Victorian-style setting that&#39;s closed in the back, so it doesn&#39;t sparkle the way diamonds do now. I wear it as a pendant.</p><p>Once you&#39;re a mom, always a mom. It&#39;s like riding a bike, you never forget.</p><p>My mom was always really healthy and cautious about her diet, so I&#39;m not a big sugar guy.</p><p>My mom&#39;s hot. I mean she&#39;s old, but my mom&#39;s out of control.</p><p>We busted a lot of family secrets with this. But to make a long story short, my parents relationship was built heavily on security issues for my Mom, and when my Dad couldn&#39;t provide security, the relationship unraveled.</p><p>My mom took me to a Dolly Parton concert when I was 3.</p><p>One time my mom tried to ground me, but that lasted 15 minutes.</p><p>OK, so my parents were married in 1955 and my mom knew my dad was gay and my dad knew he was gay and so I was, like, &#39;Why in the heck did you get married?&#39; Like, what was going on? What was that time? It&#39;s like this crazy paradox that my whole life is based on, or my family&#39;s based on. So I spent a lot of time trying to understand &#39;55.</p><p>My daughter&#39;s name is Neesyn Dacey but everyone calls her Dacey. Her mom chose Neesyn and I chose Dacey after she was born. The mother is a good friend of mine who I was seeing a while ago. We are no longer together.</p><p>My mom played the recorder. But not having electricity, we had minimal exposure to music. As I got a little older, we had Walkmans and things that were battery-powered, but it would have been nice to be growing up in the iPod era. A tape only has six songs on a side.</p><p>It&#39;s so funny looking back, but my so-called overnight success actually took 15 years. I remember when I didn&#39;t have any money, and my only car was mom&#39;s Hyundai.</p><p>As a small business owner for the last 15 years, when I think of what truly changed my life, it was my faith, a strong family, my mom did a really, really good job of encouraging me in very clear and discernible ways.</p><p>When you&#39;re sick, nobody takes care of you like your mom.</p><p>We didn&#39;t have movies in this little mining town. When I was 12 my mom took me to New York and I saw Bye Bye Birdie, with people singing and dancing, and that was it.</p><p>I gave guitar lessons. I tried to join bands. My mom always said it was obvious that nothing was going to stop me.</p><p>Before you&#39;re a mom you don&#39;t know what gear is going to be relevant.</p><p>My mom and my dad were married 56 years, and the fact that I reconciled with my dad I think made their marriage a little bit better as well.</p><p>I was embarrassed that I even wanted to become an actress because coming from L.A., with two older sisters in the business and a mom who had been a ballet dancer, it was such a cliche.</p><p>From the very start of all of this, my mom has read the scripts first. And if she liked something, she let me read it. She told our agent what kinds of parts that we would want.</p><p>I had no idea of the size of my bank account as a teen, and I didn&#39;t care to know. That was my mom&#39;s job, I figured that I would just find out when I turned 18. If you can&#39;t trust your mom, then who can you trust?</p><p>My mom, she&#39;s still always there for me. Always.</p><p>When I was growing up in New Jersey, my mom would regularly take my sister and I into the city to see shows. I have many fond memories of standing in the half-price ticket line in Times Square and going to matinees.</p><p>More and more couples are having this negotiation or discussion, but I&#39;m still amazed at the number who aren&#39;t and where the cultural norm sort of kicks in and they just assume that mom&#39;s got to be the one who stays home, not dad.</p><p>My mom had started to go to work when I was nine or ten, so I was aware of women trying to find their own identities by working. But I was still influenced by men to such an extreme. I wanted to play their games and wanted to compete in their world and be like them.</p><p>My mom had this romantic notion of her children playing classical music. The idea is you learn it when you&#39;re still learning language. It&#39;s using the same part of the brain.</p><p>I burnt myself out of skating. I was ready to focus on being a mom.</p><p>I&#39;ve realized how precious life is. When I was younger, I was more adventurous. I felt invincible. I was game for everything. As a mom, I don&#39;t want to get injured because then I can&#39;t take care of my kids.</p><p>I lived in small town out in the desert and my friend used to steal his mom&#39;s car in the middle of the night. He&#39;d drive over to my house, I&#39;d sneak out and we&#39;d go out to the desert and just burn things down.</p><p>My mom&#39;s gonna be the biggest star - mark my words right now!</p><p>My house has always been like everyone&#39;s house. You walk in, you&#39;re a part of the family, no matter who you are, what celebrity status you are, everyone is treated the same - with love from my mom.</p><p>So, I remember when I was a kid, I was waiting for my mom to come home when she was working late, and, you know, I was like, &#39;Oh my God, what happened to her? Is she OK? Did something happen to her getting in the car?&#39; I was a little kid. But those are actually early onsets of anxiety.</p><p>I got a family house for everybody to live in - my mom, my sisters and I. And I made sure that it has a separate apartment downstairs for myself. Family is more important than anything. We don&#39;t come from any money. So once I get them settled in, in a nice house, then I&#39;ll branch out and see if I can get something else.</p><p>My mom said, &#39;Don&#39;t get married. You&#39;re too young. Go out there and experience what life has to offer.&#39; And I did.</p><p>I&#39;m kind of lucky that we&#39;ve finished shooting &#39;Cougar Town,&#39; so I&#39;m able to kind of just enjoy my pregnancy and be a stay-at-home mom and go to prenatal Pilates and do all that fun stuff that, if I were working, would be almost impossible to do.</p><p>Birdie is amazing and such an incredible child and I&#39;m having such a great time being a mom but I still want to have a career and I still look forward to auditions and parts, and when I don&#39;t get them I&#39;m disappointed.</p><p>I&#39;m somebody who doesn&#39;t work with a stylist. I&#39;ll be honest with you, I&#39;m a mom and it&#39;s just not something I want to put money toward because it&#39;s expensive to have somebody who helps dress you and I feel like I have to pay for preschool and so many things... so I don&#39;t have a stylist.</p><p>Mom always tells me to celebrate everyone&#39;s uniqueness. I like the way that sounds.</p><p>My mom taught me not to talk about money.</p><p>I love my mom. I totally look up to her, and she just doesn&#39;t let anybody take advantage of me. People might call that a stage mom.</p><p>My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through, like when you&#39;re 13 and you think you&#39;re too cool for your parents. When you&#39;re embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.</p><p>My mom had me when she was 16, and I was an only child, which is probably why I received a lot of love and didn&#39;t miss that my father wasn&#39;t around.</p><p>Miami Beach - that&#39;s where I grew up, in a middle-class Jewish family led by my maternal grandfather. Me, my great-grandmother - a Holocaust survivor, who was my roommate - my grandparents, my mom and her brother all shared a four-bedroom house.</p><p>We didn&#39;t have a TV in the living room and all my friends thought we were kind of weird. When they&#39;d come over, my mom wanted to talk to them about current events.</p><p>My mom is this liberal, feminist, Mormon powerhouse. I just love her to death.</p><p>I was raised in Boston by three older brothers and a very strong and empowering single mom.</p><p>My mom is like this hard-core, liberal feminist. She&#39;s a professor in Boston, and she&#39;s been teaching women&#39;s studies for 30 years and international politics.</p><p>As a mom, I don&#39;t have much time for beauty.</p><p>My biggest project right now is trying to be a really great mom and learning how to balance family and career. I&#39;m just trying to spend as much time with my family as I can.</p><p>I&#39;m a mom - I&#39;m lucky if I get to shower in the morning. Luckily, nail polish stays on my toes. I&#39;ve been so bad on the upkeep, though.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to be a mom.</p><p>I want my daughter to be proud of me and look up to me. I think early on in my pregnancy I realized that to be the mom I want to be, I had to change my life, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.</p><p>My mom and dad played this music all the time when I was growing up, so to me songs by Jerry Lee and Fats Domino are the classics, they&#39;re the best songs ever.</p><p>I was brought up as an only child, and we were very close. But when I was 14, we got evicted. We came home to a padlock, and I looked up at my mom and she was crying, and there was nothing to do.</p><p>I spend as much time with my kids as any mom who stays home. I only work during the hours they&#39;re at school, but there is always the sense of trying to catch up with all their stuff and not only organize my work life but also their school lives.</p><p>My mom&#39;s the one I look up to for everything. I feel like I&#39;m a lump of clay and she&#39;s moulding me into a woman.</p><p>My mom has always said that if I get a big head, she&#39;ll take me out of this business as quickly as I got into it.</p><p>I just got my phone back yesterday. My mom had it for two days. I was supposed to read a book and I really wanted to play Call Of Duty.</p><p>My mom won&#39;t let me buy high-fashion stuff unless it&#39;s TK Maxx or a birthday occasion.</p><p>The one thing my mom will let me get is a nice shoe sometimes.</p><p>My mom won&#39;t let anyone treat me like a little princess.</p><p>My brother Trevor is theatrically trained. I used to watch him when I was younger and I was in love with it. It just seemed really fun to be someone else. So I begged my mom she was hesitant, but she eventually allowed me. And it turned out well, I guess.</p><p>My mom gives me an allowance. She keeps me pretty tight-reined.</p><p>The problem with me is, anything that&#39;s easy I will just overdo it. Especially with clothes. But I&#39;m 14 - my mom is super-strict about that.</p><p>We were poor. But my mom never accepted that. She worked hard to become a residential contractor - got her master&#39;s with honors at the University of New Orleans. I used to go to every class with her. Her father was my paternal figure.</p><p>I&#39;ve learned that every working mom is a superwoman.</p><p>I&#39;m an actress and mom, and I probably don&#39;t have enough of an active spiritual life. And I don&#39;t know why people run around calling themselves by the names of religions when they don&#39;t actually practise them.</p><p>My mother was a single mom, and most of the women I know are strong.</p><p>I think I&#39;ve become more like my mom just because of what we&#39;re both interested in, children and teaching and writing.</p><p>I had always loved to write and my mom was my editor for my school papers.</p><p>My mom&#39;s a secret Rastafarian.</p><p>I&#39;m more like my father, personality-wise. But my mom and I get alone really well - obviously, because my mom and my dad get along so well.</p><p>I&#39;m sure there were times when I wish I had thought, &#39;Gosh, that might really embarrass mom and dad,&#39; but our parents didn&#39;t raise us to think about them. They&#39;re very selfless and they wanted us to have as normal of a college life as possible. So really, we didn&#39;t think of any repercussions.</p><p>I prefer to imagine that my wife, a few friends, and occasionally my mom are the only ones who read what I do, though I realize that this is somewhat unrealistic.</p><p>When I was a kid, my mom used to run the vacuum cleaner, and the noise would bother me so much that I would run into the woods to calm down. I feel like that vacuum cleaner has been on since I moved to New York City.</p><p>There&#39;s been times when I&#39;ve had heartbreaking moments and I&#39;m like, &#39;I can&#39;t believe you said that,&#39; or &#39;I can&#39;t believe you did that&#39;. And it hurts, it still hurts, and it&#39;ll always hurt, but I&#39;ve never had somebody that I truly cared about just walk out on me, whether it was a boyfriend, or an aunt, mom or dad.</p><p>My mom would take me to restaurants, and the first thing I&#39;d ask for would be a pen and a napkin, and I&#39;d sketch shoes and shoes and shoes.</p><p>My mom would put me in these preppy little suits and slick my hair to the side. I have these baby pictures of me where I&#39;m this little preppy kid with a sweater tied around my neck.</p><p>I was a hyper kid in school and the teacher suggested to my mom she needed to do something with me.</p><p>My mother kept asking me, &#39;When are you going to do a gospel album?&#39; And I&#39;ve always wanted to do a gospel album. Everybody was going on about it, so mom started hounding me more.</p><p>My dad is a bank president and my mom was an accountant and they didn&#39;t think that seeking the life of a freelance writer was very practical, you see. Of course, I was just as determined to do it.</p><p>I know that I&#39;m getting the real deal with my mom. I know that she&#39;s telling it like it is. She&#39;s proud of me when I&#39;ve earned it and she&#39;s disappointed in me when I&#39;ve earn that. She&#39;s really my spectrum on where I am as a person.</p><p>I had such a great mom and I know that I&#39;d never be that mom. I wouldn&#39;t want to bring a child into this world unless I could be.</p><p>My mom calls me an older soul because, growing up, she taught me stuff real early. Now I spend most of my time chasing wisdom, chasing understanding.</p><p>Mom thinks I live in this dream world where everybody&#39;s Ivana Trump.</p><p>Over the years my mom has become a self-taught Biblical scholar.</p><p>My mom used to tell me: &#39;It&#39;s not what you weigh it&#39;s what you look like.&#39;</p><p>My mom and my father&#39;s birthday are on the same day.</p><p>My mom was dying for me to write a book, she was my biggest advocate.</p><p>Growing up, my mom was very strict about how I dressed and how I behaved, and I said to myself that I wasn&#39;t going to be like that. But now I know I&#39;m going to be exactly like my mom. I&#39;m going to be worse!</p><p>Sure, my childhood was unusual. All these eccentric, wild people frequented our home: rock stars, drag queens, models, bikers, freaks. But I was not this little rich girl. My mom and I lived in an apartment.</p><p>My mom&#39;s been married three times my dad has been married a lot. I didn&#39;t really see my dad that much.</p><p>I want to make my music and be a happy woman, a good wife, a good mom and one day hopefully have a child of my own.</p><p>My dad is a very quick-witted, sarcastic, dry, humorous guy, whereas my mom&#39;s very silly, and that side of the family is very musical.</p><p>Once my mom passed away, I have nobody to answer to. It&#39;s great.</p><p>My mom really instilled in me that I&#39;m beautiful and I can do anything, and I echo that now with my own girls.</p><p>I love kids and children, and I love being a mom.</p><p>I was actually the one who decided to move to LA. Mom and I were driving on Sunset Boulevard during one of our trips back to see her family, and I said, &#39;Can we just stay?&#39; So we did.</p><p>I&#39;m a competitive person and it is in my nature to try hard in every match I play. The only time I&#39;m not competitive is when I&#39;m playing against my mom.</p><p>One day my dad would say, &#39;OK, if you want to play tennis I can help you out.&#39; And that&#39;s how it started. And I had a goal. I wanted to beat my mom first. And my parents and my brother. And that was the ultimate goal.</p><p>My mom was always the support. I can always go out to her and she&#39;ll always find the positive in things.</p><p>My mom is great and I make sure that we pray together before every race. She helps me put everything in perspective and remind me of the real reason I run.</p><p>No matter what, like, I couldn&#39;t - I could break a world record, get an Olympic gold medal, and my mom would be, like, you could have done better. But you looked pretty. That&#39;s what she says all the time.</p><p>I care so passionately about improving the quality of life for women and girls, not just here in the United States, but internationally as well. I am a single mom and I raised a daughter who is now a young adult.</p><p>The fact that I&#39;m very close with my past relationships is something I pride myself on. My mom is still close to her first husband. It&#39;s nice to be able to enjoy someone in a different form.</p><p>I have to keep reminding myself that I am their mother. Sometimes we are sitting at home and I feel like we are waiting for our mom to come home.</p><p>When I was a child, I wanted to be an actor, but I had really bad buckteeth. I didn&#39;t want to get braces, but my mom said I couldn&#39;t be an actor if I didn&#39;t get the braces. So, I got the braces.</p><p>Our last jam session was this past Christmas. Dad played his harmonica, mom sang in English and Italian, and I played guitar. I&#39;m so happy that we could share that musical experience for one last time.</p><p>&quot;My mom cooked pot roast with noodles and frozen vegetables. Or she&#39;d make spaghetti or hot dogs, or heat up TV dinners. Before I started modeling at age 19, I was 5&#39;8&quot;&quot; and weighed 165 pounds.&quot;</p><p>My father still is a lawyer, and my mom was a teacher and then later a career counselor.</p><p>I remember that at the beginning of the month, the kind of menus my mom and father would prepare for us would have fish, chicken. But at the end of the month - because my father would be waiting for paycheck - the refrigerator would get empty. I remember that without a lot of food left, some of the best meals happened right there.</p><p>Simon is cool. You know, it&#39;s different if you ever see him around his mom. He acts totally different.</p><p>I want to make sure I continue to make good music that my mom and everybody around me can be proud of.</p><p>I grew up in the &#39;80s, and there was no bigger group than New Edition in R&amp;ampB. I broke my piggy bank so me and my mom could go to a New Edition concert together.</p><p>I&#39;m from Tennessee. My mom lives in Nashville. I&#39;m born and bred country. That&#39;s all I listen to.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had my brows done - I tweeze them myself. I used to watch my mom pluck her brows, that&#39;s how I learned.</p><p>My mom is a sculptress.</p><p>My hero is Michelle Williams, who I grew close to when we did &#39;Meek&#39;s Cutoff.&#39; She&#39;s an extraordinary actor and mom.</p><p>When I look up and see a star, I know my mom is there. She&#39;s with me all the time. It&#39;s a powerful connection.</p><p>My mom was an aesthetician and she went to beauty school back in the &#39;60s. I just remember watching her do her makeup all the time. She always had her nails done, makeup on - her face was ready to go when she went out. I loved it.</p><p>I grew up in a family of Republicans. And when I was 18 and registering to vote, my mom&#39;s only instruction was &#39;You just go in and pull the big Republican lever.&#39; That&#39;s my welcome to adulthood. She&#39;s like, &#39;No, don&#39;t even read it. Just pull the Republican lever.</p><p>My mom started smoking when she was 11. She went to the hill next door to try her first cigarette. She set the entire hill on fire, but it didn&#39;t deter her.</p><p>My memory of my mom is a wine glass in one hand and a cigarette in the other. She was a runway fashion model, and she was quite a glamorous woman.</p><p>I am blessed to have Mom and Dad.</p><p>I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I was not welcome anywhere.</p><p>I think I&#39;d be a great mom, honestly. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have any problem giving them all the love in the world. Discipline will be the hard part.</p><p>My mom will make me walk the dogs or take out the trash when I go home.</p><p>I am a single mom and I&#39;m the breadwinner and I have to work and I have to do these things and that&#39;s just the way it is. I don&#39;t think my son even knows any different.</p><p>Our parents are obviously proud, but they&#39;re still trying to get used to the fact that we&#39;re in a band. I have a feeling my mom would actually like One Direction if I wasn&#39;t in it!</p><p>My parents are both very funny but they&#39;re also relatively soft-spoken, normal human beings while I&#39;m just a lunatic. I don&#39;t know where this loud, ballsy, hammy ridiculousness came from. I&#39;m just glad I followed my goals and my parents did too. It&#39;s not like we even had a plan when I dragged my mom to Los Angeles.</p><p>I am excited to rise today to support National Mom and Pop Business Owners Day. This celebration honors the husband and wife business owner teams whose work helps drive the economy and fuel job growth.</p><p>I&#39;m a nice, happily married wife and mom and I live in Connecticut.</p><p>My dad was a golden gloves boxer in the Marine Corps, then a deputy sheriff. My mom worked as an office assistant.</p><p>My mom was a model. She had me at 20, so she was a young mother.</p><p>My mom and dad met at UCLA when he as a captain in the Air Force and she was in her junior year.</p><p>I&#39;ve always believed fitness is an entry point to help you build that happier, healthier life. When your health is strong, you&#39;re capable of taking risks. You&#39;ll feel more confident to ask for the promotion. You&#39;ll have more energy to be a better mom. You&#39;ll feel more deserving of love.</p><p>My dad left when I was 3 1/2, and he left my mom and I.</p><p>My mom used to take me down to the Jersey Shore when I was 7, 8, 9 years old. I can remember being down in that area - Belmar, Seaside Heights, Asbury Park and all those places that I went back and revisited.</p><p>Some of the best times I&#39;ve spent in Colorado have been in the backcountry with my mom and siblings, and more recently, with my own kids. That is why I&#39;m concerned to see today&#39;s kids spending more time browsing the Internet than exploring nature.</p><p>I like my name. My mom named me after a song by the 1970s group Bread. So, it&#39;s meaningful, and I like the song. It&#39;s a love song - kind of - but it&#39;s kind of depressing and dark.</p><p>I want to go to college to study journalism. I want to speak French fluently, to travel. My mom was a journalist and it&#39;s in my blood.</p><p>My mom loved to sing - and I&#39;ll go on record and say she was the worst singer ever. I&#39;d get up and move away from her!</p><p>I have many valentines. My mom and my sister and my directors. I got calls from all of them. And my friends. I respect what Valentine&#39;s Day stands for because it is about love.</p><p>I&#39;m a full-time mom right now and a part-time actress.</p><p>I was a single mom that raised two bright, beautiful, and compassionate girls.</p><p>I would go visit my mom on Sundays, and my brother was working on stuff. I&#39;d go in there and sing a little melody, then we started working with words and the next thing you know it was just born organically without really trying.</p><p>I was born in Texas and I lived there &#39;till I was 8. Then I moved to the Dominican Republic with my mom, lived there for two years and forgot every word of English I knew.</p><p>And what is a stage dad, or a stage mom? It&#39;s someone who&#39;s protective. That&#39;s all.</p><p>My dad&#39;s half-Lebanese, my mom is full Lebanese. I&#39;m three-quarters Lebanese. Irish-Lebanese.</p><p>Most young people haven&#39;t used their storytelling skills since they were 8 or 9 or 10 and wanted to persuade Mom and Dad to take them to the ball game.</p><p>My mom used to tell me stories at night, read books to me - and I read &#39;em over and over and over again. And you know what I learned from that? I went back and looked at everything - Why do I like reading the same stories over and over and over again? What, was I some kind of nincompoop? No - the narrative gave me connection with my mom.</p><p>Not that we didn&#39;t have close relationships with our parents - I&#39;m very close to my mom - but parents didn&#39;t think anything of going off for a few weeks and leaving their kids.</p><p>Mom and Dad would stay in bed on Sunday morning, but the kids would have to go to church.</p><p>Deep down, my mom had long suspected I was gay... Much of her anger and hurt came from her sense of betrayal that she was the last to be told.</p><p>What mom cares about most is that I&#39;m happy, healthy and enjoying my life.</p><p>My daily schedule is quite hectic, but I have to put my health first in order to be the best mom and wife I can be.</p><p>I told my mom I would graduate. I owe that much to her and myself.</p><p>My mom can&#39;t defend herself to the world. She is such an amazing woman, with such an open heart. It&#39;s a real hard line, and I crossed it. I took everyone&#39;s life story and assumed it would be a great thing to put on screen. I was being selfish and I feel so horrible about it. I feel so guilty.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been a writer because I&#39;ve always been a student. My mom&#39;s a retired professor, so I come from a very academic background. I love writing, you know?</p><p>My mom always encouraged me, it was never weird. She&#39;d look at &#39;Heavy Metal&#39; and go &#39;Woo-hoo!&#39;</p><p>You know, I loved math. My mom was a math teacher.</p><p>My mom sang in high school choir and so did my father.</p><p>I also think a Hot Mom is someone who can connect with what&#39;s current in her kids&#39; world.</p><p>Being a working mom is not easy. You have to be willing to screw up at every level.</p><p>As a mom, I always feel I have to protect them. I talk about them because they are the most important things in my life but they are private people. I won&#39;t use them for my own press.</p><p>It&#39;s hard either way, at home or on the bus, I think the hardest thing probably for me is going one second from being mom to right out on the stage and having to be that person too. It&#39;s hard to switch gears.</p><p>President Obama likes to talk about the Buffett Rule. Well, here&#39;s a Buffett Rule that all Americans should be able to support: mom and pop businesses should not pay a higher tax rate than Fortune 500 corporations like Warren Buffett&#39;s.</p><p>But my mom was a pianist, and she taught piano out of her house. I was just so excited, being a little kid and having all these other kids come to my house twice a week. I thought it was a big party.</p><p>My mom would give me a piece to play, but I wouldn&#39;t do any theory because when it came time to do it I would sneak back upstairs and watch TV. So, I had these kind of nonchalant lessons for years, then it just started soaking in.</p><p>The real beauty of it - key to my life was playing key chords on a banjo. For somebody else it may be a golf club that mom and dad put in their hands or a baseball or ballet lessons. Real gift to give to me and put it in writing.</p><p>I&#39;ve changed my life in a lot of ways. I&#39;m a mom, a wife, and a Christian. Some of the things I expressed in my early 20s aren&#39;t what I care to express right now.</p><p>My mom was a &#39;70s mom. She paved a road that no one had yet walked.</p><p>For me, just being how old I am, I know I don&#39;t want to be a single mom. I really would rather make it a two-person job. But I&#39;ve also come to terms with not being a mother at all. I&#39;m actually really good with either direction that my life can take as being a valid experience.</p><p>My mom didn&#39;t use face cream, like, nothing at all. She&#39;s got great skin and looks very youthful.</p><p>There&#39;s a book called &#39;The Shack&#39; - it had a lot to do with me coming full circle, meeting my birth mother. Awhile back, my birth mom and my adopted mom came to my show together, and it was pretty surreal.</p><p>When you&#39;re adopted, no matter what, you&#39;ve got issues with unconditional love. And you find out you&#39;re the product of the worst situation for a young girl to be in and start her life, and I&#39;m so grateful that my birth mom made the decision she made. She came from a rough situation.</p><p>I was a sickly baby, and after two sets of adoptive parents took me home, they returned me to the orphanage because of a serious respiratory infection. But as they say, the third time&#39;s a charm, because my mom and dad adopted me and took me into their home where I was raised in a family full of love.</p><p>Right now, it hasn&#39;t affected my music other than the fact that I don&#39;t have time to write any of it. That&#39;s no different from when I first started and I lived at home. I would play the guitar in the afternoon and then my mom or my dad would come home and I&#39;d have to quit.</p><p>My mom is many times responsible for getting us all together, but we trade off at each other&#39;s houses. My brother and I are actors and are traveling a lot of our job.</p><p>I wanted to have a personal life that I fully inhabited, not because I am such a great mom, but for me.</p><p>The most important thing in my father&#39;s life? World peace. Me and my brother. My mom.</p><p>I&#39;ve had Susan Sarandon play my mom, and now Lesley Ann Warren has played my mom, so if I could have Debra Winger play my mom, then I would have the trifecta of my favorite actresses playing my mother.</p><p>We always had &#39;Vogue&#39; in our house. But, when I was around 12, my Mom finally took me seriously about modeling and put a stack of magazines in front of me, then told me to study all the poses. The ones I loved the most were in &#39;Vogue.&#39;</p><p>My goal is to be a household name, and when I do that, I want to help other girls become models, and maybe even launch a fashion line with my mom, like Beyonce did with her mother. My mom has such a good eye, and it&#39;s always been a dream of hers.</p><p>When you&#39;re a mom and you have three children, nothing bothers you. Trust me. Who cares what people say? I&#39;ve got other things to deal with.</p><p>My mom was a saint. She taught me to be terminally nice.</p><p>I was who I was in high school in accordance with the rules of conduct for a normal person, like obeying your mom and dad. Then I got out of high school and moved out of the house, and I just started, for lack of a better term, running free.</p><p>I was always a closet lover of acting. My mom was very practical. She never, ever restricted our dreams, always told us we could do or be anything. Then I said, &#39;Maybe I want to be an actor&#39;. And she said, &#39;Maybe not that&#39;.</p><p>My mom is very Southern and she in real life says things like, &#39;If you&#39;ve got it, flaunt it.&#39;</p><p>Well, when I was a little girl we had 17 cats once. They all lived outside, and they kept having more kittens. My mom made us put little ribbons around each kitten&#39;s neck, put them in a wagon, and go door-to-door around the neighborhood to try to give them away.</p><p>I saw things at an early age because my mom was a theater actress. I did a play with her when I was 10 years old.</p><p>In Fargo, they say, well, that&#39;s a job. How well do you get paid? For example, for this book I was written about in Entertainment Weekly, and it was kind of cool because my mom asked me if Entertainment Weekly was a magazine or a newspaper.</p><p>Mom was the one who taught me unconditional love. With Dad, I&#39;d always felt there was something to live up to - expectations. But in the last year, we had a wonderful relationship.</p><p>Growing up with three older brothers and being the youngest and the only girl, my mom always made me tough. She&#39;s taught me over the years how to be a strong, independent woman, how to carry yourself in a positive way and anything that my brothers can do, I can do.</p><p>If I made a list of the people I admire, Mom would probably fill up half of it. She could do anything and everything.</p><p>I always had a standard of, back when I was doing the country music I always told people I would never record a song that I wouldn&#39;t sit down and sing in front of my mom and dad.</p><p>My mom did costumes for the Pointer Sisters.</p><p>I was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, the youngest of four girls, including my oldest sister, Lisa, who has special needs. My mom was a special education teacher, and my dad worked on the Army base. We weren&#39;t wealthy, but we were determined to succeed.</p><p>My mom was always the supplier of soccer balls, and so people were always knocking on my door, and trying to get me out so we could play.</p><p>I wanted to get us a place of our own with a little bit more space. The kitchen is just huge, because my mom... lives there, man, and she loves being in the kitchen.</p><p>I was looking to do something non-fiction because I had done a strip, &#39;My Mom Was a Schizophrenic.&#39; I really enjoyed the process of doing that strip, despite its subject matter. To do it I&#39;d had to do a lot of research and reading and I figured I&#39;d like to do that again.</p><p>My mom died when I was 8.</p><p>I&#39;m proud of what I look like. I&#39;m proud that I look like my mom.</p><p>You know when everyone&#39;s watching, your mom and dad, your friends in high school who thought they were better than you. You get your chance to get in the spotlight and shine.</p><p>I finished high school, moved to Nashville for college, and set out to break into the music business. Every night when I called home with news of my experiences, my mom and dad would encourage me to keep taking those small steps.</p><p>My mom has a good way of engaging me in a conversation about the choices I make, listening, being objective and open-minded, and respecting those choices so long as they don&#39;t put me in danger.</p><p>To this day, my mom&#39;s unsinkable spirit is an inspiration to me. For nearly thirty years, she&#39;s worked at the Library of Congress. Everyone knows Sameha simply as &#39;Sami.&#39; Along with 500 miles of shelved books, her closest friendships are cataloged in that library. They are as much the value of work to my mom as is the work itself.</p><p>I can&#39;t remember a time when my mom didn&#39;t work. She has forever been on the move: a go-getter. When my brother Adel and I had a paper route as kids, my mom would get up before us at the crack of dawn to drop off the Washington Post at different corners.</p><p>I have a very close relationship with my mom, and I&#39;m able to talk to her about anything.</p><p>Being an only child, I didn&#39;t have any other family but my mom and dad really, since the rest of my family lived quite far away from London.</p><p>My mom put me in a Pampers commercial on TV.</p><p>My mom was always pretty supportive. She saw me do plays and she&#39;d always act out the parts I did. My aunt, who played a big part in my life, was a little bit more reserved, because if they don&#39;t see you on TV every week they think you must be starving.</p><p>There are lots of different ways for women to be a mom in this culture.</p><p>My mom, she&#39;s a breast cancer survivor and because of that I had started getting mammograms once a year, starting at age 30.</p><p>My mom was at every single game I played as a kid, rain or shine.</p><p>Before becoming a mom, I never knew how good I had it to just spend time at a spa for a few hours. Now, those days are far and between. So when I have an hour, it&#39;s all about the mani and pedi.</p><p>There is nothing like becoming a mom to fill you with fear.</p><p>Trying to be Supermom is as futile as trying to be Perfect Mom. Not going to happen.</p><p>When I get a new script my mom will read them and just be aghast. I think it&#39;s hysterical.</p><p>I would forgive my mom, but she&#39;s going to have to admit she did some things that were wrong.</p><p>My mother and my grandmother are pioneers of Mexican cuisine in this country, so I grew up in the kitchen. My mom, Zarela Martinez, was by far my biggest influence and inspiration - and toughest critic.</p><p>My mom bought me a white Strat, but that wasn&#39;t what I wanted, so I went to a guitar store in Cleveland and - the guy told me it was a really good deal - made an even swap for a blue Teisco Del Ray. I loved that guitar and used it a bunch.</p><p>If I lived alone, Mom&#39;d never sleep because she wouldn&#39;t know I was okay.</p><p>I have a 16 year-old son, so I&#39;m now a soccer mom. I stand on the sidelines and I hear the things parents are saying, so I want them to understand what it is their kids are feeling in any sports environment.</p><p>My parents and my grandfather on my mom&#39;s side would travel the earth. They went to Australia and China, and they went to probably every soccer game I ever played.</p><p>I don&#39;t know that I have any role models now that are fixed. Definitely my mom - she&#39;s the coolest. She&#39;s worked really hard her whole life and I just think she&#39;s got a great attitude. Moms just know so much it&#39;s so silly.</p><p>My mom&#39;s one of 13 siblings, and they all got six kids, and till I was 13 everybody was in Compton.</p><p>I love playing moms. It&#39;s a lot easier than being a mom, I hear.</p><p>When I was 12 I cried to my mom, because I never got my letter to Hogwarts.</p><p>My mother smokes me out. We&#39;ll get these long periods of me thinking I&#39;m too busy to call her up or e-mail her, and she&#39;ll send me something. My mom&#39;s a real whiner. I love her to death, but she always sends me these &#39;woe is me&#39; things. I think she might be Jewish. I&#39;m not sure. She&#39;s Baptist-Jewish, which is a double whammy.</p><p>The rule with my mom was that the only way that I could be an actress when I was young was that I continued to go to public school and get straight A&#39;s in all my classes.</p><p>Death can&#39;t be so bad if mom went through it. It makes it easier for the child to follow.</p><p>My mom always said that if the Protestants catch a Catholic in their church, they feed them to the Jews.</p><p>I deal with postpartum feelings by reaching out to mom friends. I became very close with some of the women in my prenatal yoga class.</p><p>The first few weeks of being a mom were profound, not just emotionally but also, physically. All the changes you instinctually go through are miraculous.</p><p>When I was a kid and got in trouble, I&#39;d always say, Mom, I&#39;m in trouble. Well, Mom, I&#39;m in trouble.</p><p>As a busy working mom I&#39;m always pressed for time, so a quick and easy beauty routine is key!</p><p>My mom, the fabulous Bertie Kinsey, is an amazing seamstress. She quilts and sews and is so crafty. We call her the Southern Martha Stewart!</p><p>I think it&#39;s a tough road if you&#39;re a stay-at-home mom, a working mom, if you have a partner, if you don&#39;t. It&#39;s the best job in the world, and the toughest job in the world all at the same time.</p><p>My very sassy, older southern sister is very quick to point out that it&#39;s a luxury that my daughter gets to come to work with me. She does, and I have lunch with her every single day. My mom says I have &#39;high class problems.&#39;</p><p>Now that I&#39;m a mom, I&#39;m way more laid back. If you come into my house, don&#39;t look for a coaster. Forget it. There is not a piece of furniture in my house now that is too precious.</p><p>I&#39;m like any working mom.</p><p>But to sustain a marriage for 50 years, you have to get real a little bit and find someone who is understanding and who you can grow with. My mom always says, &#39;Marry the man who loves you a millimeter more.&#39;</p><p>I&#39;m talking like 10, 12 years old. Either junior brings Mom and Pop or Mom and Pop bring the kids. I&#39;m talking young here, not a college drinking crowd.</p><p>My mom, she&#39;s from Ireland, coached tennis in Nigeria when she was a missionary and turned me on to it when I was young.</p><p>Becoming a mom made me more contentious about expressing my true taste.</p><p>My mom was a source of strength.She showed me by example that women, regardless of how difficult life may get, can do it all.</p><p>My mom was definitely very strict with me.</p><p>I dyed my hair blonde when I was 14. My mom was not happy. But I love being blonde.</p><p>My mom&#39;s a Catholic, and my dad&#39;s a Jew, and they didn&#39;t want anything to do with anything.</p><p>Before I was a mom I used to think that parents who worried about their kids watching MTV were just clueless. Now that I&#39;m a mom, I see what the fuss was all about!</p><p>My mom FedExes a red velvet cake she makes from scratch to me every birthday.</p><p>I remember my mom dressed like Janis Joplin.</p><p>It was sort of just a family sport. My mom and dad were pretty keen golfers when I was young and so were my grandparents, and I just sort of tagged along with them.</p><p>I showed my mom the movie then I told her the movie got bought and that it was gonna be shown in theatres and be on video. Everyone was really psyched about it. Everyone in my little town of hounds started to call me movie star.</p><p>A Modern Mom to me is not always someone that juggles a career and family. A Modern Mom is a woman who takes care of herself on the inside and the outside.</p><p>I learned a lot from my Mom. My favorite lesson: remember there is no such thing as a certain way to parent and to remember that you are learning along with your child - it&#39;s ok to make mistakes.</p><p>There are days when I wonder why my mom couldn&#39;t be here to see this.</p><p>My mom was onstage when she was pregnant with me.</p><p>Of course, I would be depressed sometimes, and my Mom would be worried about me because I would just sleep to escape. Cause I was so scared of being a musician or artist, or whatever you want to call it.</p><p>I was into opera as a kid - I&#39;d play &#39;Carmen&#39; and sing and dance. My mom signed me up for a theater group before preschool, and I never looked back.</p><p>I begged my mom to let me start skating.</p><p>I would make my mom buy me the toy doctor kit.</p><p>I was born and raised in the high desert of Nevada in a tiny town called Searchlight. My dad was a hard rock miner. My mom took in wash. I grew up around people of strong values - even if they rarely talked about them.</p><p>I remember my mom saying to me that what your friends do is one thing, but what you do could be on the front page of the paper.</p><p>I&#39;ve looked at pictures that my mom has of me, from when I was four years old at the turntable. I&#39;m there, reaching up to play the records. I feel like I was bred to do what I do. I&#39;ve been into music, and listening to music and critiquing it, my whole life.</p><p>My mom has this great skiing event in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, every year for a local charity.</p><p>I suddenly had this really mad desire to have an affair with a woman. I was divorced. I was childless. I figured there&#39;s got to be one more way to really tick off my mom.</p><p>My mom is in her mid-60s and has more energy and is more youthful than any human being I know. It&#39;s pretty incredible.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I would have been able to stick with it and been proud of who I am and be feminine out on the court. I think I would have folded to the peer pressure if I didn&#39;t have my mom to encourage me to be me and be proud of how tall I am.</p><p>For me, being tall was very positive because I thought my mom was the most beautiful person ever.</p><p>My mom didn&#39;t ever think I would take to acting because I was a very shy, very reserved kind of child. But obviously, something changed!</p><p>I was watching TV at age 9 or 10, and my mom said that I came from the front room and I told her that I want to act. And she said if you want to do this at 18, then you can. It was a very simple story, yet, I do not even remember the conversation that I had with my mother. Until she reminded me of the story many years later.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to be an actress, ever since I was a little girl. I always played the mom and I played my sister as the daughter. I wanted to be an actress on television and movies instead of just around the house.</p><p>My dad named me Dakota and my mom came up with my first name Hannah. So it&#39;s Hannah Dakota Fanning.</p><p>I didn&#39;t really know what I wanted to do, and then I got this call from a casting director in Los Angeles. She remembered me from something years before, and she called my mom wanting me to audition for this thing.</p><p>My mom would be leaving the house and she&#39;d say, &#39;Don&#39;t you pull out all of the old dresses in the attic and put on a show again!&#39; And the door would close, and that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;d do. The show was calling me!</p><p>I do believe that there are African Americans who have thick accents. My mom has a thick accent my relatives have thick accents. But sometimes you have to adjust when you go into the world of film, TV, theatre, in order to make it accessible to people.</p><p>My mom once lost track of me at the zoo and when she found me I was lecturing a man about the difference between dromedary and Bactrian camels. I was about 3 1/2.</p><p>Work ethic has always been stressed in my family. My dad is going to be 80 years old and he still works part time. My mom just retired a couple years ago and she&#39;s in her mid- to late 70s.</p><p>I was home-schooled, was always very close with my mom and was very straight-laced and square. I was never the rebellious one, and I never threw hissy fits.</p><p>I was 3 when I told my mom that I knew what my dharma was and that I wanted to be an actor.</p><p>For a kid who&#39;s lost his mom and all the rage and grief that no one was able to talk out of me, football was a very therapeutic sport. Very.</p><p>I wanted to marry a girl just like my mom.</p><p>But the fact is, I&#39;m not work-identified. I&#39;m not a lawyer or a writer. I&#39;m a mom, and I&#39;m a woman, and that&#39;s the kind of people I want to see in books in the starring role.</p><p>My father left... but I tell my mom - and I told my mom this when I was a kid - I said, &#39;You know what, Mom? Good thing he left because you&#39;re a strong woman.&#39;</p><p>When I came out of my mom&#39;s womb, I had &#39;sitcom&#39; stamped on my forehead.</p><p>I played with dolls until I was 15. My mother encouraged it because my older sister got married when she was 15, so Mom thought that the longer I stayed with dolls, the better.</p><p>I&#39;m probably a little more like my dad. But because of my mom, I never saw being a woman as being an impediment to being able to do something. She had her Ph.D. before I was born.</p><p>My brother Jim and I spent many wonderful summers working on dairy farms in Wisconsin owned by Mom&#39;s cousins, and as members of our local Boy Scout troop.</p><p>When Queer Eye hit, the church told my mom they were praying for me. She said, God loves him too. And I support him 100 percent.</p><p>My mom doesn&#39;t get the whole gay thing, but she loves me.</p><p>I had said to some pastor that I was having thoughts, and the church turned on me. They went to my mom and said, So sorry about your son.</p><p>I am a mom as well as a senator!</p><p>I had so many offers after &#39;True Blood&#39; for things that were someone in the same vein, but nowhere near Alan Ball&#39;s vision. Or something that was over-the-top and fantastical. And I&#39;ve always wanted to play the regular, working-class mom, and I&#39;ve never really had the chance to do that.</p><p>I&#39;d never really babysat. I feel like I&#39;m Blair, or &#39;Gossip Girl.&#39; A teenager, basically - and now suddenly I&#39;m a mom?</p><p>I always wanted to be a mom.</p><p>When my dad was badly weakened by the flu and my mom wanted to call an ambulance to take him to the emergency room, he wouldn&#39;t go unless he could shave first and change into a nice shirt and a pair of slacks.</p><p>I don&#39;t deal with death very well. My brother, John Candy, my dad, my mom, Brandon Tartikoff just a couple of weeks ago. I mean, you lose a lot of people in your life, and that&#39;s one thing I am constantly working on - pain management.</p><p>Every family is different. I am mom and I am dad and I&#39;m going to do my best. You should be proud, walk through life saying I have the coolest family. I am part of a modern family.</p><p>I would borrow my mom&#39;s red Borghese lipstick and smear it on like a clown!</p><p>There was a point - when I was a kid - where I said I wanted to be like Luke Skywalker, with blond hair and blue eyes. My mom right there told me to never be ashamed of who I am.</p><p>I got tackled once in a movie theater. I was with my mom and brother, and then suddenly I got hit from behind and sort of sprawled out on the candy counter.</p><p>For example, I loved English and history at school. I would have loved to have done a degree in either. But my Mom said I didn&#39;t have time for university.</p><p>I&#39;ve had to adapt my wardrobe to my various roles, both at the office, as a mom, and for television. When I shop for the season I look for pieces that will suit every facet of my daily life, not just one single occasion.</p><p>Married and divorced, three beautiful daughters, two in college. The other one is 16, lives with her mom. I&#39;m 46, I&#39;ve worked for the Post Office for 18 years, seven facilities in three states.</p><p>I naturally wanted to be saved, so when I came home I told my mom I wanted to be confirmed. That&#39;s the way I related to it, being raised an Episcopalian. I went to Dallas and got confirmed.</p><p>I heard the Beatles and the Stones, and Mom bought me an electric guitar. I played lead for four years and then switched to bass. One day someone suggested that I should sing, so I sheepishly stepped up to the microphone and the rest is rock history.</p><p>I wanted to be an astronaut and wanted to go to space camp, but then I found out that I was too short to become an astronaut. My mom really made me believe that if I worked hard enough and if I really wanted to do it, I could do it.</p><p>My mom always made sure I lived my life as a regular kid.</p><p>I had ridiculous amounts of energy. Mom&#39;s like, you&#39;re driving me crazy - do you want to try gymnastics? From the moment I started it, I loved it and it kind of was like storybook from there.</p><p>My mother stopped working when she had my brother. She was a full time mom until I started getting heavily into ice skating lessons, and it got to the point where they really needed my mom to earn an income.</p><p>I didn&#39;t really get into golf until I was about 14. My mom and dad were taking lessons from a pro an hour and a half from our farm in Cohuna, Australia. When they got home, I&#39;d ask my mom to explain everything they learned - drills and all.</p><p>My mother was predominately a stay-at-home mom.</p><p>No, like I said, my dad was never really part of the tennis. His involvement around what I did with the tennis and with my mom and my grandparents was really not a part of my life.</p><p>I think my mom threatened to put me up for adoption a few times.</p><p>At 3 years old, I was imitating and doing fun little commercials for the family. Then at 5, I knew, &#39;OK, this is something I really like.&#39; At 8, I was crying in front of the mirror and my mom was like, &#39;Oh boy, here we go. We know what she&#39;s going to do.&#39;</p><p>I never liked apples. In fact, when I was a little girl, my mom wanted to give me apples in my lunch box and I would ask for green peppers. So bizarre... It&#39;s funny - I don&#39;t have an apple a day, but I can say that I have a few a week.</p><p>My mom and father are extremely proud. They love it when I don&#39;t die. I&#39;ve done so many movies where I&#39;ve died that their first question when I book a job is, &#39;So, are you going to die in this?&#39;</p><p>My mom has a tape from when I was, like, 2 years old, talking with my grandma, telling her a story that&#39;s really elaborate about werewolves and wolves.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t wait until I grew up. I used to look at my mom&#39;s stockings and put them on with her high heels and mess with my hair.</p><p>My mom grew up in Kansas, my dad in Indiana. They had boring childhoods.</p><p>My mom was a dancer, my dad&#39;s a singer and I&#39;ve always had that kind of music in my life.</p><p>My mom died of cancer when I was really young. I&#39;m not someone who tries to work out their own stuff with a role, but I think that happened despite my best efforts to keep myself separate from it.</p><p>My mom sent me to regular high school because she wanted me to have that experience and not say that I missed out, but I didn&#39;t like it at all. I&#39;m more comfortable in the world that I&#39;m in, I grew up in it so when I get around normal kids in regular high school I don&#39;t know what to do. I feel more secure in an adult environment.</p><p>We&#39;ve got activists all across the country like the members of the Million Mom March organization, some of their leaders are here tonight. We&#39;re phone banking congressional offices and pursuing editorial boards.</p><p>My dad and mom divorced when I was around ten, and I didn&#39;t live with him after that, though he was close by and we saw each other weekly. I wasn&#39;t really aware that he was a writer I didn&#39;t start reading his writing until I was about fifteen. It occurred to me then that my dad was kind of special he&#39;s still one of my favorite writers.</p><p>Sometimes, if you don&#39;t have kids yourself, it&#39;s assumed you won&#39;t understand or know how to play a mom, which is kind of silly if you think about it.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t always a writer. When I went to college and majored in fine arts, I was a painter. Then I was a stay-at-home mom.</p><p>It&#39;s always been a dream of mine to get somewhere and to have my mom and dad with me up there.</p><p>Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life.</p><p>My mom was a Democrat and I was scared to death that she was gonna blow it. First I was going to hell with Monroe, and now to Republican hell with Nixon.</p><p>It&#39;s impossible to put yourself first when you&#39;re a mom.</p><p>My parents were both in show business. My father was an actor, my mom an actress, and both singers, dancers and actors. They met in Los Angeles doing a play together and so I grew up in a show biz family.</p><p>My dad was a good athlete. My mom had longevity. There were some athletic genes that certainly got passed down.</p><p>Usually a family is led through the mom or the dad and their career and for the family to be led by my career, even though God has led it, could be a lot of pressure.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t one to go out and buy a new car and stereo system and expensive clothes. My mom helped keep me grounded.</p><p>My dad&#39;s an architect and my mom owned a French bakery for twelve years.</p><p>Well, I am not really a conventional mom at all. Like, I had my kids really young. I had Danny when I was 18 or 19 and then Liam when I was 23 and Molly, I had when I was a little older.</p><p>As a mom, I understand how important it is to ensure kids start their day right and always make sure my kids have a nutritious breakfast. One in five U.S. children live in homes where food is not always available, which is why I partnered with Kellogg&#39;s on their &#39;Share Your Breakfast&#39; campaign, which provide breakfasts to kids in need.</p><p>My mom thought I might be good for voiceover. She thought I had a cute voice, so maybe I could do a cartoon or something. And while we were looking into that, we also thought I should get into theater acting, so I tried it and the first audition I went on, I booked it. And it kind of just snowballed from there.</p><p>Just recently I was in Target with my mom shopping, and out of the blue, I see this father and his two daughters and he says, &#39;Can they get a picture with you?&#39; And I&#39;m thinking to myself, &#39;Am I the one millionth customer or something?&#39;</p><p>I&#39;ve always been homeschooled, so doing it on set is kind of the same thing. My mom makes it very interactive - we&#39;ll get a book on chocolate and learn how to make it, or she will buy antique items. I love military history, the mechanics and strategy of it.</p><p>I was two years old when my mom put me in mommy and me classes. I always had a lot of energy so it was the perfect fit!</p><p>I&#39;m almost a full-time mom.</p><p>My mom and my dad wanted my brother and I to have a better life, you know, better education, better jobs. It was probably harder, much, much harder, for my parents. When you&#39;re a kid, you can learn a language much more easily I learned English in less than a year.</p><p>It was definitely a part of our life. I mean, my mom had both her brothers and her fiancee in Vietnam at the same time, so it wasn&#39;t just my dad&#39;s story, it was my mom&#39;s story too. And we definitely grew up listening to the stories.</p><p>I&#39;m not a figurehead for anything. I was a single mom with two kids. What else was I going to do? It was either be in a band or be a waitress.</p><p>I told my agents that I didn&#39;t want to go on the audition. But as that was happening I called my mom, who has been watching the show from the beginning, and my mom said, &#39;It&#39;s the coolest show. You have to go.&#39;</p><p>My mom is still yelling at me because she needs more autographed pictures.</p><p>I&#39;m named after a horse. My mom&#39;s best friend had a horse named Brooke, so my dad suggested &#39;Brooklyn&#39; as a more formal version, and it just stuck - and now I live in Brooklyn part-time, so go figure.</p><p>But my mother and father were married when my mom was 20 and my dad was 24.</p><p>You know that I am living proof that the American Dream is real. Growing up, our congressman cut through government bureaucratic red tape to help my mom buy our first house. That&#39;s the kind of congressman I&#39;ll be.</p><p>When I was 11 my friend&#39;s mom made a peanut butter sandwich. I ate the sandwich and was like, &#39;I&#39;m never eating anything else again.&#39; And I still eat peanut butter every day. I would put peanut butter on a steak.</p><p>My mom raised us three boys by herself on welfare. It&#39;s not worse than anybody else&#39;s life.</p><p>Now, if you&#39;re Al Gore, you can afford $10 a pop for squiggly-pig-tailed fluorescent light bulbs. But if you&#39;re mainstream America, two or three kids, mom and dad working outside the home, that&#39;s not a very good deal.</p><p>I still feel like a kid sometimes myself so hard to believe that I&#39;m a mom. Now I&#39;m an adult! It only took 38 years!</p><p>I was really lucky. My gal pal was my mom.</p><p>In third grade, I was taking tap-dance lessons, and about six weeks before the recital I wanted to quit. My mom said, &#39;No, you&#39;re going to stay with it.&#39; Well, I did it, and I was bad, too! But my parents never let their kids walk away from something because it was too hard.</p><p>I love to fly. I always wanted to fly. It&#39;s been one of my dreams since I was 3 years old. I remember saying to my mom, 3 years old, every day, &#39;I can fly!&#39; Living on the ninth floor, it was dangerous.</p><p>In fact, my mom always told me because I was the daughter of an Army officer born overseas in Paris, France, that under the Constitution she believed that I could never run for president.</p><p>They wrapped her up like a baby burrito to show to Mom. Here were a mother and her daughter and I love them both so much. I couldn&#39;t wait for Courtney to come to the hospital so I could have all my women together.</p><p>My mom breastfed me for more than a year, and I can&#39;t imagine doing it any other way. It&#39;s cheap and much better for the environment, and you don&#39;t have to lug all that stuff around.</p><p>I never thought I was a great mom. I always worked. I fell in love with my children as they got older.</p><p>My mom just understands about stuff. We have a really good trust, and she knows I can take care of myself.</p><p>I don&#39;t have to do a lot to my eyebrows. My mom always told me not to pluck them, which is great advice.</p><p>I remember my mom saying that after you have a baby you get really thin. So you gain all that weight and then you just lose it and keep losing it.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m a stay-at-home mom, which I was for the five years before this. She&#39;s absolutely been my focus. That&#39;s the choice I made. Desperate Housewives is perfect for me. I get to go back to work and still be able to take my daughter to school and pick her up.</p><p>If you just stay away from junk, and stick with what your mom taught you, you&#39;re eating pretty healthy.</p><p>I&#39;m from Manchester, Mass., so it was lobster, lobster and more lobster! Also, lots of fish that we caught in the summers, clam chowder and roast beef sandwiches. But my mom was pretty healthy we had a lot of chicken and broccoli and rice as well.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure anyone - and I could be wrong in this - grows up thinking, I want to be a single mom.</p><p>I&#39;m a mom first, a singer second.</p><p>Mom worked with autistic children.</p><p>So much of our lives are defined by habit or what the guy next to us is doing, never wondering and knowing who and what we support with our actions, from the detergent Mom always used, to my favorite dish I make... A lot of my life is unexamined habit.</p><p>My mom was so people-friendly. She was incredible. She&#39;d go to the mall, and she&#39;d talk to everyone. Give people a kiss on the cheek. I think if I wasn&#39;t pushed around a lot, I&#39;d be great with people. Maybe I still can be.</p><p>My mom was Sicilian, my dad was Sicilian. Mom was a great cook, but all the women were.</p><p>I used to do skits for my mom... and I was always entertaining as a kid.</p><p>They see me as being this Super Mom on TV who also can more than handle a difficult husband, and they assume I&#39;m going to be just full of wisdom as a mother and wife myself.</p><p>I took piano for many years. I kicked and screamed through all of my lessons, but my mom really insisted.</p><p>When I was 10 years old my mom used to play Tupac while she cleaned the house.</p><p>My dad died when I was three so my mom had to raise four kids on her own, and I think there&#39;s a part of me that pulls upon having watched my mom do that our whole lives. She had to make it work.</p><p>That&#39;s a big deal for kids, when they come into the kitchen and the teacher is drinking coffee with mom. They react differently on the next day when you say: &#39;Sit down and shut-up!&#39;</p><p>I love my mother Ali so much. I&#39;m a momma&#39;s boy. I just have a very cool mom. It&#39;s not as though I had any say in the matter. I&#39;m just really fortunate. She&#39;s the most kind, loving, giving woman.</p><p>My mom had gotten a Super 8 camera to make home movies with, and my brother and me got our hands on it and ran with it.</p><p>No one was more important than my mom and dad. I know they are watching from a place up in heaven here today to make sure all their kids are doing good.</p><p>I really like Calvin Klein for his classic simplicity. I also think Prabal Gurung designs some great pieces that work well for me. My mom has such great style she&#39;s my biggest influence.</p><p>I never let anyone pluck, including myself, unless my mom approves. She guards my eyebrows. She&#39;s like the eyebrow police!</p><p>My grandmother had six kids - one died as an infant - and she was dirt-poor, and all her kids got an education. And my mom grew up poor. And they both worked so hard and cultivated so much of their own happiness. I wanted to have that like an amulet. Not like armor, but like a magic feather. Like Dumbo&#39;s magic feather.</p><p>I want somebody like my mom. My mom is a very charitable woman. She&#39;s the sweetest woman in the world. I&#39;m looking for the second sweetest woman in the world. I&#39;m looking for honesty and a big heart.</p><p>My mom would have liked it that I patterned myself more after Jimmy Reed.</p><p>My mom and dad - they were always there. They were always on the set. They focused on our family life. The entertainment business wasn&#39;t the end-all. They weren&#39;t out to get the next big paycheck or the next big movie. It was about &#39;What can we do as a family.&#39;</p><p>The military infrastructure grew me. My faith in God is important, my belief in my country is important, my relationship to my family is important, the things that Mom and Dad tell you growing up are important.</p><p>I always think about which blood drive was going on in Georgia that day when that husband or mom or school teacher rolled up their sleeve and actually gave me a second chance at life. It&#39;s the ultimate gift of life, and I&#39;m the one who was on the other end.</p><p>I was a big fan of &#39;The Smurfs&#39; growing up, even though by default - my mom used to force me to watch because she was a &#39;Smurfs&#39; fan.</p><p>My mom was a big &#39;Smurfs&#39; fan, so she would force me to watch every Saturday morning. I had no choice in the matter. I would jump downstairs on Saturday morning, &#39;Hurray, cartoons!&#39; and she would say, &#39;Smurfs! That&#39;s what you&#39;re watching.&#39;</p><p>When I was little, we lived on 8 acres and my mom had a horse. But when I was 7, my mom kicked my dad out, and then in order to feed us five kids, she got critters cheap or for free and raised them for food. We milked a cow, raised chickens, pigs and beef cattle. We heated our one-story house with wood and stayed cold all winter.</p><p>I grew up with the classics. My mom and I would sit and watch &#39;Singin&#39; in the Rain&#39; and &#39;White Christmas&#39; - those kind of movies.</p><p>Two weeks ago at the U.S. Amateur, my mom caddied, and that is kind of a different feeling, because she&#39;s your mom and you have to listen to her. It was really comfortable having my mom there, but it&#39;s also really relieving and comfortable to have someone that knows the course off their hat, really.</p><p>My mom is a very warm, typical sort of Jewish-mother type. And my dad has a somewhat, um, different personality.</p><p>I hope that through my work, artists will take some chances, break some rules, and make art that comes from inside of them. I would like to be remembered as a kind person, a great Mom, and a bit unruly - in a good way!</p><p>I think there&#39;s a time to work, and everyone has to kind of adjust. And then there&#39;s a time to relax, and be the mom or take the kids on vacation when you need to wind down. So it&#39;s a matter of planning, and being able to map out your year or your week or let&#39;s start with the day. It is just being multi-tasking and being available.</p><p>Well, my mom taught public school music for almost 40 years. And she&#39;s about 5 feet - and very mighty. And she would control her kids a lot by giving them the eye, or the stare.</p><p>She had a hit for every syllable: &#39;Don&#39;t. You. Ever. Talk. To. Me. Like. That. Ever. Again.&#39; That was the last time I ever talked back to Mom.</p><p>My mom&#39;s passionate and energetic and very funny and enthusiastic.</p><p>My whole life sort of ended when my mom died.</p><p>I always tell people, I&#39;m a better swimmer because I&#39;m a mom and a better mom because I&#39;m swimmer.</p><p>People close to me called me &#39;Curry in a Hurry.&#39; I was moving through life at 100 miles an hour trying to further my career and be a great mom and make everyone happy.</p><p>I think my first big purchase was actually for my mom. She had one of those &#39;90s TVs in her living room that&#39;s like a 10x10 brick, so I purchased her a flatscreen for her living room.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what I want to do when I grow up, or if I&#39;m sure I ever want to grow up. I&#39;m sure there are people that wish I would, but you know, my mom will get over it.</p><p>My mom had to beg the guys to let me play. I couldn&#39;t even play the drums right - Brian had to show me.</p><p>It&#39;s quite hard to have your mom as a teacher - it&#39;s like, she&#39;s not necessarily a &#39;real teacher&#39; for me. But she&#39;d always teach me to really hear the music, and develop my ear, and to try and hear the harmonics of the piano.</p><p>My mom&#39;s a concert pianist, so she started teaching me when I was around seven. When I was eight, I started writing my own songs, and kinda started putting piano and singing together. But I&#39;m trained classically, which is a big influence on me, I think.</p><p>We&#39;re definitely a hodgepodge of influences. Mine, most heavily, would be Southern rock - the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and stuff like that. Hillary is more from the country side - her mom is Linda Davis, a country singer. Dave, he&#39;s a big fan of the Eagles and like that.</p><p>My mom was the picture of the blue-collar mom: Two and three and four jobs to make sure that me and my sister never needed, that was her thing.</p><p>For the first few years of my life my mom used to cut my hair so there were a lot of bowl-cut hair styles.</p><p>I probably wouldn&#39;t be singing if not for Michael Jackson. When I started singing, I didn&#39;t like my tone until my mom put me on to Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, so listening to the way they used their instrument helped me get more comfortable with my own.</p><p>I was serious about ballet for a long time, but my mom got me into tap and jazz and modern and hip-hop, and I was one of those over-lessoned children.</p><p>My earliest acting memory is making up a play for my mom and dad called The Lonesome Baby. I have no idea what The Lonesome Baby was about. I just remember the title. But I&#39;m sure it was an epic.</p><p>I think if I could be any superhero, it&#39;d probably be my mom... but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d look too good in high heels, so it&#39;s not gonna happen.</p><p>I am very proud of my mom and consider her the most courageous woman I know. With perseverance, sacrifice and hard work, she raised a family of Olympic athletes and gave us the tools and the spirit to succeed. That is something that my brothers and I will always be thankful for.</p><p>My mom&#39;s collard greens. No one else in the world can make them like hers. I&#39;m not just saying that because she&#39;s my mom. She&#39;s got some Mississippi secret. I could seriously eat them every day.</p><p>It&#39;s the best thing ever - I love being a mom. This is my only child. My career was a priority earlier in my life, but now my son is definitely the priority.</p><p>I love every second of being a mom.</p><p>When I can 10 or 11, my mom was the one out there catching passes for me. She was my prime receiver.</p><p>My mom was very strict when I was growing up. I could not talk to boys until I was 18. I had to study and work hard.</p><p>I&#39;m not a businessperson. I have no sense of money. My mom does everything for me. She makes all my decisions for me, and even buys my clothes. She&#39;s very protective.</p><p>I&#39;m a mom, a full-time mom when I&#39;m not taping. I do the carpool thing, and bake the cookies, and do the homework.</p><p>It would be great to do another television show that was a multi-camera because the hours are so wonderful and you can be a good mom at the same time. The problem is, there aren&#39;t a lot of multi-camera shows that I personally like. My aesthetic is more geared toward single-camera shows.</p><p>My mom, Emilie, always taught me to think hard about marriage.</p><p>My mom was a photographer and whenever they needed a baby for a modelling job, she&#39;d stick me in front of the camera. That&#39;s how it started.</p><p>I love Westerns and I remember as a kid climbing up on the couch and make it into a saddle and shoot guns and fall off. I would lay there after my death and my mom would tell me to eat lunch and I&#39;d say, &#39;I&#39;m still dead, Mom!&#39; I was Method, even then.</p><p>When I was a child it was very clear what I was allowed to see and what I was not allowed to see and there was no discussion or option or negotiation. Whatever my mom said, that&#39;s what went down.</p><p>My mom put me in dance classes when I was 5 years old.</p><p>When I see my mom in the stands, it always pushes me to succeed.</p><p>I think it would be a lot easier if I said, &#39;I feel like a dude,&#39; but I was raised by a southern mom, so I know how to put on lipstick and walk in heels and rock that look. It&#39;s exactly that juxtaposition that confuses people.</p><p>My mom and dad are both in stand-up comedy, so that&#39;s where I started, that&#39;s where I got everything. My roots are holding the mic.</p><p>My mom is two people to me. She&#39;s my mom number one, and then she&#39;s this lady most comedians know as being a legendary owner of a nightclub that&#39;s responsible for starting a lot of heavy careers.</p><p>When I was six years old my friend was auditioning for &#39;Annie,&#39; and I decided I wanted to audition with her. My mom was worried I would fall flat on my face because I&#39;d never opened my mouth to sing, so she sent me to vocal lessons. I did the audition and fell in love with the entire process of a show.</p><p>I think of myself as a fairly attractive girl and always have, thanks to my mom. I was brought into this world thinking I was gorgeous because my mother was extremely devoted to this notion.</p><p>I remember my mom had a big collection of copies of Saturday Evening Post magazines, and that was really my introduction to those great illustrators.</p><p>I know this is kind of corny, but we thought about renewing our vows again because I think my mom would really love it if we did that in Arkansas, where I came from.</p><p>I&#39;ve been an atheist since I was nine years old. And my mom is really religious, so we have a strange relationship. But if my mother was right, what would be the reason that the gods could let anything bad happen in the world?</p><p>My mom and I have always had issues.</p><p>I&#39;m a mom first.</p><p>I&#39;m not blaming my mom for my life because I am responsible for me, and nobody can change me or ruin me easier than I can.</p><p>My dad is a lawyer and my mom is an artist. So growing up was exactly what it sounds like - strict household but a lot of creativity. They are so psyched that I get to make music for a living. My parents rule.</p><p>Well I was eight years old, and I have an older cousin who is three years older than me and she was doing acting, commercials, and modeling at the time and... to see my cousin doing that was really inspiring and I wanted to do it. So I went to my mom and I asked her if I could do it, and for the acting part of it, she made me study for a year.</p><p>I&#39;m a just a mom when I walk down the street.</p><p>Naturally, people are curious about how my real mom feels about me having a TV mom.</p><p>I just started watching wrestling in 2008, and I&#39;ve loved it ever since. I told my mom I wanted to become a wrestler.</p><p>My mom taught me how to make grilled chicken, and I bake, too.</p><p>For as long as I&#39;ve been acting, I have been very lucky to be paired with really great actresses playing my mom.</p><p>When I was going on auditions, it was nerve-racking. I&#39;d always say to my mom that it would be awesome if I could get a series. When Modern Family came along, I said, &#39;You know what, Mom? I believe I&#39;m going to get this role.&#39;</p><p>For some students, school is the only place where they get a hot meal and a warm hug. Teachers are sometimes the only ones who tell our children they can go from an Indian reservation to the Ivy League, from the home of a struggling single mom to the White House.</p><p>I always had an interest in fashion because my mom is a celebrity fashion stylist. I grew up being on set or in showrooms.</p><p>My mom always taught me to be sweet and polite and cross my legs because it&#39;s what the guys like. Actually, they like a raunchy girl once in a while.</p><p>My original inspiration was my mom: a few years after the death of my dad, she started dating one my teachers!</p><p>If I go on dates, my mom is always with me. She&#39;s always there making sure I&#39;m all right. Like if I go to see a movie with a boy, she&#39;ll go to dinner next door.</p><p>An agent saw one of the plays I did at ACT, but my mom was like, No, she&#39;s too young. I became so annoying that a year and a half later she just couldn&#39;t stand hearing me any more!</p><p>Cancer has been unfortunately in my life. My mom&#39;s best friend is kicking ass in her battle with breast cancer. Both of my grandmas had cancer. I recently lost a friend to cancer.</p><p>I spend so much time with my parents. My mom and I were joined at the hip for five years. There was not one moment when I wasn&#39;t with her.</p><p>My mom still lives in Denver and some of my brothers are still in the area, so I still have strong ties there.</p><p>When I&#39;m in the gym, I&#39;m in the gym, and that is my focus. But when I&#39;m not in the gym, I&#39;m enjoying being a mom and taking care of those responsibilities .. They really do provide me with the balance that I need to be a more complete athlete.</p><p>I&#39;m looking forward to being a mom and a wife and a business owner.</p><p>I&#39;ve been a pretty selfish mom and a very unselfish athlete for about three years now and it&#39;s time to put my family first. It&#39;s probably time to move on.</p><p>My first big job was an Abercrombie &amp;ampFitch campaign. But my mom wouldn&#39;t let me skip school for it, so I missed half of the shoot. When we got there, we realized Bruce Weber was the photographer we knew we had made a mistake!</p><p>My mom and my stepdad are both therapists.</p><p>My mom is a constant in my life in so many ways.</p><p>My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 13 and it was something we weren&#39;t really aware of as a family.</p><p>My mom told me to do whatever I wanted to do and don&#39;t get too anxious about it.</p><p>Sometimes when my mom finds a fun article and really wants me to read it, I will. But I prefer to just kind of focus on what I want to do and not really what other people are saying, because I don&#39;t want that to affect me too much.</p><p>My mom and dad put my brother and sister through university and they were very keen for us to have an academic background just to give us a chance.</p><p>I had really great parents who always gave me lots of opportunity for choice, but I didn&#39;t always realize how rare that was for a girl for them to say, &#39;You can be a mom or have a career or do both or do something we haven&#39;t thought of yet.&#39;</p><p>You eat and sleep it all day long and play on the streets until mom calls you in. My story is no different than anybody else&#39;s.</p><p>When you become a mom you just learn how to function sleep deprived and you do get used to it. I came back to work when Finley was three months old and the first few months were rough. Then somehow you learn to exist on no sleep and now when he does upon occasion sleep through the night, which is like a full six hours, you&#39;re pretty sure he&#39;s suffocating. So you don&#39;t sleep anyway.</p><p>I think there&#39;s a danger of a being typecast as the all-American mom forever.</p><p>My Mom is a ballet director, so I had this idea in me that classical training is the best foundation for anything you do, so I wanted to get a classical background and voice.</p><p>Everyone in my family is an artist. Both my parents are painters and my mom&#39;s an opera singer. I was never shown any other way to process life.</p><p>Losing my mom at such a young age had a profound effect on my life.</p><p>I think I&#39;m going to spend some time learning how to be a first-time mom, and then I&#39;ll go back to work.</p><p>My dad was Jewish. My mom is not. So I was not raised anything.</p><p>Growing up I always shopped at Victoria&#39;s Secret with my mom and saw Angels like Gisele and Karolina Kurkova in the windows.</p><p>When I was young, I had two older sisters, and since I was the youngest in my family, my mom took me around with her all the time. I was forever with her when she was having coffee in the middle of the afternoon with her three sisters. And they would talk about men. I absorbed a lot of that.</p><p>My earliest memory is seeing Michael Jackson in Melbourne with my sister when I was about ten. I still have this souvenir stick with a glove that would light up and make a peace sign in a bunch of different colors. I&#39;m so happy my mom didn&#39;t throw that out.</p><p>I was born to a Nigerian dad and a Kenyan mom, and coming to the States was really academic.</p><p>Oh, my mom. She&#39;s one of my biggest fans.</p><p>They very seldom let me lose my cool. They made me like I was Polly Perfect, which was ridiculous so that when I bump into kids on the street they&#39;d say &#39;I wish my Mom were like you.&#39;</p><p>I usually travel with a lot of people, like my dad, mom and sisters.</p><p>I&#39;m a &#39;70s mom, and my daughter is a &#39;90s mom. I know a lot of women my age who are real computer freaks.</p><p>My mom was a professional fitness competitor, so I go into the gym with her. I train with my dad and mother. It&#39;s embarrassing, because she&#39;s really strong.</p><p>Part of the reason that I moved to Los Angeles is that even though my mom introduced me to all kinds of music, I really wanted to work on having my own identify, on being who I am and doing what I do, and seeing how people responded.</p><p>I&#39;m extremely blessed to have the extraordinary mother that I have, and I don&#39;t mean Diana Ross, I mean the mother. My mom paved a road that didn&#39;t exist, as did Oprah.</p><p>My mom taught me to go after my dreams. I have this faith in myself that I must have gotten from her.</p><p>Because of my unique experience as my mom&#39;s child, the beginning of my journey was more about me trying to figure out who I was on my own. My mom is one of the greatest moms and so supportive of all my siblings and of all of us being who we are, and not who she wanted us to be.</p><p>I&#39;ve been acting my whole life. I have this huge imagination! I&#39;m a dancer and my mom&#39;s a dance teacher, and I was always performing and entertaining people. I&#39;d go to see live theatre or a movie, and I&#39;d become the main character for a few days afterwards. I loved being somebody new for a temporary amount of time.</p><p>So, from a very young age, my mom tells me that I wanted to be Michael J. Fox. I didn&#39;t want to be an actor. I just wanted to be Michael J. Fox for awhile. And then, I realized that he was an actor, so I pursued that.</p><p>When I was seven, I asked my mom if I could be on TV, and she said if I really wanted to, I could. I got an agent and booked my first audition.</p><p>My mom came from such humble beginnings and especially my dad as well. He didn&#39;t go to university.</p><p>My mom moved up between Leland and Greenville when I was just a little tot.</p><p>Well, Mom and Dad are both actors, and I&#39;ve spent a lot of time watching my mom on stage and a lot of time on set with my dad, so it was very much a part of my growing up.</p><p>I always was drawn to the performing arts. I started dancing when I was two. I sang, loved to act, and loved going to visit my mom on-set. But she wanted me to have a normal childhood, so I wasn&#39;t really allowed to pursue acting till I got older.</p><p>My mom is a really good cook. I didn&#39;t get the cooking gene, but she cooks this really amazing dinner every Christmas, and that&#39;s always really fun.</p><p>Last time I spoke to my mom she called me from a pay phone, and we didn&#39;t have the best talk. Ever since my stepdad passed away three years ago, she has been very depressed and hasn&#39;t been herself at all.</p><p>I love getting my nails done. My mom&#39;s best friend is a manicurist. When I was little, she&#39;d do little paintings on my nails, like flowers.</p><p>We&#39;ve always loved going to the movies. Our mom and dad are big movie fans. They&#39;d take us on these movie orgys where we&#39;d see sometimes three movies in a day.</p><p>I&#39;ve been drawing my whole life. My mom says my sister and I were drawing by age 1. Animation seems a real, natural extension of drawing as a way of telling a story visually.</p><p>Anyone who knows me knows my mom, Dorcina, has to sign off on any decision and that she will play a major part in any decision.</p><p>My mom introduced me to science-fiction.</p><p>Then you&#39;ve got Georgetown, and I really just like everything about them. When I went down there with my mom, it really opened my eyes to what they were all about. I have to factor in what a school like that can do for me, even away from being a basketball player.</p><p>I love what I do and I think it shows. As my kids get older, they can see me as a mom who loves working.</p><p>I was fortunate enough to have my kids early, so being a mom always ended up being a better gig than these other parts that came along. So I always justified not really working a lot because I had a family.</p><p>On my mom&#39;s side I&#39;m Mexican, and my dad is a white dude.</p><p>When you have lost people like I lost my birth mom at a young age and you remember the whole process of losing her, you want to grab on to something that makes you whole.</p><p>I was born to a single mom and raised by her and my grandparents.</p><p>At first I could not believe what I was reading. I got up from my seat and walked away, talking to myself that I may have found my mom.</p><p>Our songs touch people, and take them back to a time when there was no threat of terrorism, when you didn&#39;t have to lock your doors and when Mom and Dad took care of everything.</p><p>Whether it&#39;s a 16-year old girl, or a mom, or a guy, or anybody, as long as they come up and they&#39;re excited to meet me &#39;cause they&#39;ve had some sort of relationship with something I&#39;ve created, it&#39;s the coolest thing ever. It never gets old. It&#39;s awesome.</p><p>My mom is in the navy and my dad works for the army, but I never called them &#39;sir&#39; or &#39;ma&#39;am&#39; or anything like that, and we never really moved around a lot because both my parents were stationed in D.C.</p><p>When I was young I thought that money was the most important thing in life now that I am old I know that it is.</p><p>A little thought and a little kindness are often worth more than a great deal of money.</p><p>Money has never made man happy, nor will it, there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness.

It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver.</p><p>It&#39;s a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.</p><p>So you think that money is the root of all evil.

I&#39;m a single man. I like spending my money.</p><p>Money does not guarantee success.</p><p>Kids are meant to believe that their stepping stone to massive money is &#39;The X Factor.&#39;</p><p>The way the bankers have kind of toppled the way money is distributed, and taken most of it into their own hands, is as good as Stalin or Hitler.</p><p>I saw Deep Purple live once and I paid money for it and I thought, &#39;Geez, this is ridiculous.&#39; You just see through all that sort of stuff. I never liked those Deep Purples or those sort of things. I always hated it.

That is what being in the United Kingdom is all about.</p><p>Nothing except the mint can make money without advertising.</p><p>Because I don&#39;t take money, I&#39;ll go anywhere and do a benefit concert with almost any orchestra.</p><p>Kids are meant to believe that their stepping stone to massive money is &#39;The X Factor.&#39; Luck is great, but most of life is hard work.

The fellow that has nothing but money is poorer still.</p><p>People look at me, and they go, &#39;You&#39;re white, you&#39;re smart, you must have went to college. You must have grown up with money.&#39;</p><p>Old friends pass away, new friends appear. It is just like the days. An old day passes, a new day arrives. The important thing is to make it meaningful: a meaningful friend - or a meaningful day.</p><p>When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.</p><p>Prayer is the key of the morning and the bolt of the evening.</p><p>If it&#39;s your job to eat a frog, it&#39;s best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it&#39;s your job to eat two frogs, it&#39;s best to eat the biggest one first.</p><p>Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it.</p><p>I wake up every morning at nine and grab for the morning paper. Then I look at the obituary page. If my name is not on it, I get up.</p><p>Love. Fall in love and stay in love. Write only what you love, and love what you write. The key word is love. You have to get up in the morning and write something you love, something to live for.</p><p>The sun is new each day.</p><p>Thank God every morning when you get up that you have something to do that day, which must be done, whether you like it or not.</p><p>An early-morning walk is a blessing for the whole day.</p><p>In the morning a man walks with his whole body in the evening, only with his legs.</p><p>Commitment is a big part of what I am and what I believe. How committed are you to winning? How committed are you to being a good friend? To being trustworthy? To being successful? How committed are you to being a good father, a good teammate, a good role model? There&#39;s that moment every morning when you look in the mirror: Are you committed, or are you not?</p><p>I feel sorry for people who don&#39;t drink. They wake up in the morning and that&#39;s the best they&#39;re going to feel all day.</p><p>Each day is a little life: every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.</p><p>Think in the morning. Act in the noon. Eat in the evening. Sleep in the night.</p><p>Be pleasant until ten o&#39;clock in the morning and the rest of the day will take care of itself.</p><p>The man with the best job in the country is the vice-president. All he has to do is get up every morning and say, &#39;How is the president?&#39;</p><p>I think that when you get dressed in the morning, sometimes you&#39;re really making a decision about your behavior for the day. Like if you put on flipflops, you&#39;re saying: &#39;Hope I don&#39;t get chased today.&#39; &#39;Be nice to people in sneakers.&#39;</p><p>Everyone has highs and lows that they have to learn from, but every morning I start off with a good head on my shoulders, saying to myself, &#39;It&#39;s going to be a good day!&#39;.</p><p>I miss Saturday morning, rolling out of bed, not shaving, getting into my car with my girls, driving to the supermarket, squeezing the fruit, getting my car washed, taking walks.</p><p>Do not say, &#39;It is morning,&#39; and dismiss it with a name of yesterday. See it for the first time as a newborn child that has no name.</p><p>I have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day, a fresh try, one more start, with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning.</p><p>This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the fruit-of-the-loom guys laughing at me.</p><p>If you&#39;re bored with life - you don&#39;t get up every morning with a burning desire to do things - you don&#39;t have enough goals.</p><p>When I woke up this morning my girlfriend asked me, &#39;Did you sleep good?&#39; I said &#39;No, I made a few mistakes.&#39;</p><p>He, who every morning plans the transactions of the day, and follows that plan, carries a thread that will guide him through a labyrinth of the most busy life.</p><p>I wake up some mornings and sit and have my coffee and look out at my beautiful garden, and I go, &#39;Remember how good this is. Because you can lose it.&#39;</p><p>Nothing is more beautiful than the loveliness of the woods before sunrise.</p><p>Each morning when I awake, I experience again a supreme pleasure - that of being Salvador Dali.</p><p>Opportunities are like sunrises. If you wait too long, you miss them.</p><p>In a real dark night of the soul, it is always three o&#39;clock in the morning, day after day.</p><p>Arranging a bowl of flowers in the morning can give a sense of quiet in a crowded day - like writing a poem or saying a prayer.</p><p>It ain&#39;t as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.</p><p>Each morning sees some task begun, each evening sees it close Something attempted, something done, has earned a night&#39;s repose.</p><p>First thing every morning before you arise say out loud, &#39;I believe,&#39; three times.</p><p>Every morning I get up and look through the Forbes list of the richest people in America. If I&#39;m not there, I go to work.</p><p>Some mornings, it&#39;s just not worth chewing through the leather straps.</p><p>Manners is the key thing. Say, for instance, when you&#39;re growing up, you&#39;re walking down the street, you&#39;ve got to tell everybody good morning. Everybody. You can&#39;t pass one person.</p><p>A good idea will keep you awake during the morning, but a great idea will keep you awake during the night.</p><p>Early morning cheerfulness can be extremely obnoxious.</p><p>The problem with marriage is that it ends every night after making love, and it must be rebuilt every morning before breakfast.</p><p>I&#39;m always thinking about creating. My future starts when I wake up every morning... Every day I find something creative to do with my life.</p><p>It&#39;s always such a joy that you wake up in the morning and there&#39;s work to do.</p><p>I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I&#39;m going to learn, I must do it by listening.</p><p>Good morning is a contradiction of terms.</p><p>I had a monumental idea this morning, but I didn&#39;t like it.</p><p>I love the smell of juice boxes in the morning.</p><p>I never really look for anything. What God throws my way comes.

Nothing in the paper today, we sigh.</p><p>Morning comes whether you set the alarm or not.</p><p>Never face facts if you do you&#39;ll never get up in the morning.</p><p>Tell him he can have my title, but I want it back in the morning.</p><p>We could hardly wait to get up in the morning.</p><p>It was a splendid summer morning and it seemed as if nothing could go wrong.</p><p>I feel sorry for people who don&#39;t drink.

I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night.

This makes it hard to plan the day.</p><p>In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.</p><p>When you rise in the morning, give thanks for the light, for your life, for your strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason to give thanks, the fault lies in yourself.</p><p>The brain is a wonderful organ it starts working the moment you get up in the morning and does not stop until you get into the office.</p><p>Probably the happiest period in life most frequently is in middle age, when the eager passions of youth are cooled, and the infirmities of age not yet begun as we see that the shadows, which are at morning and evening so large, almost entirely disappear at midday.</p><p>True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country.</p><p>I have to be alone very often. I&#39;d be quite happy if I spent from Saturday night until Monday morning alone in my apartment.

A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do.</p><p>Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies.</p><p>I look upon death to be as necessary to our constitution as sleep. We shall rise refreshed in the morning.</p><p>After all those years as a woman hearing &#39;not thin enough, not pretty enough, not smart enough, not this enough, not that enough,&#39; almost overnight I woke up one morning and thought, &#39;I&#39;m enough.&#39;</p><p>There&#39;s nothing sadder in this world than to awake Christmas morning and not be a child.</p><p>A good husband is never the first to go to sleep at night or the last to awake in the morning.</p><p>All men are children, and of one family. The same tale sends them all to bed, and wakes them in the morning.</p><p>I&#39;ve been saying for a couple of years now that people need to let God out of the Sunday morning box, that He doesn&#39;t want to just be with you for an hour or two on Sunday morning and then put back in His box to sit there until you have an emergency, but He wants to invade your Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.</p><p>It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.</p><p>The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.</p><p>One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I&#39;ll never know.</p><p>I recently took up ice sculpting. Last night I made an ice cube. This morning I made 12, I was prolific.</p><p>Every morning I jump out of bed and step on a landmine. The landmine is me. After the explosion, I spent the rest of the day putting the pieces together.</p><p>I have a great deal of company in the house, especially in the morning when nobody calls.</p><p>In my afternoon walk I would fain forget all my morning occupations and my obligations to society.</p><p>And this President wakes up every morning, looks out across America and is proud to announce, &#39;It could be worse.&#39; It could be worse? Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse? Of course not. What defines us as Americans is our unwavering conviction that we know it must be better.</p><p>Just in terms of allocation of time resources, religion is not very efficient. There&#39;s a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.</p><p>A leaf fluttered in through the window this morning, as if supported by the rays of the sun, a bird settled on the fire escape, joy in the task of coffee, joy accompanied me as I walked.</p><p>I love that feeling of being in love, the effect of having butterflies when you wake up in the morning. That is special.</p><p>The person who doesn&#39;t scatter the morning dew will not comb gray hairs.</p><p>Burning desire to be or do something gives us staying power - a reason to get up every morning or to pick ourselves up and start in again after a disappointment.</p><p>To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn&#39;t be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.</p><p>I have retired, but if there&#39;s anything that would kill me it is to wake up in the morning not knowing what to do.</p><p>Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That&#39;s how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose.</p><p>I woke up one morning thinking about wolves and realized that wolf packs function as families. Everyone has a role, and if you act within the parameters of your role, the whole pack succeeds, and when that falls apart, so does the pack.</p><p>There&#39;s pros and cons of a big church. Cons is I don&#39;t get to know everybody, I don&#39;t get to go to their ballgame, I don&#39;t get to marry everybody, but the pros are you get all this community, 800 ushers come in to serve, getting there at 7 in the morning on their day off and coming in on Saturday to make all those wafers.</p><p>Morning without you is a dwindled dawn.</p><p>We sleep, but the loom of life never stops, and the pattern which was weaving when the sun went down is weaving when it comes up in the morning.</p><p>My mother had morning sickness after I was born.</p><p>If one morning I walked on top of the water across the Potomac River, the headline that afternoon would read: &#39;President Can&#39;t Swim.&#39;</p><p>I slept with faith and found a corpse in my arms on awakening I drank and danced all night with doubt and found her a virgin in the morning.</p><p>It was one of those evenings when men feel that truth, goodness and beauty are one. In the morning, when they commit their discovery to paper, when others read it written there, it looks wholly ridiculous.</p><p>I think about baseball when I wake up in the morning. I think about it all day and I dream about it at night. The only time I don&#39;t think about it is when I&#39;m playing it.</p><p>I think it&#39;s been hard for people to understand how Islam can be a good religion, and yet the Islamists are evil. Those of us who have had experience with Islam understand this, just as we understand the difference between snake handlers and people going to church on Sunday morning.</p><p>Nature gives to every time and season some beauties of its own and from morning to night, as from the cradle to the grave, it is but a succession of changes so gentle and easy that we can scarcely mark their progress.</p><p>The great fun in my life has been getting up every morning and rushing to the typewriter because some new idea has hit me.</p><p>When traveling with someone, take large does of patience and tolerance with your morning coffee.</p><p>Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended.</p><p>I would like to find a stew that will give me heartburn immediately, instead of at three o clock in the morning.</p><p>That&#39;s the trouble with being me. At this point, nobody gives a damn what my problem is. I could literally have a tumor on the side of my head and they&#39;d be like, &#39;Yeah, big deal. I&#39;d eat a tumor every morning for the kinda money you&#39;re pulling down.&#39;</p><p>In these times you have to be an optimist to open your eyes when you awake in the morning.</p><p>Hope is the greatest thing for moms of autism.

I&#39;m on a mission to tell parents that there is a way.</p><p>I like to use &#39;I Can&#39;t Believe it&#39;s Not Butter&#39; on my toast in the morning, because sometimes when I eat breakfast, I like to be incredulous.

It defines you. Forget about vacations, about going home at 6 pm - last thing at night you&#39;ll send emails, first thing in the morning you&#39;ll read emails, and you&#39;ll wake up in the middle of the night. But it&#39;s hugely rewarding as you&#39;re fulfilling something for yourself.</p><p>The thing I love most about going on vacation is that I get to leave behind any kind of schedule. My entire life is scheduled from morning to night, and when I&#39;m on vacation, there is no schedule.</p><p>I never married because there was no need. I have three pets at home which answer the same purpose as a husband. I have a dog which growls every morning, a parrot which swears all afternoon, and a cat that comes home late at night.</p><p>When I woke up Sunday morning at the Open and stepped outside and felt the wind and rain in my face, I knew I had an excellent chance to win if I just took my time and trusted myself.</p><p>On Sunday morning, I&#39;m not nervous... I can&#39;t wait to tell what God wants me to say.</p><p>It seems to me that trying to live without friends is like milking a bear to get cream for your morning coffee. It is a whole lot of trouble, and then not worth much after you get it.</p><p>The happiest part of a man&#39;s life is what he passes lying awake in bed in the morning.</p><p>The bed is a bundle of paradoxes: we go to it with reluctance, yet we quit it with regret we make up our minds every night to leave it early, but we make up our bodies every morning to keep it late.</p><p>I protest that if some great Power would agree to make me always think what is true and do what is right, on condition of being turned into a sort of clock and would up every morning before I got out of bed, I should instantly close with the offer.</p><p>It is a matter of shame that in the morning the birds should be awake earlier than you.</p><p>It is a good morning exercise for a research scientist to discard a pet hypothesis every day before breakfast. It keeps him young.</p><p>There is only one thing that a man really wants to do, all his life and that is, to find his way to his God, his Morning Star, salute his fellow man, and enjoy the woman who has come the long way with him.</p><p>And I know this happens because I took economics, and I&#39;d explain it to ya, but I flunked that course. Not my fault. They taught it at 8 o&#39;clock in the morning. And there is absolutely nothing you can learn out of one bloodshot eye.</p><p>Then there is a still higher type of courage - the courage to brave pain, to live with it, to never let others know of it and to still find joy in life to wake up in the morning with an enthusiasm for the day ahead.</p><p>Make sure you never, never argue at night. You just lose a good night&#39;s sleep, and you can&#39;t settle anything until morning anyway.</p><p>I have so many things to work on, and so many ways that I fail. But that&#39;s what grace is all about. and I constantly wake up every morning trying to get better, trying to improve, trying to walk closer to God.</p><p>My children are the reason I laugh, smile and want to get up every morning.</p><p>What is love? It is the morning and the evening star.</p><p>On a day when you&#39;re tired, it&#39;s important to just say good morning to everyone so they&#39;re kind of aware that it&#39;s gonna be a good day. Jamie Lee Curtis told me that.</p><p>On that Sunday morning the first thing that impressed the people who approached the tomb was the unusual position of the one and a half to two ton stone that had been lodged in front of the doorway.</p><p>A bachelor is a man who comes to work each morning from a different direction.</p><p>Like a morning dream, life becomes more and more bright the longer we live, and the reason of everything appears more clear. What has puzzled us before seems less mysterious, and the crooked paths look straighter as we approach the end.</p><p>Every year, August lashes out in volcanic fury, rising with the din of morning traffic, its great metallic wings smashing against the ground, heating the air with ever-increasing intensity.</p><p>I am so blessed. I&#39;ve been way over-blessed. At 64 years old, I look forward to going to bed every night so I can wake up in the morning and see what blessing is going to come my way that day. Because you never, ever know what God&#39;s got in store for you.</p><p>Above all, this country is our own. Nobody has to get up in the morning and worry what his neighbors think of him. Being a Jew is no problem here.</p><p>I always do an all-night horror marathon on Saturdays where we start at seven and go until five in the morning.</p><p>Art is why I get up in the morning but my definition ends there. You know I don&#39;t think its fair that I&#39;m living for something I can&#39;t even define.</p><p>Your body tells you what it needs, and if you sleep past your alarm on a Saturday morning, it&#39;s probably because you need the sleep.</p><p>You wake up in the morning and you look at your old spoon, and you say to yourself, &#39;Mick, it&#39;s time to get yourself a new spoon.&#39; And you do.</p><p>I, of course, meditate for two hours every morning. It&#39;s part of my schedule I wake up at 4 a.m. every day and I love it.</p><p>I spend my happiest hours in reading Vedantic books. They are to me like the light of the morning, like the pure air of the mountains - so simple, so true, if once understood.</p><p>I love being. There&#39;s so much wisdom in it. You wake up in the morning and you think, Hey, isn&#39;t it great just being?</p><p>I never knew a man come to greatness or eminence who lay abed late in the morning.</p><p>Cinema in India is like brushing your teeth in the morning. You can&#39;t escape it.</p><p>The great secret of doctors, known only to their wives, but still hidden from the public, is that most things get better by themselves most things, in fact, are better in the morning.</p><p>What inspires you, what excites you when you wake up in the morning?</p><p>Smile in the mirror. Do that every morning and you&#39;ll start to see a big difference in your life.</p><p>I&#39;m going to marry a Jewish woman because I like the idea of getting up Sunday morning and going to the deli.</p><p>And if small businesspeople say they made it on their own, all they are saying is that nobody else worked seven days a week in their place. Nobody showed up in their place to open the door at five in the morning. Nobody did their thinking, and worrying, and sweating for them.</p><p>Driving a motorcycle is like flying. All your senses are alive. When I ride through Beverly Hills in the early morning, and all the sprinklers have turned off, the scents that wash over me are just heavenly. Being House is like flying, too. You&#39;re free of the gravity of what people think.</p><p>The two most joyous times of the year are Christmas morning and the end of school.</p><p>A play is much easier to maintain your personal life with because if you&#39;re rehearsing, you&#39;re working like from 11 to 6 or 11 to 5 and you get to have your whole morning and your whole evening. When you&#39;re doing the play, you have all day.</p><p>There was a chance for me to write one song for the section where Elvis sat in his black leather outfit and sang the old hits.

I can also see the corner where I saw the first tower fall and howled out loud. Seeing the buildings again here is uplifting, healing.;Jerry Saltz;morning 48306;Experience has taught me, when I am shaving of a morning, to keep watch over my thoughts, because, if a line of poetry strays into my memory, my skin bristles so that the razor ceases to act.;A.

It was a new life.;Paul Ryan;morning 48313;I think the worst and most insidious procrastination for me is research.

I don&#39;t want to be caught, like, being like the pig that I was at two in the morning.;Drew Barrymore;morning 48318;To simply wake up every morning a better person than when I went to bed.;Sidney Poitier;morning 48319;The less I behave like Whistler&#39;s mother the night before, the more I look like her the morning after.;Tallulah Bankhead;morning 48320;I don&#39;t have to wait until the next morning to regret something I did that was kinda dumb.;Bobby Knight;morning 48321;I&#39;ve just finished my 20th book this past year and I&#39;m working on my 21st book about the Middle East right now that I&#39;ll finish this year. And I get up early in the morning and when I get tired of the computer and tired of doing research, I walk 20 steps out to my woodshop and I either build furniture or paint paintings. I&#39;m an artist too.;Jimmy Carter;morning 48322;Fashion should be something that in the morning, when you open your window, you say, &#39;Oh fantastic, sun!&#39; Then you take your shower, you say, &#39;OK fantastic, which colour I wear today because I feel happy?&#39; This should be fashion.;Roberto Cavalli;morning 48323;Every night when I go to bed, I hope that I may never wake again, and every morning renews my grief.;Franz Schubert;morning 48324;I&#39;m very happy with the way I look. I wake up some morning, catch myself in the bathroom mirror, and go, &#39;hey girl, you&#39;re alright&#39;. But on the other hand, I find the website stuff, and the polls, something completely removed from my own personal life. You can&#39;t take anything like that too seriously, otherwise you&#39;d end up in the loony bin.;Cameron Diaz;morning 48325;One morning, just like 9/11, there&#39;s going to be a disaster.

That gives people a pep in their step on Monday morning when they go back to work.;Drew Brees;morning 48330;Autumn arrives in early morning, but spring at the close of a winter day.;Elizabeth Bowen;morning 48331;I&#39;m a very early riser, and I don&#39;t like to miss that beautiful early morning light.;David Hockney;morning 48332;I draw flowers every day and send them to my friends so they get fresh blooms every morning.;David Hockney;morning 48333;In the morning, I practice 15 minutes of yoga.;Vivienne Westwood;morning 48334;There are pros and cons of experience. A con is that you can&#39;t look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes and as objectively as if you were a new CEO. Fire yourself on a Friday night and come in on Monday morning as if a search firm put you there as a turn-around leader. Can you be objective and make the bold change?;Andrea Jung;morning 48335;Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen.;Madeleine Albright;morning 48336;You know, I looked at my face in the mirror this morning, and I like being old. My face has more content and when I train in the gym now, I am not training to be strong or handsome - just better than I was yesterday. These days the race is just against myself.;Jean Claude Van Damme;morning 48337;Every morning I wake up and thank God.;Aaron Neville;morning 48338;I usually decide what to wear in the morning, but sometimes, I&#39;ll have a favorite coat or sweater or shoes, and I&#39;ll wear them everyday for a week!;Cameron Russell;morning 48339;Making love in the morning got me through morning sickness. I found I could be happy and throw up at the same time.;Pamela Anderson;morning 48340;I&#39;m not an employee who goes to the office every morning at the same time. Then, vacations are needed.;Karl Lagerfeld;morning 48341;I saw how many people were poor and how many kids my age went to school hungry in the morning, which I don&#39;t think most of my contemporaries in racially segregated schools in the South thought very much about at the time.;Charles Kuralt;morning 48342;Your computer needn&#39;t be the first thing your see in the morning and the last thing you see at night.;Simon Mainwaring;morning 48343;Acting is invigorating. But I don&#39;t analyse it too much. It&#39;s like a dog smelling where it&#39;s going to do its toilet in the morning.;Liam Neeson;morning 48344;I do believe at the end of the night when you&#39;re with your family, the character gets hung up on the door like a coat, and is there to be taken on the next morning.;Liam Neeson;morning 48345;As far as I&#39;m concerned, the entire reason for becoming a writer is not having to get up in the morning.;Neil Gaiman;morning 48346;You can&#39;t be as old as I am without waking up with a surprised look on your face every morning: &#39;Holy Christ, whaddya know - I&#39;m still around!&#39; It&#39;s absolutely amazing that I survived all the booze and smoking and the cars and the career.;Paul Newman;morning 48347;It&#39;s wonderful to have the most important thing in the world there first thing in the morning. And especially in this business, where the opportunity to think everything is about you is there every day, now I really know that it isn&#39;t all about me.;Kate Beckinsale;morning 48348;It didn&#39;t matter what you look like. You don&#39;t have to get up at 5:30 in the morning and there&#39;s a lot to be said for that. Corpse Bride can just play all my parts from now on and I&#39;ll just do the voice.;Helena Bonham Carter;morning 48349;This morning, I went to wipe my hands on a tea towel, and while I was using it, it seemed like it felt a bit light.

That&#39;s where I want to be and I still wake up in the morning with melodies in my head.;Bono;morning 48351;I&#39;ve been keeping a diary for thirty-three years and write in it every morning. Most of it&#39;s just whining, but every so often there&#39;ll be something I can use later: a joke, a description, a quote. It&#39;s an invaluable aid when it comes to winning arguments. &#39;That&#39;s not what you said on February 3, 1996,&#39; I&#39;ll say to someone.;David Sedaris;morning 48352;I pray every night before I go to sleep and every morning when I wake up.;Demi Lovato;morning 48353;Do you know how many calories are in butter and cheese and ice cream?

Sometimes I get up very early in the morning and enjoy a quiet house and cup of tea before the craziness begins. Other times, I&#39;ll take a quick walk on the beach. You can find peace in a few minutes.;Cindy Crawford;morning 48355;I&#39;m actually one of those people who get up energetic in the morning.;Elizabeth Edwards;morning 48356;I was taught that to create anything you had to believe in failure, simply because you had to be prepared to go through an idea without any fear.

It allowed you to get up in the morning and take the pillow off your head.;Malcolm Mclaren;morning 48357;I became a musician so I wouldn&#39;t have to get up at 6 in the morning.;Norah Jones;morning 48358;My father-in-law gets up at 5 o&#39;clock in the morning and watches the Discovery Channel. I don&#39;t know why there&#39;s this big rush to do this.;Jeff Foxworthy;morning 48359;Let me tell you, it is still morning in America.

Manifest Destiny. Conceived in liberty. Fear itself. Ask not. Morning in America. United we stand. Yes, we can. In times of great change and tumult, presidents seek to inspire beleaguered Americans by reminding them of their national identity.;Ron Fournier;morning 48364;I hear that 5 o&#39;clock whistle in my mind like Fred Flintstone and I have to stop. I&#39;m also not much of a morning writer. I have a sweet spot from about 11am to 4pm. But I really work during that time.;Diablo Cody;morning 48365;I am never at my best in the early morning, especially a cold morning in the Yorkshire spring with a piercing March wind sweeping down from the fells, finding its way inside my clothing, nipping at my nose and ears.;James Herriot;morning 48366;I wake up in the morning, I do a little stretching exercises, pick up the horn and play.;Herb Alpert;morning 48367;If you&#39;re the village blacksmith and a model T comes along, you better become a mechanic. People&#39;s lives are better when they get news online versus having to wait for the morning paper. It&#39;s a lot more efficient, a lot more real time, a lot less waste.;Marc Andreessen;morning 48368;If I want to get work done, that&#39;s usually about 3 in the morning.;Marc Andreessen;morning 48369;I see myself at 7:30 in the morning and it&#39;s not too pretty.;Rod Stewart;morning 48370;I like being in movies that have a great story. I&#39;m not so interested in being a Hollywood star. It&#39;s a job, you know. When you wake up at six in the morning every day for a week, it feels like hard work.;Kristen Stewart;morning 48371;&#39;Not again!&#39; I thought to myself this morning, as news trickled out that John McCain was set to pick Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. Not again, because too often women are promoted for the wrong reasons, and then blamed when things don&#39;t go right.;Dee Dee Myers;morning 48372;Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse. Murphy&#39;s First Corollary If you tell the boss you were late for work because you had a flat tire, the next morning you will have a flat tire.;George Edward Woodberry;morning 48373;I can&#39;t tell you enough about cinnamon. Cinnamon is an awesome spice to use and it goes great with something like apples in the morning or in a mixture of fruit or in your oatmeal or even in your cereal.;Emeril Lagasse;morning 48374;My favorite meal would have to be good old-fashioned eggs, over easy, with bacon. Many others, but you can&#39;t beat that on a Sunday morning, especially with a cup of tea.;Gary Oldman;morning 48375;No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.;Bram Stoker;morning 48376;I love the smell of shampoo on a girl&#39;s hair. You can walk past someone and be like, &#39;Wow, you took a shower this morning, didn&#39;t you? Because you smell lovely.</p><p>When I travel, I like to take advantage of room service. I&#39;m really into eggs Benedict in the morning.</p><p>There is a one woman in China that claimed she paid $50 to get my e-mail address. It was pretty shocking. I got one this morning from Scotland. A girl&#39;s requesting a signed photo of me.</p><p>First of all, let me say, 1:15 in the morning, for 20,000 people to still be here, I wasn&#39;t the winner, tennis was. That&#39;s awesome. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever felt so good here before.</p><p>In the morning we received some very thin coffee. For lunch we had potato soup with a few pieces of meat in it, in the evening we had a very thin meat soup with some potatoes in it.</p><p>I woke up one morning to find I was famous. I bought a white Rolls-Royce and drove down Sunset Boulevard, wearing dark specs and a white suit, waving like the Queen Mum.</p><p>I am not a morning person. I like to sleep in.</p><p>I try to make films that I find exciting. It makes me want to get out of bed at five in the morning, have my make-up done and play for the rest of the day.</p><p>Making films can be absolutely fantastic, but it can also be incredibly dull. You spend the whole day sitting by yourself in your trailer and then you get called to deliver one sentence - then you&#39;re told to come back and do it again at 5:30 the following morning.</p><p>What&#39;s the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning? Wish I hadn&#39;t.</p><p>I drink a bucket of white tea in the morning. I read about this tea of the Emperor of China, which is supposedly the tea of eternal youth. It&#39;s called Silver Needle. It&#39;s unbelievably expensive, but I get it on the Web.</p><p>It was really like waking up one morning and going, Wow, I enjoy being with this person more than anybody else in my life, and it just turned out to be mutual.</p><p>I have never been bored an hour in my life. I get up every morning wondering what new strange glamorous thing is going to happen and it happens at fairly regular intervals.</p><p>Get up tomorrow early in the morning, and earlier than you did today, and do the best that you can. Always stay near me, for tomorrow I will have much to do and more than I ever had, and tomorrow blood will leave my body above the breast.</p><p>I&#39;d hate to be a teetotaler. Imagine getting up in the morning and knowing that&#39;s as good as you&#39;re going to feel all day.</p><p>I get up early in the morning, 4 o&#39;clock, and I sit at my desk and what I do is just dream. After three or four hours, that&#39;s enough. In the afternoon, I run.</p><p>Somebody said to me this morning, &#39;To what do you attribute your longevity?&#39; I don&#39;t know. I mean, I couldn&#39;t have planned my life out better. By all accounts I should be dead! The abuse I put my body through: the drugs, the alcohol, the lifestyle I&#39;ve lived the last 30 years!</p><p>Training is full-on. Some days I really don&#39;t want to get out of bed and hit that track again. Sunday and Monday morning sessions are always horrible. But who really looks forward to going to work on a Monday morning?</p><p>I&#39;ll never forget one morning I walked in and I had a hell of a bruise - it had been a difficult night the night before - and a client said to me, &#39;Good God, Vidal, what happened to your face?&#39; And I said, &#39;Oh, nothing, madam, I just fell over a hairpin.&#39;</p><p>I should just put it bluntly, because we&#39;re all sort of friends here now - it&#39;s exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. Oh, so Jesus, what a thought! You know that&#39;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o&#39;clock in the morning, and I don&#39;t want to go there.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing in the world more silent than the telephone the morning after everybody pans your play. It won&#39;t ring from room service your mother won&#39;t be calling you. If the phone has not rung by 8 in the morning, you&#39;re dead.</p><p>Old times&#39; never come back and I suppose it&#39;s just as well. What comes back is a new morning every day in the year, and that&#39;s better.;George Edward Woodberry;morning 48398;There is a fundamental situation in which the country has reached rock bottom, that a mother can&#39;t send her children out of the house in the morning.

You&#39;re online at 8 a.m. on a Sunday or midnight on a Wednesday. It&#39;s a job that you never push aside.;James Daly;morning 48401;Each morning my characters greet me with misty faces willing, though chilled, to muster for another day&#39;s progress through the dazzling quicksand the marsh of blank paper.;John Updike;morning 48402;You always say &#39;I&#39;ll quit when I start to slide&#39;, and then one morning you wake up and realize you&#39;ve done slid.;Sugar Ray Robinson;morning 48403;I&#39;m not one of those writers I learned about who get up in the morning, put a piece of paper in their typewriter machine and start writing. That I&#39;ve never understood.;Wole Soyinka;morning 48404;When I first broke through, there was only NBC, CBS and ABC, and they had news in the morning and in the evening - there wasn&#39;t no 24-hour news.;Dick Gregory;morning 48405;If you do cardio one day and the next day you can do weights, do it that way. If you need to do it at night or in the morning, do it that way.

We try to devote time in the morning, say a prayer.;Carrie Underwood;morning 48407;I wake up every morning happy for where I am in life. It&#39;s not all about the cooking, but the fact that I can contribute by using my influence to help people all over the country. In the last two years, my partners and I have fed more than 10 million hungry people by bringing meat to food banks.;Paula Deen;morning 48408;In order to have good fried chicken, you should wash and season the bird the morning you&#39;re preparing it for dinner.

Throw it in the refrigerator, seasoned, that morning, and give it a chance to soak up all the salt and pepper and goodness.;Paula Deen;morning 48409;Yes, there&#39;s such a thing as luck in trial law but it only comes at 3 o&#39;clock in the morning.

It depends on what kind of night that I had. I accept myself and the way that I am growing older. I have eye bags and some people have proposed to me to take them out but I said no.;Antonio Banderas;morning 48415;I wake up every morning, look in the mirror and ask, &#39;Am I a sex symbol?&#39; Then I go back to bed again. It&#39;s stupid to think that way.;Antonio Banderas;morning 48416;But when I felt like I had something to prove? Then I got up early every morning and worked all day long. I didn&#39;t know if I had any more talent than anyone else directing, but I knew I could work hard at it, and so I did.;Ben Affleck;morning 48417;Since I travel so much, it&#39;s always great to be home.

They pay their taxes and they want to know that the same kind of decision-making is taking place for those on benefits.;Iain Duncan Smith;morning 48424;Nowadays, everybody assumes, when they wake up in the morning, if they have a question, it will get answered. Because they have the internet. No matter what the question is, someone will answer their question.;Jack White;morning 48425;Sometimes I wish that there were a way to let people know that just because I live in a world without rules, and in a life that is lawless, doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t hurt so bad the morning after.;Elizabeth Wurtzel;morning 48426;We all wake up in the morning wanting to live our lives the way we know we should. But we usually don&#39;t, in small ways. That&#39;s what makes a character like Batman so fascinating.

I love to be in my bathroom with my candles lit, morning, noon and night. I like taking hot baths and hot showers, using my body scrubs and lotions.;Traci Bingham;morning 48435;I will check the internet for at least an hour every morning scanning worldwide news to do with child abuse.

I want you to have clean tongues, clean manners, clean morals and clean characters.;John Burns;morning 48438;It&#39;s never really that much fun for me to do movies anyway, because you - you know, you have to get up very early in the morning and you have to go in and you spend a lot of time waiting around.;Al Pacino;morning 48439;Look, I hate to sound like Pollyanna, but I literally can&#39;t wait to get to work in the morning.

I&#39;d be a pig not to be grateful.;Christopher Meloni;morning 48440;I&#39;m very silly as a person, but quality silliness on-screen has more of an art to it.

I thought somehow she would be convinced by the strength of his criticism about capital.;Shimon Peres;morning 48444;As a child, I had to get up early for school or work. I&#39;d get ready by myself.

I did it alone, my parents never coming in to wake me up.;Janet Jackson;morning 48445;I know I have to be like people expect, because people love to dream with me, they like to think that I love my boat of 50 metres, that I drink Cristal for breakfast, that I dance until five o&#39;clock in the morning. I am not like that.;Roberto Cavalli;morning 48446;I don&#39;t have a single complete show or movie or anything else that I could look at and say, &#39;Nailed that one.&#39; But endless dissatisfaction is, I suppose, what gets us out of bed in the morning.;Hugh Laurie;morning 48447;I get up in the morning and do a seven-minute yoga workout.

There they are, and they are beautiful.;Pete Hamill;morning 48450;One thing that happens when you&#39;re pregnant is that as your stomach starts to stretch. It itches!

It&#39;s really like basting a turkey with body butter.;Padma Lakshmi;morning 48451;If you read about Mussolini or Stalin or some of these other great monsters of history, they were at it all the time, that they were getting up in the morning very early.

I love dancing to anything with a good beat really. My favorite song to dance to at the moment is probably Drake&#39;s &#39;Best I Ever Had.</p><p>I&#39;m a car fanatic and each morning I wake up with a smile on my face, whether I&#39;m commentating on the Formula One or at Silver Hatch racetrack in Roary the Racing Car.</p><p>The day of the sun is like the day of a king. It is a promenade in the morning, a sitting on the throne at noon, a pageant in the evening.</p><p>When you walk out of your house in the morning, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to see.</p><p>Chronic malnutrition, or the lack of proper nutrition over time directly contributes to three times as many child deaths as food scarcity. Yet surprisingly, you don&#39;t really hear about this hidden crisis through the morning news, Twitter or headlines of major newspapers.</p><p>I worked at Salon.com way back when they started, and there&#39;s just unmeasurable value to distributing words online, too, but I still get my news from the newspaper in the morning.</p><p>I mean, if you have to wake up in the morning to be validated by the editorial page of the New York Times, you got a pretty sorry existence.</p><p>Early this morning, I signed my death warrant.</p><p>For me the greatest revenge of all is having a happy adulthood, waking up in my gorgeous turquoise bedroom in the morning beside a person who really inspires me. That&#39;s the best revenge a girl-loving girl from the Bible belt could possibly have. And, importantly, it&#39;s healthy.</p><p>For us political activists and candidates, the morning after any election is a mix of emotions - the personal and the immediate, the culmination of your own recent campaigning efforts and the fortunes of your party and the success or otherwise of what you stand for and believe in.</p><p>One morning, about four o&#39;clock, I was driving my car just about as fast as I could. I thought, Why am I out this time of night? I was miserable, and it came to me: I&#39;m falling in love with somebody I have no right to fall in love with.</p><p>I think my real depressions started when I was about 16 and doing The Patty Duke Show. I would go to bed at about 10 o&#39;clock on a Friday night and not get up again until 6:30 Monday morning.</p><p>Good Morning America&#39; exploited Joan Lunden&#39;s pregnancy, but you won&#39;t see me bringing my babies on the air. The only reason I&#39;m talking about the babies at all is that they&#39;ve been with me on the show since I became pregnant. After a while, I had to acknowledge this pumpkin tummy.;Jane Pauley;morning 48467;A muscle is like a car. If you want it to run well early in the morning, you have to warm it up.;Florence Griffith Joyner;morning 48468;I don&#39;t want to clip on the armour every morning. I&#39;ve seen some politicians do this and they get a bit mangled and bitter. I just refuse to do that. I refuse to be angry or bitter or complain, and I remain open. I may sometimes be a bit too open but I&#39;m not going to change that one bit.;Nick Clegg;morning 48469;One thing I&#39;ve very quickly learned is that if you wake up every morning worrying about what&#39;s in the press, you would go completely and utterly potty.;Nick Clegg;morning 48470;I&#39;ve done the most awful rubbish in order to have somewhere to go in the morning.;Richard Burton;morning 48471;What is news? It&#39;s hard to quantify. Certainly news has changed completely, and the morning shows are not really designed to bring you the news, except to tell you what happened overnight, and the rest of it is a kind of magazine mentality - a little bit of this, a little bit of that. It&#39;s harder to be an educated and informed citizen.;Harrison Ford;morning 48472;The average, healthy, well-adjusted adult gets up at seven-thirty in the morning feeling just plain terrible.;Jean Kerr;morning 48473;I want to host a religious show. I&#39;m sure nobody will be wanting the 11 o&#39;clock spot on Sunday morning. I think we should really get some of our own preachers and preach that gay is good. And we&#39;d have a great choir.;Kate Clinton;morning 48474;Previously, on Lock, Stock, I went to bed at two in the morning and woke up at five in the morning, and on this one I was known to nod off on the set occasionally.;Guy Ritchie;morning 48475;We went to a small lake, Bass Lake. It was beautiful. It was perfectly still when we got there in the morning. The fog was lifting off the water. It was just magical. And we did catch some fish, 13 fish.;Jennifer Granholm;morning 48476;We awoke one morning in September, and the world lurched on its axis.;Jeb Bush;morning 48477;I don&#39;t wake up each morning saying, &#39;Oh, wow, it&#39;s me. I think I&#39;m the cat&#39;s meow. I&#39;m the best.</p><p>I am a fashion designer. I&#39;m not an environmentalist. When I get up in the morning, number one I&#39;m a mother and a wife, and number two I design clothes. So the main thing I need to do is create, hopefully, exquisitely beautiful, desirable objects for my customer.</p><p>It was huge to read the Proverbs of the day every morning, it was huge to read the Psalm of the day every morning and to get that in us and get us going before the day even started.</p><p>You know how you wake up in the morning and sometimes you look gorgeous and other times you look like you got hit by a mack truck? I realized that my mack truck is food. If I have no sugar, yeast or wine, I have no undereye bags and my skin is perfect.</p><p>I exercise every morning. I do light weights - 5lb and 10lb arm exercises - and then lie and lift my arms and legs. It&#39;s all about keeping core strength. I do a lot of stretching too.</p><p>Later, in the early teens, I used to ride my bike every Saturday morning to the nearest airport, ten miles away, push airplanes in and out of the hangars, and clean up the hangars.</p><p>My days, if they start in the morning with a cuddle from my son, are just so much more glorious than they were prior to that.</p><p>Every morning I wake at 6am or 6.30am, champing at the bit.</p><p>The quality of life is so much higher anyplace you can ski in the morning and surf in the evening - there&#39;s something to be said for that.</p><p>I had the perfect job for a gamer. From February to October, I&#39;d get up at 7 in the morning with nothing to do but play games until I had to be at the park around 1 or 2 o&#39;clock. When I got back after the game, I played until 3 or 4 in the morning.</p><p>I started running 3 miles every morning after throat surgery to remove a cyst last year. The gym used to be my adversary. But that has all changed. Now, I look forward to it every morning.</p><p>Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I am like, &#39;This is a high-top day&#39; or &#39;This is a bob day,&#39; but when I get my clothes on that&#39;s when I see.</p><p>When I get up in the morning and put on a pink or a green wig, I see myself as a piece of animation. It lets me be the person I want to be, a person who&#39;s not embarrassed to have fun.</p><p>My brain is so anxiety-prone, like a pinball machine. If I don&#39;t get up in the morning and focus my thinking, my breathing, and my being for about 12 minutes, I&#39;m just a screwball all day long.</p><p>I always like to start my morning with a good amount of fruit. I really like pineapple, particularly because of the enzymes that it has. Sometimes I have oatmeal. But if I&#39;m feeling like I really want to be watching my weight more, then I definitely do a protein, like an omelet, scrambled eggs or some smoked salmon.</p><p>Couldn&#39;t start the morning without caffeine.</p><p>I really am super lazy and doing long hair, especially mine, is a big pain in the butt. It&#39;s filled with cowlicks and kinks and curls and frizz - and it was taking too much time in the morning.</p><p>I loved fantasy, but I particularly loved the stories in which somebody got out of where they were and into somewhere better - as in the &#39;Chronicles Of Narnia,&#39; &#39;The Wizard Of Oz,&#39; &#39;The Phantom Tollbooth,&#39; the &#39;Dungeons &amp;amp Dragons&#39; cartoon on Saturday morning in the &#39;80s.</p><p>I have an orthopedic pillow that&#39;s made out of a sponge material. I have a plate in my throat, and I have to be careful or I could end up with a bad neck in the morning. That pillow is a must everywhere I go.</p><p>When you really deep down look at it, we go to bed every night, get up every morning, stay here for 70 or 80 years, and then we die.</p><p>The most used piece of kit in my kitchen is my saucepan. I use it every morning to cook my porridge in. The least used piece of equipment? I&#39;d say a food mixer. I&#39;ve never used it, I don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re for.</p><p>I have a Viking stove. The color is butter lemon, and I had to wait several months for it, because that color wasn&#39;t available and I really wanted butter lemon! But I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s seriously ever been cooked on. I mean, I make tea every morning. Does that count?</p><p>Thanks to the greatest invention of recent years, the MP3-playing alarm clock, I can now choose the song that wakes me up in the morning.</p><p>Stood off and on during the night, determining not to come to anchor till morning, fearing to meet with shoals continued our course in the morning and as the island was found to be six or seven leagues distant, and the tide was against us, it was noon when we arrived there.</p><p>Tomorrow morning before we depart, I intend to land and see what can be found in the neighborhood.</p><p>You&#39;ve got to set yourself up to be as healthy as you can. The thing we tend to do is when it gets to be a bit too hard, we actually opt out for the absolute worst option. For example, if you&#39;re in a rush in a morning and you feel like you don&#39;t have time to make breakfast, you skip it.</p><p>I&#39;m not a morning person. I&#39;m really not.</p><p>My extravagance is my garden - it&#39;s the first thing I look at every morning when I wake up. It gives me so much pleasure.</p><p>It is a challenge, with the global fame, to try to act like I put my pants on one leg at a time, when in fact I have Pippa Middleton help me put my pants on every morning. She&#39;s my lady-in-waiting as well.</p><p>I never laugh or smile when I am writing. When I come home for lunch after writing all morning, my wife says I look like I just came home from a funeral. This is not bragging. This is an illness.</p><p>When I wake up in the morning, I feel like a billionaire without paying taxes.</p><p>I wake up early in the morning and walk for an hour. If I have something to write, I prefer to write in the morning until midday, and in the afternoon, I eat.</p><p>I was a government employee in the morning and a writer in the evening.</p><p>I kind of woke up one morning and was like, &#39;Oh I see what&#39;s happening, I get everything&#39;. I woke up and was like, &#39;I get it, I&#39;m a product.&#39;</p><p>We were doing it under the most extraordinary circumstances, but the first out of the tent in the morning would be David Lean. He said to me on the very first day of shooting, Pete, this is the beginning of a great adventure.</p><p>Most songs have meager beginnings. You wake up in the morning, you throw on your suspenders, and you subvocalize and just think. They seem to form like calcium. I can&#39;t think of a story right off the bat that was that interesting. I write things on the back of my hand, usually, and sing into a tape recorder.</p><p>Hitchhiking was such a pure form of existence. You&#39;d wake up in the morning, and you&#39;d have no idea what your day was going to be. And that&#39;s something I&#39;ve never been able to shake. I loved that.</p><p>I had the closest thing I have ever had to an out-of-body experience lying in bed one morning. I turned on the &#39;Today&#39; programme and item four on the news was: &#39;The shadow chancellor has ruled himself out of the leadership.&#39; I lay there thinking that&#39;s interesting, then I realised it was me.</p><p>I half knew what to expect when I saw the cricket ground in the morning. It was when I started to talk to people working out there, I began to find what I was looking for.</p><p>I wake up laughing. Yes, I wake up in the morning and there I am just laughing my head off.</p><p>I love such mirth as does not make friends ashamed to look upon one another next morning.</p><p>I am really passionate about my career and my music and I am so lucky to be able to do what I do for a job, so for all the early morning starts and long days, I could never trade it all in.</p><p>London is completely unpredictable when it comes to weather. You&#39;ll start a scene, and it&#39;s a beautiful morning. You get there at 6 in the morning, set up, you start the scene, start shooting. Three hours later, it is pitch black and rainy.</p><p>I derive no pleasure from prosecuting a man, even though I know he&#39;s guilty do you think I could sleep at night or look at myself in the mirror in the morning if I hounded an innocent man?</p><p>I was the type of guy that used to get up in the morning and go out and just out run everybody on the field without stretching or warming up or anything.</p><p>Of all the songs I&#39;ve recorded, &#39;Amarillo By Morning&#39; always sticks out in my mind.</p><p>I don&#39;t mind traveling that much when I can go somewhere and stay there for a while, but touring is different. You rarely see anything. You get there early in the morning and you&#39;re resting all day, and you go in and do a sound check, and you do the show, and then bam you&#39;re gone.</p><p>The repose of sleep refreshes only the body. It rarely sets the soul at rest. The repose of the night does not belong to us. It is not the possession of our being. Sleep opens within us an inn for phantoms. In the morning we must sweep out the shadows.</p><p>Too much coffee. Too much coffee and Gatorade. It&#39;s a hell of a mix. If you&#39;re ever tired in the morning, just try that mix, and tell me what you think.</p><p>My principal motivation is supporting my family, which is not a bad reason for getting up in the morning. That&#39;s always been my motivation - to take care of the people who rely on me.</p><p>I have to say that when you tour the world, obviously, the jetlags and different hours and ways of living and traveling, a lot of hours in the plane, and you wake up in the morning and you&#39;re not quite sure where you are, and it is very tiring.</p><p>If we were to wake up some morning and find that everyone was the same race, creed and color, we would find some other causes for prejudice by noon.</p><p>I eat as much as the next girl, but I work my butt of in the gym every morning! The key is moderation. I splurge on the weekend. A big bowl of pasta and a delicious slice of cake for dessert are my favorites.</p><p>In live action movies, you just hope that everything works. Because the actor may had a bad morning and doesn&#39;t play good, or accidents happen continuously. Many things contradict what you are trying to say. But in cartoons, nothing contradict what you want to say.</p><p>I&#39;ve never been a TV junkie. I remember watching Letterman way back when he had a morning show.</p><p>If you&#39;re changing the world, you&#39;re working on important things. You&#39;re excited to get up in the morning.</p><p>My wife gets all the money I make. I just get an apple and clean clothes every morning.</p><p>Wherever my story takes me, however dark and difficult the theme, there is always some hope and redemption, not because readers like happy endings, but because I am an optimist at heart. I know the sun will rise in the morning, that there is a light at the end of every tunnel.</p><p>What I couldn&#39;t help noticing was that I learned more about the novel in a morning by trying to write a page of one than I&#39;d learned in seven years or so of trying to write criticism.</p><p>I was so obsessed by this problem that I was thinking about it all the time - when I woke up in the morning, when I went to sleep at night - and that went on for eight years.</p><p>There&#39;s also a sense of freedom. I was so obsessed by this problem that I was thinking about if all the time - when I woke up in the morning, when I went to sleep at night, and that went on for eight years.</p><p>Prince used to call me up 3am in the morning and invite me to hear some of his new songs.</p><p>The one ironclad rule is that I have to try. I have to walk into my writing room and pick up my pen every weekday morning.</p><p>To drive an F1 car you have to be a little mad. On the morning of a race there&#39;s a mix of excitement and fear. If it&#39;s a wet track, then it&#39;s worse as you&#39;re not in control most of the time, which is the thing all drivers fear the most.</p><p>A lot of people think Formula One isn&#39;t a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning. But we&#39;re pulling up to six G on a corner or during breaking, which is almost like being a fighter pilot. So we have to do a lot of work on our neck muscles.</p><p>How many women have the courage to start properly with a cold, cold bath early in the morning? I jump in, throw the water, cold as ice, and after the first plunge I am happy.</p><p>I am not a morning person.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t wait for the sun to come up the next morning so that I could get out on the course again.</p><p>Whereas I used to get depressed or neurotic or dwell on things, I see my son&#39;s bright eyes and smile in the morning, and suddenly, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m depressed anymore. There&#39;s nothing to be depressed about when you&#39;ve got that.</p><p>Most of the top actors and actresses may be working in ten or twelve films at the same time, so they will give one director two hours and maybe shoot in Bombay in the morning and Madras in the evening. It happens.</p><p>The question is the morning after. What sort of Iraq do we wake up to after the bombing? What happens in the region? What impact could it have? These are questions leaders I have spoken to have posed.</p><p>I never really drank coffee in college, but now I&#39;m on my feet all day and out all night and can&#39;t believe it hasn&#39;t always been in my life. When morning comes I crave it.</p><p>The thing with me is, if I wake up one morning and I&#39;m not happy working as an actress, I&#39;ll stop. It&#39;s not something I have to do. It&#39;s not a vocation.</p><p>Those golden minutes before you are completely awake, when your mind is just drifting, you have no censorship you are ready to develop any kind of idea. That&#39;s when I come up with the best and worst ideas. That is the privilege of being a writer - that you can stay in bed for an hour in the morning and it&#39;s work time.</p><p>The episodes all blend together for me, so I don&#39;t remember. I can&#39;t even remember what I had for breakfast this morning. I always feel I must be such a disappointment to them.</p><p>I still love doing what I do, and I&#39;m really lucky to get up in the morning and want to go to work.</p><p>It seems to me madness to wake up in the morning and do something other than paint, considering that one may not wake up the following morning.</p><p>Now, on nights that I can&#39;t sleep, I play video games alone until the morning.</p><p>In West Virginia, the most vulnerable people we have are people who get up every morning and go to work.</p><p>She got the magazine on a Wednesday morning, and on Thursday announced our marriage was over.</p><p>I don&#39;t go to Mass every day. But I go to church every day. Just sitting there, thinking - it&#39;s a great way to start the morning, you know? You feel so good coming out, and your approach to everything is suddenly really clear.</p><p>But to the slave mother New Year&#39;s day comes laden with peculiar sorrows. She sits on her cold cabin floor, watching the children who may all be torn from her the next morning and often does she wish that she and they might die before the day dawns.</p><p>On the last morning of Virginia&#39;s bloodiest year since the Civil War, I built a fire and sat facing a window of darkness where at sunrise I knew I would find the sea.</p><p>I spent every night until four in the morning on my dissertation, until I came to the point when I could not write another word, not even the next letter. I went to bed. Eight o&#39;clock the next morning I was up writing again.</p><p>You know, the market was down yesterday... my first thought when I heard-just on a personal basis, when I heard there had been this attack and I saw the futures this morning, which were really in the tank, I thought, Time to buy.</p><p>I have a hotline to the tabloids. When I get up in the morning, I call the Star, and the last thing at night, I call them. I want them to have the inside track.</p><p>Normal people don&#39;t just wake up in the morning and say I think it&#39;d be a good idea to run for president of the United States.</p><p>The attorney general would call at 5 o&#39;clock in the evening and say: &#39;Tomorrow morning we are going to try to integrate the University of Mississippi. Get us a memo on what we&#39;re likely to do, and what we can do if the governor sends the National Guard there.&#39;</p><p>I am a morning writer I am writing at eight-thirty in longhand and I keep at it until twelve-thirty, when I go for a swim. Then I come back, have lunch, and read in the afternoon until I take my walk for the next day&#39;s writing.</p><p>Both my mum and dad were great readers, and we would go every Saturday morning to the library, and my sister and I had a library card when we could pass off something as a signature, and all of us would come with an armful of books.</p><p>If I&#39;m playing in the morning, I&#39;ll get some carbs early: porridge with chopped banana. If I&#39;m playing in the afternoon, I&#39;ll start with less carbs and have some eggs and fruit for breakfast, then a light lunch about 90 minutes before I play, so I don&#39;t feel sluggish or full.</p><p>Remember my first tenet in getting dressed is how you feel in the morning. So if you&#39;re not being true blue to that, it usually shows.</p><p>Yes, I still love &#39;South Park,&#39; but I also love morning TV now.</p><p>We hear the stories every day now: the father who puts on a suit every morning and leaves the house so his daughter doesn&#39;t know he lost his job, the recent college grad facing up to the painful reality that the only door that&#39;s open to her after four years of study and a pile of debt is her parents&#39;. These are the faces of the Obama economy.</p><p>I was shocked by the amount of Welsh people in L.A. We&#39;d go to this British pub to watch the &#39;Six Nations&#39; early in the morning and I remember the first time I walked in it was just a sea of red.</p><p>I&#39;m obsessed with radio. It&#39;s a good start to Sunday morning.</p><p>A real New Yorker likes the sound of a garbage truck in the morning.</p><p>I am up at 3:30, reading the op-ed pages and getting ready to be on the air by 6 A.M. on the set of &#39;Morning Joe,&#39; and after three hours of TV and two hours on the radio, it is only 12 noon.</p><p>I have mugs of hot water every morning because the studio is cold, and also because it makes my throat sound clearer.</p><p>My salary situation at &#39;Morning Joe&#39; wasn&#39;t right. I made five attempts to fix it, then realized I&#39;d made the same mistake every time: I apologised for asking.</p><p>On &#39;Morning Joe&#39; I can say what I think, be my sometimes unorthodox self, have fun, yet be serious as well.</p><p>You&#39;d have to think that you&#39;re at least decent, or you couldn&#39;t get up every morning and do it. I think if I live long enough, I might be pretty good.</p><p>I wake up every morning in a cold sweat, regardless of how well things went the day before. And put that I said that in a somewhat but not completely tongue-in-cheek way.</p><p>When a man has been consistently battering his wife, he shouldn&#39;t expect a bouquet of roses from her the morning after he promises to stop.</p><p>You&#39;ve got to get up every morning with determination if you&#39;re going to go to bed with satisfaction.</p><p>I had an amazing childhood, lots of love. But my dad worked his tail off, getting up at 4 in the morning and going off at 5, 6 o&#39;clock, yet he always had time to spend with his kids and his wife.</p><p>I have to say when we talk about the treatment of these prisoners that I would guess that these prisoners wake up every morning thanking Allah that Saddam Hussein is not in charge of these prisons.</p><p>How can a doctor judge a woman&#39;s sanity by merely bidding her good morning and refusing to hear her pleas for release? Even the sick ones know it is useless to say anything, for the answer will be that it is their imagination.</p><p>Even as a kid, I never liked breakfast. I just don&#39;t like to eat then. I like to get up and work. I think sticking a whole bunch of carbohydrates in your stomach in the morning is probably the worst way to begin the day.</p><p>The worst part about pregnancy would definitely have to be my nausea. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s just called morning sickness because morning sickness never just happened in the morning for me and it&#39;s not happening just in the morning for my sister.</p><p>I&#39;m set to have my best year ever: I&#39;m hiring some acts and there will be a show in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening. I&#39;m going to use my theater to its fullest potential.</p><p>It&#39;s not easy waking up every single morning knowing what you&#39;re going to put your body through and having to do it. We don&#39;t have days off.</p><p>I&#39;ve found myself at one in the morning just sitting at my desk spending an hour returning emails from the day until like two in the morning. It&#39;s ridiculous, I should be sleeping, or dreaming, or reading a novel.</p><p>The boy who expects every morning to open into a new world finds that today is like yesterday, but he believes tomorrow will be different.</p><p>My life had become a catastrophe. I had no idea how to turn it around. My band had broken up. I had almost lost my family. My whole life had devolved into a disaster. I believe that the police officer who stopped me at three a.m. that morning saved my life.</p><p>The greatest job I ever had was working on my family farm. Each morning my father would come into my bedroom around 4:30 am and command me to get up and work the fields. I would spend the next two hours before school slopping pigs and cropping tobacco.</p><p>It only worked for a little while the morning after I agreed to go with Universal, an article came out in the Hollywood trade papers, and the secret was out.</p><p>Every time I get up in the morning, melodies occur to me and I start trying to shape lyrics to melodies.</p><p>Never get married in the morning - you never know who you might meet that night.</p><p>I never thought in a million years I&#39;d be that healthy girl who wakes up every morning to exercise. After being called &#39;cherubic and chubby,&#39; I&#39;m rocking a bikini!</p><p>You were up at 5 o&#39;clock in the morning, and then you&#39;d ride in a caravan, because we didn&#39;t have big movie trucks or trailers that is the hardware of a movie camp.</p><p>I don&#39;t have to get up in the morning and go beat up my body like I used to. I don&#39;t have to be out there in August in 108 degree weather down in Texas.</p><p>Waking up with a bad head in the morning is difficult sometimes.</p><p>There&#39;s some things you just have to live with. Like twelve cars camping outside your house, and when you wake up in the morning, they&#39;re going to follow you wherever you go. It helps that I live in Valencia. It eliminates some. But they&#39;re still here.</p><p>You show up in Paris, and on the drive from the airport to the hotel you&#39;re like, &#39;This is so cool! I want to see something!

I&#39;ve been so bad on the upkeep, though.</p><p>A city with one newspaper, or with a morning and an evening paper under one ownership, is like a man with one eye, and often the eye is glass.</p><p>Probably millions of Americans got up this morning with a cup of coffee, a cigarette and a donut. No wonder they are sick and fouled up.</p><p>Yeah, I&#39;m not really a morning person.</p><p>Let me tell you, sisters, seeing dried egg on a plate in the morning is a lot dirtier than anything I&#39;ve had to deal with in politics.</p><p>Sydney in general is eclectic. You can be on that brilliant blue ocean walk in the morning and then within 20 minutes you can be in a completely vast suburban sprawl or an Italian or Asian suburb, and it&#39;s that mix of people, it&#39;s that melting pot of people that give it its vital personality.</p><p>It seems a long time since the morning mail could be called correspondence.</p><p>I tend to start at 9 o&#39;clock in the morning and write until 3. Those are my best hours. They fit the other rhythms of the world. So I write for six hours, pretty much without any breaks.</p><p>I get up, go and get a coffee, and go do the crossword - I&#39;m loyal to one particular paper, the &#39;Guardian&#39; - and that&#39;s my idea of a perfect morning.</p><p>After the first day of practice, there&#39;s not one guy who&#39;s playing at 100 percent or who feels great. Sometimes, getting up in the morning and brushing your teeth is the hardest part of the day - it just hurts.</p><p>Throughout my 20s I spent a lot of time just playing and not really working, but fortunately for me I continued to get just enough work, and have a reason to wake up in the morning. I really empathize with some of my peers who had success in the early years then it dries up, and so there&#39;s no reason to get up in the morning.</p><p>I try to shave at night so my skin has a chance to settle by the early morning call-time.</p><p>It was morning through the high window I saw the pure, bright blue of the sky as it hovered cheerfully over the long roofs of the neighboring houses. It too seemed full of joy, as if it had special plans, and had put on its finest clothes for the occasion.</p><p>I wake up every morning and I surprise myself. I wake up to a new me.</p><p>I literally have meetings at eight o&#39;clock in the morning, and I finish at nine o&#39;clock at night. It sounds pathetic, but I don&#39;t even have time to go shopping.</p><p>I am focused on what needs to be done for the people of Israel. Period. I do not pity myself and I do not pat myself on the shoulder. I get up in the morning full of energy to fulfill my mission.</p><p>I had three children while doing a show, as demanding as &#39;Good Morning America,&#39; so this is - you know, it&#39;s almost like I&#39;m less daunted about motherhood, and parenting at this point in time. And I think I&#39;m just much more fit and healthy than I was 20-years-ago.</p><p>I&#39;d skip school regularly to see movies - even in the morning, in the small Parisian theaters that opened early.</p><p>The thing I care about is my weight - I&#39;m as fanatical about it as a member of Girls Aloud. I weigh myself every morning. I know exactly what I want to be - 82kg - and I try to stick to it.</p><p>I was a very undisciplined person but acting was something that actually motivated me to get up in the morning. I hadn&#39;t experienced that before, but it was something that really excited me. I think I could be quite self-conscious and it gave me a release.</p><p>What is life, when wanting love? Night without a morning love&#39;s the cloudless summer sun, nature gay adorning.</p><p>I don&#39;t dream songs. I&#39;m more apt to write dreams down and then to be able to interpret them into a song. I also tend to get up and write prose in the morning from which will come songs.</p><p>The crew are the faces you see every morning and last at night before you go home. I spend more time with those people than I do with my friends and family, so they&#39;re forever a part of you and who you become as an actor so I hope I see them again.</p><p>And I have to say, what motivates me every day and I know my Democratic colleagues is to remember that every day 14,000 people get up in the morning with insurance that go to bed at night without it and most of them because they lost their job.</p><p>Nobody has time to keep trying on a load of things in the morning like a teenager.</p><p>Sometimes in the morning, when it&#39;s a good surf, I go out there, and I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a bad world.</p><p>You know, the men go to tea houses with the expectation that they will have a nice quiet evening and not read about it the next morning in the newspaper.</p><p>It&#39;s very important to write things down instantly, or you can lose the way you were thinking out a line. I have a rule that if I wake up at 3 in the morning and think of something, I write it down. I can&#39;t wait until morning - it&#39;ll be gone.</p><p>I&#39;d always been a news junkie, always read lots of newspapers and watched the Sunday morning news shows on TV and felt strongly about issues of power, control, sexuality and race.</p><p>I think it&#39;s good that I had some experience of the real world before I became successful. You know, having to get up in the morning and going to work in construction.</p><p>Chelsea Morning is a great Joni Mitchell song and I guess I&#39;m partial to her lyrics because they show me a slightly different perspective on life.</p><p>If I&#39;m working on a film, I&#39;ll do sit-ups for before I shoot. Like, 100 in the morning or something.</p><p>Four hours of prosthetics every morning, the jowls and the nose, and it was very hot so they&#39;re having to attend to it all day, and you&#39;re still petrified of so many things, such as, can I speak properly? Hitchcock never quite lost those East End vowels, even though he had the softened California consonants.</p><p>When I wake up on a Monday morning and I realise I don&#39;t have to go and work at the civil service, I really think I&#39;ve won.</p><p>Somehow, I&#39;ve been blessed to be able to have the young spirit inside - not feel like every year I get a year older. I feel like every year I get a year younger. I don&#39;t wake up in the morning with aches and pains.</p><p>I open with a clock striking, to beget an awful attention in the audience - it also marks the time, which is four o clock in the morning, and saves a description of the rising sun, and a great deal about gilding the eastern hemisphere.</p><p>I was lucky enough to grow up in a home where I woke up Christmas morning and had toys. I know that&#39;s not the case with all people and I don&#39;t think kids should go without experiencing that sort of joy.</p><p>That&#39;s the biggest part of doing comics: You have to create stuff that makes you want to get out of bed every morning and get to work.</p><p>I trust, that your readers will not construe my words to mean, that I would not have gone to a 3 o&#39;clock in the morning session, for the sake of defeating the Nebraska bill.</p><p>When you were a volunteer for the Bush-Cheney campaign, you came in the morning you had a supervisor who gave you a list of calls to make and a time to do it in.</p><p>It&#39;s such a luxury to be able to be happy about going to work in the morning.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe in writing at night because it comes too easily. When I read it in the morning it&#39;s not good. I need daylight to begin. Between nine and ten o&#39;clock I have a long breakfast with reading and music.</p><p>In the last year my wife has noticed me struggling to get downstairs on a Sunday morning. I&#39;ve two young children and football has been so good to me over the years I don&#39;t want to spoil it.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why you call it morning sickness, because I was sick all day and night!</p><p>What I don&#39;t like is breakfast in the morning. I have a double-espresso cappuccino, but no food.</p><p>It is always with excitement that I wake up in the morning wondering what my intuition will toss up to me, like gifts from the sea. I work with it and rely on it. It&#39;s my partner.</p><p>I never want to make a film. I don&#39;t wake up in the morning going, &#39;Ooh, I&#39;d really love to be on set making a film today&#39;. I&#39;m aware that other contemporary film directors perceive film-making as what they do, as what they have to do. But I would hope that I am more catholic in my tastes.</p><p>I am, in fact, Superman. Every morning I wake up and go into a telephone booth and change my costume, and then go to work.</p><p>I was up late last night yapping about the elections on CNN and up early this morning doing the same thing in my daughter&#39;s kindergarten class.</p><p>In my day, at 12 years old, which was 38 years ago, we worked out in summer months for two and a half hours. Today someone in that age group might work out for four hours, two hours in the morning and two at night.</p><p>I was getting to bed about 10 P.M. so wound up and not getting to sleep by 11, and because I was putting the prosthetics on for five hours, I had to be up at 3 in the morning.</p><p>We don&#39;t watch the film anymore because we&#39;ve seen it so many times, so we&#39;ll introduce it, walk out and we&#39;ll come back in right about when I wake up in the morning and walk over to the shop and everything&#39;s changed.</p><p>O sweet, delusive Noon, Which the morning climbs to find, O moment sped too soon, And morning left behind.</p><p>As soon as I began, it seemed impossible to write fast enough - I wrote faster than I would write a letter - two thousand to three thousand words in a morning, and I cannot help it.</p><p>I had to get up run in the morning for 2 hours, go to the gym and also get good opponents as sparring partners because I&#39;m a big believer in that how you train is how you will fight at least when it came to me that&#39;s how it worked.</p><p>The result was that, if it happened to clear off after a cloudy evening, I frequently arose from my bed at any hour of the night or morning and walked two miles to the observatory to make some observation included in the programme.</p><p>I do Yoga. I&#39;d like to say I do it every morning, but I don&#39;t, I just don&#39;t have the time.</p><p>So it&#39;s the kind of business where you can&#39;t wait to get up in the morning and read the papers, or listen to what&#39;s on the news, and you know, how the world&#39;s going to change.</p><p>The muse holds no appointments. You can never call on it. I don&#39;t understand people who get up at 9 o&#39;clock in the morning, put on the coffee and sit down to write.</p><p>You say something stupid and the next morning you&#39;re in the headlines.</p><p>My ideal is to wake up in the morning and run around the meadow naked.</p><p>Mom and Dad would stay in bed on Sunday morning, but the kids would have to go to church.</p><p>I think I&#39;m a fun flatmate. I&#39;m always cheerful. I go on tour with my band so it&#39;s 12 people on one bus and I feel like I&#39;m the one who&#39;s happy in the morning. I&#39;m not a chaotic person, but I might slack off on doing the dishes from time to time.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be in my car all day. I love getting up in the morning in Venice and walking my dogs down to the cafe to get my tea, and then perhaps going to a bookstore and sitting and reading, then walking to the beach.</p><p>What I do is not some magical, mystical thing. I simply get up in the morning, get to work on time, say my lines, and do the best I can.</p><p>Now I know that that is just the phenomena of eating this way. Most all of my letters say I hit a plateau and then one morning I woke up and the melt had happened.</p><p>I&#39;ll always remember when I bumped into Good Morning America&#39;s Robin Roberts on a flight to my mother&#39;s funeral in 1994, and how kind she was during that difficult time.</p><p>When I found out I was going to be on CBS every morning, my first phone call was to Jenny Craig. Ten days later, I&#39;d lost nine pounds. Now I even take the plan&#39;s popcorn with me to the movies.</p><p>There are 435 members of Congress. There&#39;s one &#39;Morning Joe&#39; show. Hopefully, we can keep hammering the argument that you can disagree with other people and have debates but remain civil.</p><p>I could announce one morning that the world was going to blow up in three hours and people would be calling in about my hair!</p><p>But, you know, they don&#39;t enjoy the dinner hour together. It&#39;s just not as much of a ritual at night and it&#39;s interesting. I think the ritual is taking place perhaps more in the morning.</p><p>But of course when people watch morning television, Terry, it&#39;s a very different animal. You know, they&#39;re running around, they&#39;re getting their kids ready for school, they&#39;re probably doing eight million things, they&#39;re brushing their teeth.</p><p>All three networks have always had a morning show but now cable of course is taking some of that audience away and a variety of other things, probably the Internet as well.</p><p>Well, when I was a kid and I watched &#39;Speed Racer,&#39; I used to always watch it in the morning with my cereal. And when I ate the cereal, I would pour soda into the cereal because we never really had milk for some reason, I don&#39;t know.</p><p>You know what I like to do on a Sunday morning? Clean my house. I really enjoy it it&#39;s my ritual. I require tidiness, actually. I have to have everything spotless before I can relax.</p><p>There would be nights when I would wake up and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep. So I would go downstairs and write. The staff had a pool going on how many pages of typing I would bring in here in the morning.</p><p>There is both a skill factor and an effort factor in dream recall. People can develop dream recall skills, such as lying still in the morning and writing down whatever comes to mind.</p><p>The four of us couldn&#39;t have made a record with the time left over when we were shooting the show. We were on stage from 7.30 in the morning &#39;til 7 at night. Later on, when there was a break from filming, and we were sick of doing it the old way.</p><p>You think that religion is a thing that is there to help you and to see you through life, and then you wake up one morning and find the entire Irish situation, the civil war that&#39;s based on religion.</p><p>Markets rebounded quickly from morning jitters after the London Thursday terrorist bombing.</p><p>I just remember Stella Tenant and me dancing in Donatella Versace&#39;s bathtub until like four in the morning. It was one of those &#39;pinch me&#39; moments.</p><p>I turned on VH1 this morning just to get a little warm-up before I came over here, and I think it&#39;s just terrific. There&#39;s so much great stuff: diverse and wonderful music, good performances, great looking girls, great videos, the whole thing.</p><p>When I read the pilot &#39;for Married with Children&#39;, it just reminded me of my Uncle Joe... just a self-deprecating kind of guy. He&#39;d come home from work, and the wife would maybe say &#39;I ran over the dog this morning in the driveway&#39;. And he would say &#39;Fine, what&#39;s for dinner?</p><p>When I get up in the morning I brush my teeth and go about my business, and if I am going anywhere interesting I take my camera along.</p><p>I love to read. I love to stretch. In the morning, I get up, and if I&#39;m not in a hurry, I will lie on the floor on a rug, look through some books and magazines, and maybe listen to music and try to do stretching exercises to tune up.</p><p>I wake up every morning and I feel like I&#39;m juggling glass balls. I live in Los Angeles, my business is run out of London, and most evenings I&#39;m cuddled up in front of Skype, in my dressing gown, speaking with my studio in London. I travel a lot, my team travel a lot, but I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.</p><p>I made it a morning show. We have the coffee cup, we have the morning papers. It&#39;s got that feel to it, that&#39;s what I wanted.</p><p>I&#39;ve done the best I can with the morning show. I made it a morning show. We have the coffee cup, you have the morning papers, you know, it&#39;s got that feel to it, that&#39;s what I wanted.</p><p>It means a lot in my business and its a wonderful feeling to be recognized for what you have done over a lifetime, but I didn&#39;t go crazy. I still eat my cereal in the morning, have a sandwich in the afternoon, go to bed at night. You know, nothing really different.</p><p>I wake up every morning singing &#39;The Star-Spangled Banner.&#39;</p><p>I&#39;m French, so I&#39;m quite lazy about exercising, and I smoke. But I do love going for a run in the morning with my dog. That&#39;s all.</p><p>I am so excited this year getting to play the 85th Anniversary Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Everyone knows on Thanksgiving morning to get up, turn on the TV and watch the parade, so to be an actual participant is going to be fun and I&#39;m looking forward to it. I am gonna have to put on my deer hunting gear, though, to stay warm!</p><p>We know that a man can read Goethe or Rilke in the evening, that he can play Bach and Schubert, and go to his day&#39;s work at Auschwitz in the morning.</p><p>It was important on The Shipping News to have my house far enough away from each location so I had this time in the morning to think about my shots and still remain open to surprises once I got to the set.</p><p>I didn&#39;t wake up one morning and not be in the Replacements. We&#39;re all that forever, and I&#39;ve just grown older. I mean, I haven&#39;t lost anything. I&#39;ve gained a few things.</p><p>I was up watching Meet Joe Black at four AM. I was hoping Brad Pitt would die, and he was still alive at seven forty in the morning! I actually felt sorry for once, for critics.</p><p>Sometimes it&#39;s so weird just to do an interview. This morning I was back in my parents&#39; house, with my brother, and we went for a jog together, then had breakfast as a family. And a couple of hours later I&#39;m wearing high heels and a dress and makeup, and talking about my job.</p><p>We live under a government of men and morning newspapers.</p><p>Some days I would be there at ten in the morning and wouldn&#39;t leave till ten at night, and the others would waltz in for a couple of hours and then leave, because I was doing that painting thing. And they were happy to see that being done.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t always easy getting up at 5 o&#39;clock in the morning to go to the rink. Sometimes I wanted to just go back to sleep.</p><p>Work is a prayer, and I start off every morning dedicating it to our Creator.</p><p>We had news this morning of another successful atomic bomb being dropped on Nagasaki. These two heavy blows have fallen in quick succession upon the Japanese and there will be quite a little space before we intend to drop another.</p><p>I started writing morning pages just to keep my hand in, you know, just because I was a writer and I didn&#39;t know what else to do but write. And then one day as I was writing, a character came sort of strolling in and I realized, Oh my God, I don&#39;t have to be just a screenwriter. I can write novels.</p><p>I don&#39;t have an iPod. I mean, I have a couple. Doesn&#39;t everyone? But I don&#39;t use it. I need to because I go to the gym now, and I&#39;m tired of listening to morning radio. I want some music! I do have a video iPod, but I don&#39;t use it either.</p><p>I started playing poker in 2003 during my pregnancy, to distract myself from my awful morning sickness. For months all I did was cry and play Texas Hold&#39;em.</p><p>I squeeze oranges every morning to make juice.</p><p>So when bands work with me and it&#39;s 10 o&#39;clock, usually you&#39;d have to be getting out of the studio, we could go on until 2 in the morning cause it&#39;s my place!</p><p>Internet marketing entrepreneurs have truly opened my eyes to just how important a quick turnaround time can be. Often times, an interview they conduct with me today is online by the next morning. The interviewee is then able to start making money less than 24 hours after the initial interview.</p><p>One&#39;s age should be tranquil, as childhood should be playful. Hard work at either extremity of life seems out of place. At midday the sun may burn, and men labor under it but the morning and evening should be alike calm and cheerful.</p><p>You feel a little older in the morning. By noon I feel about 55.</p><p>When I wrote the song, I had the sea near Bombay in mind. We stayed at a hotel by the sea, and the fishermen come up at five in the morning and they were all chanting. And we went on the beach and we got chased by a mad dog - big as a donkey.</p><p>Well physically preparing for the role, definitely and then continuing to stay physically fit throughout filming, getting up, 4.00 4.30 in the morning.</p><p>I got into shape because I took kick-boxing lessons every day to prepare for a fight scene with Taylor Lautner. I really wanted to lie down and eat Chinese food, but I kick-boxed every morning and ran. If someone was filming you with your kit off, you&#39;d do the same thing.</p><p>He would use amphetamines to stay awake because he would have late night maneuvers that would go way into the early morning hours and he was given pills to stay up for the long hours.</p><p>Because my parents, growing up, they worked hard. Everyone in my family woke up early in the morning. I used to see my mother and my father go off to work, and come back and, no matter what, they had time for the kids.</p><p>In the morning, I reach for the sports page.</p><p>On my morning run, I listen to sports talk radio.</p><p>I can&#39;t record in the morning because I sound like Barry White.</p><p>Bagel in the morning is the ultimate breakfast for me they&#39;re just good.</p><p>I can write all the way through the morning, when my mind is clear, and there are no distractions.</p><p>I was half asleep lying there writing this lyric in my head at about 3:30 in the morning.

I wonder where that piano is now?</p><p>Men and women were declared equal one morning and everybody could divorce each other by postcard.</p><p>I had a friend whose family had dinner together.

It came into my head unbidden.</p><p>My poor vision gives me a soft-focus morning. For the first half hour, I kind of wander through my house, and everything is a blur. I put my contacts in when I&#39;m ready to deal with the world.</p><p>We all deal with issues of time. The first thing you do in the morning is look at the clock to see what time it is.</p><p>I got up one Christmas morning and we didn&#39;t have nothing to eat. We didn&#39;t have an apple, we didn&#39;t have an orange, we didn&#39;t have a cake, we didn&#39;t have nothing.</p><p>And now the momentous day, a day to be forever remembered in the annals of the country, arrived. Early in the morning on the 1st of July the conflict began.</p><p>Holiday? Is like, what? I&#39;m a hyperactive girl, so it may be boring for me to be on the beach doing nothing. I just need to find a place for three weeks and work but sleep in the morning, maybe write a little bit, have a glass of red wine.

Only to find out moments later that, in fact, there had been an off-site release. I still haven&#39;t gotten over that.</p><p>I was scheduled to give my first official press conference that morning anyway, &#39;cause I was chairman of the Governors Energy Council and I was making a press conference with regard to energy policy.</p><p>And at ten, or whatever time, in the morning we had the press conference, what we knew is there had been an incident at Three Mile Island, that it was shut down, that there was water that had escaped but it was contained.</p><p>I have got up at truly deplorable hours in the morning to confront Vancouver&#39;s Jack Webster on television because I have been told that is the place to get exposure for ideas.</p><p>The morning after my high-school graduation found me up early job hunting.

But the women who do run are usually 10 years younger than me and they&#39;re really obsessed about running. That&#39;s all they do. They&#39;re really boring.</p><p>Nothing is better than waking up in the morning and being excited to go into work.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies are enjoying unprecedented profits and access with this Administration. Yet the Republicans&#39; prescription drug plan for seniors has been a colossal failure, and over 43 million Americans wake up every morning without health insurance.</p><p>From 7 in the morning to 11 at night, I was reading. I don&#39;t think one can find any other time in one&#39;s life to be left alone so much to read in peace like that.</p><p>It really means a lot that I won the gold medal - but I woke up the next morning expecting to feel different. I felt the same.</p><p>I often write either really early in the morning, or really late at night.</p><p>Do I believe in arbitration? I do. But not in arbitration between the lion and the lamb, in which the lamb is in the morning found inside the lion.</p><p>I feel a lot healthier when I&#39;m having sex. Physically. I feel all these jitters when I wake up in the morning. Just energy jitters. I take vitamins, I work out every day. When I&#39;m having sex, I don&#39;t have that.</p><p>I took prenatal yoga three times a week, including the morning I went into labor. It helped me stay comfortable.</p><p>I write in the morning from about eight till noon, and sometimes again a bit in the afternoon. In the morning I start off by going over what I had done the previous day, which my wife has happily typed up for me.</p><p>To this day, I hate walnuts and I hate onions because on weekends when the walnuts and onions were in season, we were out there first thing in the morning and out there until the sun went down topping onions or picking walnuts.</p><p>If I&#39;m coming in at 4:00 in the morning and my kids have been in bed since 8:00, 9:00, that&#39;s not setting a good example. The responsibility that I have kids inside my household has made me realize now that I have to be an example.</p><p>I had no occasion for an apron on that morning.</p><p>In New York, I like it when you can get bagels at 3 in the morning.</p><p>I sit down at my desk pretty early in the morning and write all day until about 4 or 5 p.m.</p><p>My wife gets pampered pretty well. She&#39;s had me trained since she was pregnant, when I started making her oatmeal with fresh berries every morning.</p><p>My host at Richmond, yesterday morning, could not sufficiently express his surprise that I intended to venture to walk as far as Oxford, and still farther. He however was so kind as to send his son, a clever little boy, to show me the road leading to Windsor.</p><p>Another challenge? Getting up at 6:30 in the morning to go act.

I had forgotten I was free.</p><p>I love Adele, I want her to be my best friend. She could come to the U.S., live with me and sing to me every morning.</p><p>I get up at sunrise.

I took a very different approach than most reporters. I approached it more casually than you would think a reporter would. Now I&#39;m a morning radio personality, and radio is really casual.</p><p>Early on the next morning we reached Kansas, about five hundred miles from the mouth of the Missouri.</p><p>Four men are missing R., Sorel and two emigrants. They set out this morning after buffalo, and have not yet made their appearance whether killed or lost, we cannot tell.</p><p>I remember being at school during morning meeting and looking around at everybody, 350 kids, saying a prayer.

I&#39;ll never be a frustrated athlete.</p><p>I like everything perfect. Everything has to be neat. My sister is 5, and she&#39;s more messy than I am.

I cut out a dress for one of the women.</p><p>I know a lot of people dread going to work every morning, but my work is playing pretend and doing stunts and screaming.

I couldn&#39;t be more grateful.</p><p>I woke up one morning with this song in my head, and the opening line of the song is, &#39;My name was Richard Nixon, only now I&#39;m a girl.&#39;</p><p>Sometimes I miss out the morning&#39;s painting session and instead study my Japanese books in the open.</p><p>There is nothing that special to see when looking at me. I&#39;m a painter who paints day in day out, from morning till evening - figure pictures and landscapes, more rarely portraits.</p><p>Ice skating is very difficult. It takes a lot of discipline and a lot of hard work. It&#39;s fun, but you are there on the ice every morning freezing and trying to do these moves and these tricks.</p><p>I was lucky because on the morning after the burning of the Reichstag I left my home very early to catch a train to Berlin for the conference of our student organization and that is the only reason why I escaped arrest.</p><p>Work is a prayer.

You know, he&#39;s six-and-a-half and so a big chunk of the day is taken up by school.

We have matching colour jackets.</p><p>I need to eat before a workout. If I exercise in the morning, I&#39;ll have a little oatmeal, cereal, or a hard-boiled egg with toast. If I go in the afternoon, I&#39;ll eat a turkey sandwich with cheese for lunch.</p><p>Every morning I wake up with new ideas.</p><p>We usually never got out of there before four or five o&#39;clock in the morning. Every morning. So it was rough.</p><p>My first care the following morning was, to devise some means of discovering the man in the grey cloak.</p><p>I looked at films as a career from necessity but all I have really wanted is my home and children. The two things just do not work out together when one has to leave home at 5.30 am in the morning to go to the studio.</p><p>We also own a little boat and I&#39;m like a kid with it. I take off early in the morning, fishing rod in tow, and just drift about the ocean all day.</p><p>All we had aboard the ship that morning was one Annapolis graduate and three reserves.</p><p>It&#39;s very much like opera singers.

I still get up every morning and go to work.</p><p>I get up at an unholy hour in the morning my work day is completed by the time the sun rises. I have a slightly bad back which has made an enormous contribution to American literature.</p><p>It was so quiet that morning in Paris that the heels of my two companions and myself were loud on the deserted pavements. It was a city of shuttered shops, and barred windows, and deserted avenues.</p><p>I met my boyfriend, a pro poker player, at a tournament. He tried to dissuade me because it&#39;s a seedy gritty world. Listen, I&#39;ve played till 4 in the morning. I&#39;ve played with a half million dollars on the table.</p><p>Looking in the mirror to check if my tie is straight is a waste of my time. I only look in the mirror once a day, and that&#39;s in the morning when I shave.</p><p>It was not enough to come and listen to a great sermon or message every Sunday morning and be confined to those four walls and those four corners. You had to get out and do something.</p><p>I love my daughter, but she had me on couscous and fixed me pastas and made me eat oatmeal every morning and what else, turkey burgers, turkey bacon, and that kind of stuff. So she wants her dad to live a long time, and I do, too.</p><p>The plane took off at 8:10 in the morning - or that&#39;s when it was scheduled to take off. And that&#39;s when I believe it took off.

That&#39;s how it goes.</p><p>I doing casual labor by the day. They wouldn&#39;t pay you until the next morning. There was a bar that would cash your check if you bought a beer first. A lot of guys never left until they&#39;d drunk up all their money.</p><p>Politics gets me out of bed in the morning It&#39;s what really interests me. I&#39;m a competitor, but I also feel like I&#39;m contributing, whether it&#39;s working on health-care policy in the White House or out here in Chicago.</p><p>I don&#39;t know any other lifestyle.

I couldn&#39;t wait until it was over so I could sleep in. In college, I made sure all my classes were in the afternoon. I hated getting up in the morning.</p><p>I get up in the morning, do my e-mail, I check my e-mails all day. I&#39;ll go online and I&#39;ll buy my books at Amazon.com, but I don&#39;t want to buy all of them because I want to go to Duttons and I want to buy books from another human being.</p><p>I have asked myself once or twice lately what was my natural bent. I have no doubt at all: It is to look at each day for the evil of that day and have a go at it, and that is why I have never failed to have an acute interest in each morning&#39;s letters.</p><p>I&#39;d wake up in the morning and I would think, &#39;Where am I?&#39; I&#39;d have to gather myself.</p><p>I wake up every morning feeling lucky - which is driven by fear, no doubt, since I know it could all go away.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t wear paint this morning.

I have to go find a missing person.&#39;</p><p>In this respect early youth is exactly like old age it is a time of waiting for a big trip to an unknown destination. The chief difference is that youth waits for the morning limited and age waits for the night train.</p><p>The present moment is nice but it does not last. Living in it is like waiting in a junction town for the morning limited the junction may be interesting but some day you will have to leave it and you do not know where the limited will take you.</p><p>I just enjoy life now. I just enjoy every morning I get to wake up.</p><p>Four hours of makeup, and then an hour to take it off. It&#39;s tiring. I go in, I get picked up at two-thirty in the morning, I get there at three. I wait four hours, go through it, ready to work at seven, work all day long for twelve hours, and get it taken off for an hours, go home and go to sleep, and do the same thing again.</p><p>The reasons why I left were to do with my interest in Buddhism. There were experiences over a period of about six months which caused me to decide to give up music, so one morning I felt I had to go to E.G.

I was aroused by the cry that the enemy was upon us.</p><p>In Rio Bravo when Duke makes love to Feathers, the scene dissolves to the next morning where we see him putting on his vest and almost humming. It was subtle, but you knew what happened. Give me a towel and some blankets any day!</p><p>Change is tough, people don&#39;t like it, but it is necessary. Take two aspirins and call me in the morning.</p><p>I like freedom. I wake up in the morning and say, &#39;I don&#39;t know, should I have a popsicle or a donut?&#39; You know, who knows?</p><p>On tour, I&#39;ll get up at 5 p.m. and go to bed at 8 in the morning. With fishing, it&#39;s the exact opposite. Fishing is the only healthy thing I do. Touring is such a grind it&#39;s the opposite of healthy.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know that I could do a talk show. I didn&#39;t know that we could bring variety to daytime. I didn&#39;t know that people wanted to see singing, and dancing and comedy in the morning.</p><p>That was my childhood. I grew up with the monks, studying Sanskrit and meditating for hours in the morning and hours in the evening, and going once a day to beg for food.</p><p>I could wake up six in the morning, go downstairs and record. I learned how to use ProTools and everything. Whenever I felt it, I could record.</p><p>Before I go to bed at night, I ice my face, because it closes your pores and makes a difference in the morning.</p><p>Everybody&#39;s after a new morning. What do we have to run up and salute tomorrow?</p><p>I was the first in my peer group to get pregnant. All I craved was reassurance.

I would get to the office at 6:30 a.m. and write until other people arrived, around 9. Now I still do that. I start at 6:30 or 7, and I&#39;ll write until 11, then take an hour off, then work until about 2 p.m. By then my brain has had enough.</p><p>I used to hear about guys who played saying how difficult it is getting up in the morning, and now I&#39;m experiencing it those same effects.</p><p>The newspaper is a marvelous medium. It is extraordinarily convenient and cheap. Let&#39;s see. This one cost 75 cents. Now that&#39;s a little high. I bought it when I was downtown this morning.</p><p>The 6th of August in the morning we saw an opening in the land and we ran into it, and anchored in 7 and a half fathom water, 2 miles from the shore, clean sand.</p><p>Well, he doesn&#39;t make me laugh. I think I&#39;ve got a fair sense of humour but I can&#39;t really see it in him. I&#39;ve listened to his show on the radio on a Saturday morning, and that&#39;s a load of mince as well.</p><p>Maxi dresses are also my best friend. They take me from my morning coffee, to the beach, to nighttime.</p><p>At the end of the day, I don&#39;t need to work, and I think it&#39;s good that I have the drive and willpower to get up and do something in the morning even though I don&#39;t need to.</p><p>How did we suddenly become entranced with gangster culture? I saw it this morning on campus. When did the black community say we should all look like criminals?</p><p>I&#39;m a total protein shake junkie nerd. I get creative every morning - you never know what you&#39;re gonna get in my shake... fruit? Peanut butter? Ice-cream?</p><p>I love to be in my bathroom with my candles lit, morning, noon and night. I like taking hot baths and hot showers, using my body scrubs and lotions.</p><p>Always get married in the morning. That way if it doesn&#39;t work out, you haven&#39;t wasted the whole day.</p><p>Our systems are all go. At 9:30 Monday morning trading will resume on both markets, and the message will be given to criminals who foisted this on America that they lost.</p><p>If I&#39;m on location on some island, we usually get up at four in the morning to set up. By seven thirty, we&#39;re on the beach working until noon, then we rest. It&#39;s not exactly a vacation.</p><p>When I get the morning report on security, I call those battalions in the regions where there are problems.</p><p>Running clears my mind, and gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning.</p><p>I like to wake up each morning feeling a new man.</p><p>I&#39;m pretty much a 9-to-5 kind of guy. I usually get to work about 8 in the morning, and I work until 4 or 5, and sometimes I work on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Pretty much I keep the same hours as an accountant or clerk or whatever.</p><p>Man, if I made one million dollars I would come in at six in the morning, sweep the stands, wash the uniforms, clean out the office, manage the team and play the games.</p><p>You have to wake up a virgin each morning.</p><p>For 50 years, acting was the reason I got up in the morning.</p><p>You can be in Tokyo or Alberta at four in the morning in your hotel and you can still practice if you feel like it. A trombone cannot do that at four in the morning.</p><p>Remember that God under the Law ordained a Lamb to be offered up to Him every Morning and Evening.</p><p>The cool thing about writing is that there is really never a typical day. Sometimes I get a rhythm going and head off to work every morning and come home at night. Sometimes I&#39;ll write for two days straight and then be utterly blank for the next two.</p><p>That&#39;s what keeps me up at three in the morning: Who&#39;s looking at reviews of Cabin Boy right now?</p><p>I think it&#39;s probably best to work out in the morning to get it out of the way. My ultimate top tip is to drag yourself, even if you have to roll yourself out of your bed and in to a sit-up - it&#39;s really not that bad once you start.</p><p>The sound of the blades on the ice in the morning is like smelling fresh coffee.</p><p>New Orleans life is such a night life. The thing that comes up very often is that our day essentially doesn&#39;t start until midnight or 2 in the morning.</p><p>I like to eat yogurt in the morning. It&#39;s easy and quick and available anywhere.</p><p>I have a huge breakfast every morning because I never know if I&#39;ll have time for lunch, especially during Fashion Week. It keeps my mood positive all day. And my parents taught me to have tons of fruit and vegetables, which I think helps my skin.</p><p>I&#39;m not really a morning person.</p><p>Another thing that&#39;s quite different in writing a book as a practicing newspaperman is that if you look at what you&#39;ve written the next morning and you think you didn&#39;t get it quite right, you can fix it.</p><p>It&#39;s a miserable life in Hollywood. You&#39;re up at five or six o&#39;clock in the morning to be ready to start shooting at nine.</p><p>I went to Morocco, joined a band called Pegasus, ran out of money, went to Gibraltar and worked on the docks, writing songs about the sun and the morning and the birds.</p><p>For the first-time novelist you&#39;ve got to get up at 5:30 in the morning and write until 7, make breakfast and go to work.

Everybody has an hour in their day somewhere.</p><p>The next morning we saw nothing of the enemy, though we were still lying to.</p><p>In a still hot morning, the tide went out and didn&#39;t come back in. This was not a spectacular event. The sea did not roll up like a scroll, like the sky in Revelations. It quietly withdrew.</p><p>My aunt had a season ticket for the Friday afternoon concerts, and I would go down for lessons. My lessons were Saturday morning.</p><p>In a few days an officer came to our camp, under a flag of truce, and informed Hamilton, then a captain of artillery, but afterwards the aid of General Washington, that Captain Hale had been arrested within the British lines condemned as a spy, and executed that morning.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t much signify whom one marries, for one is sure to find next morning that it was someone else.</p><p>So far as I know, anything worth hearing is not usually uttered at seven o&#39;clock in the morning and if it is, it will generally be repeated at a more reasonable hour for a larger and more wakeful audience.</p><p>I opened the large central window of my office room to its full on the fine early May morning. Then I stood for a few moments, breathing in the soft, warm air that was charged with the scent of white lilacs below.</p><p>I work out twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed. I&#39;ll start with half an hour of running and then some yoga to stretch everything out so everything is warm.</p><p>I&#39;m still going to do television. I&#39;m just not going to do morning television. I would like to do some things that satisfy interests, private interests.</p><p>I write in the morning, I walk in the afternoon and I read in the evening. It&#39;s a very easy, lovely life.</p><p>He&#39;s got an overall flair for the game. It looks to me like he really loves what he does and he can&#39;t wait to get up in the morning, go hit some balls and go play.</p><p>I woke up on the plane this morning and was turning on my phone and I had to put my pin number in. That&#39;s when I realized that since the age of 10 I&#39;ve been using 2012 as my pin number. But now that I&#39;ve won gold in the 2012 Olympics, I&#39;ve achieved that goal and, for the first time in 14 years, I&#39;ll have to change my pin.</p><p>I spent many a summer early morning with the radio very low, half sleeping and half listening.</p><p>In the morning on Sunday, a drum is sounded at about 8 o&#39;clock.</p><p>Well, I get my subject on Wednesday night I think it out carefully on Thursday, and make my rough sketch on Friday morning I begin, and stick to it all day, with my nose well down on the block.</p><p>This enraged the other Nazi so much that the next morning he came to our house and he shot my father.</p><p>Early One Morning takes time and, I mean, all things like that I felt were very important.</p><p>If I don&#39;t fish in the morning, I fish in the evening.</p><p>Suddenly a single shot on the extreme left rang out on the clear morning air, followed quickly by several others, and the whole line pushed rapidly forward through the brush.</p><p>When I was twelve, I went hunting with my father and we shot a bird.

Gone are the days when drivers show up Friday morning and go home Sunday night. We&#39;re all integral to our partnerships, commercially, motorsports.

It may seem even fresher.</p><p>Movies are something people see all over the world because there is a certain need for it.</p><p>Movies are an art form that is very available to the masses.</p><p>Movies are a complicated collision of literature, theatre, music and all the visual arts.</p><p>Every single art form is involved in film, in a way.</p><p>When you make a film you usually make a film about an idea.</p><p>I was obsessed with romance. When I was in high school, I saw &#39;Doctor Zhivago&#39; every day from the day it opened until the day it left the theater.</p><p>And in movies you must be a gambler. To produce films is to gamble.</p><p>Movies are not scripts - movies are films they&#39;re not books, they&#39;re not the theatre.</p><p>I just like movies that somehow expose the world in a way that&#39;s different than you imagine it.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been an animal lover. I&#39;ve grown up with dogs my whole life. I think that is what helped me get the role on &#39;Lassie&#39;, I was comfortable around the dog, where many of the kids were afraid or intimidated by Lassie.</p><p>Sometimes in movies, I still have to be the hero, but it&#39;s not all that important to me anymore.</p><p>Nobody makes movies bad on purpose.</p><p>Home Alone&#39; was a movie, not an alibi.;Jerry Orbach;movies 49192;It couldn&#39;t sound like a dog, because K9 isn&#39;t a dog, but I made it sound as mechanical as possible.;John Leeson;movies 49193;We are the movies and the movies are us.;David Ansen;movies 49194;Everything I learned I learned from the movies.;Audrey Hepburn;movies 49195;Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I&#39;d sit all day and way into the night.

But I also know it has an idea that I&#39;ll like because that idea occurred to me, and I spent a year, or a year and a half of my life working on it.;Stephen King;movies 49209;Somebody asked me about the current choice we&#39;re being given in the presidential election.

I&#39;m attracted to this genre and that genre, this type of story, and that type of story. As I watch movies I make some version of it in my head that isn&#39;t quite what I&#39;m seeing - taking the things I like and mixing them with stuff I&#39;ve never seen before.;Quentin Tarantino;movies 49226;Some mornings you wake up and think, gee I look handsome today.

It&#39;s, it&#39;s, I don&#39;t know, but Faye Dunaway comes up a lot in that thinking. It&#39;s the subtlety of sexiness.

But I&#39;ll never be an actor.</p><p>My dream role would probably be a psycho killer, because the whole thing I love about movies is that you get to do things you could never do in real life, and that would be my way of vicariously experiencing being a psycho killer. Also, it&#39;s incredibly romantic.</p><p>In life and in movies, it&#39;s a similar challenge, where you have expectations, and you end up in situations that are not meeting your expectations.</p><p>Sex is a doorway to something so powerful and mystical, but movies usually depict it in a completely flat way.</p><p>Right now, my job is that I&#39;m like an ambulance chaser. I&#39;ve got to look for movies with white guys falling out of them.</p><p>Movies have takes. But plays are like life - you don&#39;t really get takes.</p><p>Dude, I didn&#39;t say Jude Law can&#39;t act. I didn&#39;t say Jude Law was in bad movies. I just said he&#39;s in every movie.</p><p>My movies are okay, but they&#39;re not my specials.</p><p>I&#39;m not bragging but my movies have grossed well over a billion dollars.</p><p>I&#39;m obsessed with zombies. I like watching zombie movies and I read zombie books.</p><p>Not only do I have to live, right, I have to get some cash for my troubles - it&#39;s a scary thing, and people need to start to think about the messages that they send in the movies.</p><p>Movies are like magic tricks.</p><p>I&#39;d maybe done about 12 movies when I decided that this was what I was going to do.</p><p>I&#39;m used to watching old movies of myself.</p><p>Movies are very subjective.</p><p>Normally, I love to go to the movies and when I see a character portrayed by different actors at different ages, it kind of pops a little bit for me. It brings me out of the movie experience. Now we have the technology to cure that.</p><p>I&#39;m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it&#39;s one of the great things about making movies is it&#39;s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character&#39;s costume and what that might tell about your character.</p><p>I think there&#39;s a real joy in going to see movies when you discover them yourself.</p><p>Nowadays it seems more and more like the &#39;business&#39; in &#39;show business&#39; is underlined, and there are campaigns, and it&#39;s all part of getting people in to see the movies.</p><p>Even in India the Hindi film industry might be the best known but there are movies made in other regional languages in India, be it Tamil or Bengali. Those experiences too are different from the ones in Bombay.</p><p>I remember being on film sets when I was younger, and only men got to do the cool action movies. So I thought, &#39;Maybe I&#39;ll get to produce one day and get to do cool stuff too,&#39; which is what happened when we did &#39;Charlie&#39;s Angels.&#39; Starting my production company was a big turning point for me.</p><p>Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn&#39;t normal. I didn&#39;t have to go to school, so I didn&#39;t. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I&#39;m almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I&#39;m crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.</p><p>I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that&#39;s a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.</p><p>You know, I think the film business is its own worst enemy because it sells movies on DVD footage and &#39;behind the scenes,&#39; and now it&#39;s a real struggle trying to keep storylines and plotlines a secret.</p><p>Later on they send me to Hollywood. To make movies. It was all new to me. I was only 21 years old.</p><p>The next thing I knew, I was out of the service and making movies again. My first picture was called, GI Blues. I thought I was still in the army.</p><p>If there&#39;s specific resistance to women making movies, I just choose to ignore that as an obstacle for two reasons: I can&#39;t change my gender, and I refuse to stop making movies.</p><p>Everyone related to me in my circle was from church: church friends, church school, church activities. All my friends weren&#39;t allowed to watch MTV or go to PG-13 movies or listen to the radio, so I didn&#39;t really know anything different. That&#39;s how I was raised.</p><p>My whole life has been movies and religion. That&#39;s it. Nothing else.</p><p>Very often I&#39;ve known people who wouldn&#39;t say a word to each other, but they&#39;d go to see movies together and experience life that way.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen many, many movies over the years, and there are only a few that suddenly inspire you so much that you want to continue to make films.</p><p>I think less is more when it comes to kissing in the movies.</p><p>I&#39;m doing &#39;Les Miserables,&#39; the movie. I&#39;ve done a lot of musicals and a lot of movies, and I know there are not a lot of people in Hollywood who have been down those two paths so I&#39;ve been like, &#39;Come on, let&#39;s do a movie/musical.&#39;</p><p>I have done many movies that people hadn&#39;t seen. &#39;The Fountain,&#39; I spent a year on that. &#39;The Prestige&#39; with Chris Nolan, and &#39;Australia.&#39; From my perspective it&#39;s very satisfying. Some movies people see and other movies they don&#39;t. &#39;Wolverine,&#39; &#39;X Men,&#39; I know that in some level people know me just for that and it&#39;s fine for me.</p><p>The best movies are simple.</p><p>Nobody makes movies like Oliver Stone.</p><p>I&#39;m not a strikingly handsome guy, but I&#39;m in movies.</p><p>I was always raised on cowboy films, and then when I could start making choices about the movies I wanted to watch I found myself wanting to watch gangster films which were slightly more sophisticated than the baseline stuff that was in westerns.</p><p>Basically, there&#39;s not enough sex in movies, that&#39;s it. I&#39;m trying to say it, people. I miss sex in movies because sex is natural, guns are not.</p><p>You know those movies where the people in the audience are screaming, &#39;Don&#39;t go in that door!&#39; because you know the killer is there? Well, it is the same thing with this debt. We know how this ends.</p><p>I sure lost my musical direction in Hollywood. My songs were the same conveyer belt mass production, just like most of my movies were.</p><p>Those movies sure got me into a rut.</p><p>Too much TV hurts movies.</p><p>Funny things happen to you in movies for silly reasons.</p><p>January is the garbage can of movies in America, directly after all the Oscar contenders have been out.</p><p>My wife comes with me on all the movies, but she is not an appendage to a film star or anything like that. She is a completely intertwined partner. She is the other half of me. Also, we&#39;re still very much in love with each other. We always have been, we always will be.</p><p>My mother had to send me to the movies with my birth certificate, so that I wouldn&#39;t have to pay the extra fifty cents that the adults had to pay.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what it was, maybe the movie theaters in my immediate surrounding neighbourhood in Burbank, but I never saw what would be considered A movies.</p><p>I never really got nightmares from movies. In fact, I recall my father saying when I was three years old that I would be scared, but I never was.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to criticize any other designers, but I have to say that many of the people involved in this industry - directors and producers - are trying to make their games more like movies. They are longing to make movies rather than making videogames.</p><p>Even the worst Bond movies, there&#39;s something to love about them.</p><p>I see a lot of movies. I love films as a spectator, and that&#39;s never obscured by the part of me that does the work myself. I just love going to the movies.</p><p>Where I come from, it was a heresy to say you wanted to be in movies, leave alone American movies.</p><p>My children have never watched any of my films. Charlie knows that daddy makes movies, but he says they are not good enough for him to watch.</p><p>I&#39;m not an admirer of action movies. I just think, Oh my God, it must be so tiring.</p><p>How do people relate to movies now, when they&#39;re on portable devices or streaming them? It&#39;s not as much about going to the movies. That experience has changed.</p><p>Economically, it&#39;s more expensive to make movies. I hope digital movies change that.</p><p>In life, single women are the most vulnerable adults. In movies, they are given imaginary power.</p><p>I still like the run and gun action movies and how truly dangerous it can be to make these films.</p><p>When I was a little boy I used to borrow my father&#39;s hat, and make a press card to stick in the hat band. That was the way reporters were always portrayed in the movies.</p><p>Frankly, I got into the movies because I like the movies a lot.</p><p>I really don&#39;t have favorites I&#39;m just a fan of movies, period.</p><p>Hollywood is throwing action movies at me.</p><p>I had done some flimflam movies, but I didn&#39;t understand what being an actor meant anymore.</p><p>Before &#39;Schindler&#39;s List,&#39; I wouldn&#39;t have believed movies had a lot of power for social change.</p><p>A lot of the struggle I had with movies is I really loved moments and tones and feelings in a scene, and I loved creating those, but I never really had great stories to string them together.</p><p>You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phoney stuff in the movies, and nine times out of ten they&#39;re mean bastards at heart.</p><p>Sure, &#39;Twilight&#39; is really huge right now and everybody&#39;s freaking out over it, but it will go away soon and I will be back to doing what I&#39;m used to doing: weird little movies that nobody sees.</p><p>I go to the movies a lot, and I regret when I see some actor that I used to like, to find them offering no more surprises.</p><p>I live very normally, I go out with my friends, we go to the movies, I queue, we go to restaurants.</p><p>Bruce Lee was very famous. I watched his movies and he is amazing. He is a martial arts master, his philosophy, his movement, both physically and mentally, were very strong.</p><p>When we talk about how movies used to be made, it was over 100 years of film, literal, physical film, with emulsion, that we would expose to light and we would get pictures.</p><p>The whole world loves American movies, blue jeans, jazz and rock and roll. It is probably a better way to get to know our country than by what politicians or airline commercials represent.</p><p>In the past I&#39;ve made movies that were pretty universally liked. You can&#39;t really hate them. You can discard them, but you can&#39;t really hate them.</p><p>I look at American movies, the big muscles, and try to apply that to Chinese film-making.</p><p>I have a lot of repression. So repression is what I make movies about.</p><p>I think a lot of people do big movies not because they are talented artists but because they can function in the circumstances.</p><p>Thinking back to those earlier days, I felt I was weak when I wasn&#39;t making movies, and then when I was, I thought I was weak as a family member.</p><p>Making movies is a way of understanding myself and the world.</p><p>After making several tragic movies in a row, I was looking to do a comedy, and one without cynicism.</p><p>3D is quite a lot more advanced in animated movies for live-action movies we&#39;re just taking baby steps, we&#39;re just in the beginning.</p><p>I have a very busy life, and not many people who have a career and four kids go out a lot to the movies.</p><p>I knew that there were black people in Africa, of course, unfortunately because of movies such as &#39;Tarzan.&#39;</p><p>My family and our neighbors and friends thought of Africa and its Africans as extensions of the stereotyped characters that we saw in movies and on television in films such as &#39;Tarzan&#39; and in programs such as &#39;Ramar of the Jungle&#39; and &#39;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.&#39;</p><p>I like to hang out with my friends. I love music. I like to go to the movies. I like to eat. I like to cook.</p><p>I think that&#39;s what distinguishes Schmidt, really. In the movies now, so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction, and Schmidt is simply human. There&#39;s no melodrama there&#39;s no device, It&#39;s just about a human being.</p><p>Movies make you immortal and ageless.</p><p>I grew up watching all these crazy movies, European movies and stuff, and I guess that I always laughed at things that were a little more offbeat.</p><p>I don&#39;t like comedy. I like funny things. I don&#39;t like comedy. Like, comedy movies are just, &#39;Oh Jesus.&#39;</p><p>For me the greatest source of income is still movies. Nothing - stocks, financial speculation, real estate speculation or businesses - makes more money for me than making movies.</p><p>I will make action movies, I think, for a few more years, another five years.</p><p>Sometimes when we weep in the movies we weep for ourselves or for a life unlived. Or we even go to the movies because we want to resist the emotion that&#39;s there in front of us. I think there is always a catharsis that I look for and that makes the movie experience worthwhile.</p><p>If people are constantly reading about you, and you&#39;re overexposed, they&#39;ve got no reason to go see your movies. Also, it&#39;s not pleasant or nice to have your privacy invaded.</p><p>I think it&#39;s better to be involved in one or two movies a year.</p><p>They say I can open movies, and that&#39;s nice in that it puts into people&#39;s minds that women can do it. It&#39;s not just Kevin Costner, not just Arnold Schwarzenegger. Not just the guys.</p><p>Making movies is not rocket science. It&#39;s about relationships and communication and strangers coming together to see if they can get along harmoniously, productively, and creatively. That&#39;s a challenge. When it works, it&#39;s fantastic and will lift you up. When it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s almost just as fascinating.</p><p>I&#39;ve made so many movies playing a hooker that they don&#39;t pay me in the regular way anymore. They leave it on the dresser.</p><p>And what I like about it is it makes me happy and I think it makes a lot of people happy to go to the movies and to not think about the problems of the day or the problems of tomorrow or the yesterday and just go on for the ride and have the fun of losing oneself in a fantasy.</p><p>Now on Friday nights, if I want to go hang out with friends, I go hang out with friends. If I want to stay in and be in the hot tub and have people over to watch movies, I do that.</p><p>I&#39;ve had some movies that have been ridiculed, but that&#39;s OK with me. I don&#39;t feel that really defines me. Should I change who I am to be popular?</p><p>I wasn&#39;t allowed to go to movies when I was kid my father was a minister. 101 Dalmatians and King of Kings, that was the extent of it.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to make movies for kids, and I don&#39;t want to make movies for adults either.</p><p>Robots have a rich and storied history in movies.</p><p>What people adore about superhero movies is the signal quality of the Christopher Nolan films - their complete lack of irony when it comes to the portrayal of heroism and the need for heroes to confront evil.</p><p>Well, everyone likes movies when they&#39;re a little kid.</p><p>I made two movies before The Police had a hit record: I did Quadrophenia and a film called Radio On.</p><p>I have realized that I hate going to the premieres of the movies that I&#39;m in. Because I feel this tension after the movie is over that everyone feels obligated to say something nice to you. It&#39;s so unnatural and uncomfortable.</p><p>I do love the films I&#39;ve done in the past. I work hard in my movies and my friends work hard and we&#39;re trying to make people laugh and I&#39;m very proud of that.</p><p>I played Winnie Cooper on &#39;The Wonder Years&#39; from ages 12-18, and did a few other movies during some of the summers.</p><p>I used to love to go to the movies - I&#39;d see two in a row. A few times I even snuck into the second movie after it started... now that I think about it, that&#39;s kind of like shoplifting! Needless to say, I still love going to the movies, but I don&#39;t sneak in anymore.</p><p>Even when I was a little kid, I always said I would be in the movies one day, and damned if I didn&#39;t make it.</p><p>I really like children to watch my movies.</p><p>I&#39;ve choreographed all of my movies.</p><p>When I got depressed, I watched Bruce Lee movies. I learned everything from Bruce Lee.</p><p>Most of the time it&#39;s the role. Sometimes it&#39;s the story and sometimes it just the paycheck. It&#39;s the little movies that come out as stories or the fact that I have work to go out, you know what I&#39;m saying, you can only be out so long without work, you start getting antsy.</p><p>It can have an enormous effect because big budget movies can have big budget perks, and small budget movies have no perks, but what is the driving force, of course, is the script, and your part in it.</p><p>People need to start to think about the messages that they send in the movies.</p><p>Any time you stop looking at evil as a black and white thing, it&#39;s helpful. So the fact that there won&#39;t be any obligatory Islamic terrorist stereotypes in movies any more, that&#39;d be helpful.</p><p>The movies I made early on may not have been great, but they were all commercially successful.</p><p>Movies such as &#39;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&#39; in 1939 to &#39;Dave&#39; in 1993 portray Washington leaders as the ultimate Everymen - decent people just like you and me, only thrust onto greatness.</p><p>I do not quote my own movies. I think I would be pretty insufferable if I did.</p><p>People don&#39;t have these tidy little redemption arcs in reality the way they do in movies.</p><p>I&#39;m not an especially highbrow person, but I have always loved small, quirky, edgy movies.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;ve always been a sucker for roller coasters in movies.</p><p>Oh, I adored Mickey Mouse when I was a child. He was the emblem of happiness and funniness. You went to the movies then, you saw two movies and a short. When Mickey Mouse came on the screen and there was his big head, my sister said she had to hold onto me. I went berserk.</p><p>Going to the movies was a big event in my youth. My father would be the initiator - he&#39;d have me put on a jacket to see a film.</p><p>You can&#39;t work in the movies. Movies are all about lighting. Very few filmmakers will concentrate on the story. You get very little rehearsal time, so anything you do onscreen is a kind of speed painting.</p><p>I like very much to do movies.</p><p>I like to direct movies, but I don&#39;t like to goof around for eight years talking about it.</p><p>Quite often - a lot of the work I had done had been extensively with women. Most especially in the theater, but also quite often in the movies. That has its own delights, and maybe pitfalls too.</p><p>You have to read scripts and audition and develop relationships. It takes a long time to develop a body of work but over the last 25 years I guess I&#39;ve done that many movies. In hindsight it may seem effortless, but there&#39;s a lot of work that goes into it.</p><p>More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services - from movies to agriculture to national defense.</p><p>Steven Spielberg is unique. I feel that the kinds of movies he loves are the same kinds of movies that the big mass audience loves. He&#39;s very fortunate because he can do the things he naturally likes the best, and he&#39;s been very successful.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/quotes/edit/main/src/guide/My guess.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Michael%20Jordan.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Michael Jordan</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/my%20ways%20are.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>my ways are</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
