over.</p><p>---003---</p><p>Many years have passed, people say that the old things can be buried, but I finally realized that this is wrong, and I climbed up because of the call of the world.</p><p>---004---</p><p>But the lies of the people can hurt each other, and the lies can deceive me, and the lies can hurt me more.</p><p>---005---</p><p>After I was finally discovered by someone, I was too tired to pretend.</p><p>---006---</p><p>For you, a thousand times over.</p><p>For you, a thousand times over.</p><p>---007---</p><p>We either like to find so many reasons to explain our cowardice, or deceive ourselves to believe those beautiful lies, or hide our fears, or escape from the sins we have committed. There is something that we have to face up to and redeem ourselves.</p><p>---008---</p><p>We either like to find so many reasons to explain our cowardice, or deceive ourselves to believe those beautiful lies, or hide our fears, or escape from the sins we have committed. There is something that we have to face up to and redeem ourselves.</p><p>---009---</p><p>But it is not natural for people to do this. If something happens in a certain period of time, you may feel that you will be different in a few years, and you will understand that you are different. But this is the breakthrough of our relationship. For you, thousands of times, I am still bruised and battered. Maybe this is life, and life is not just a small love worth having!</p><p>---010---</p><p>Do we know what the kite in our hearts is called? If we miss it in life, we can never get it. Maybe we have to repent and redeem it, but it seems too late now. When the kite is free and flies, do we do what we should do? Do we cherish everything we have?</p><p>---011---</p><p>I returned to my homeland, and I found myself like a traveler.</p><p>---012---</p><p>At different times in our lives, we have spared no effort to pursue the most persistent little things we can see. It may be just the special favor of our father, the friendship of our brothers, the secret love for a person, or the admiration of a husband. . . All the good things may become the kites in our hearts at that time. We run and think about it, and the good things we think about are them. But when time rolls on, do we find that what we once pursued or abandoned is worth it? In order to get it, we have chosen to abandon, betray, lie, and forbear. . . But the short-lived gains have not returned to us, and happiness and joy are just slowly drowned in self-blame, guilt and fear!</p><p>---013---</p><p>I look at the gray sky in the morning, and I am grateful for the sky, for the light, and for everything else.</p><p>---014---</p><p>There is only one kind of sin in the world, and that is theft. When you lie, you deprive someone of the right to know the truth.</p><p>---015---</p><p>I don&#39;t know the memories of the past. I only know that the memories are with me, and the beautiful memories are perfectly concentrated, like a thick ink, painted on the gray and monotonous canvas of our lives.</p><p>---016---</p><p>There are too many memories in the world, one of which is that there are no good ones.</p><p>---017---</p><p>A book is not a picture book, you can&#39;t just paint it with your favorite colors.</p><p>---018---</p><p>A seed that cannot stand up for itself can only grow up to be a coward.</p><p>---019---</p><p>We all have more or less had some little things in our hearts when we were young that we are ashamed of. These little things may accompany us throughout our lives like a shadow, and we can only look away. But time cannot turn back, and making up for it as much as we can, is it not a kind of self-salvation?</p><p>---020---</p><p>The person who once made a wish to pick up the kite for me thousands of times has passed away. The kite that was missed in life cannot be obtained. Maybe we can repent and redeem ourselves, but it seems too late now. Many years ago, when we were flying the kite, we asked ourselves whether we had cherished everything we had.</p><p>---021---</p><p>It has been so long since I left, long enough to be forgotten, and long enough to be forgotten.</p><p>---022---</p><p>&quot;Do you want her to see me chasing that kite?&quot; My Adam&#39;s apple moved up and down. The wind blew my hair. I think I saw me nodding. &quot;For you, thousands and thousands of times.&quot; I heard myself say. I have been here for many years.</p><p>---023---</p><p>The desert grass grows endlessly, but the spring flowers bloom and wither.</p><p>---024---</p><p>For you, thousands and thousands of times. For you, a thousand times over!</p><p>---025---</p><p>When sin leads to goodness, then the wind is not the only way to be saved by the Lord.</p><p>---026---</p><p>A good book is either about a sad hometown or a sad story.</p><p>---027---</p><p>Throughout our lives, we are only looking for the person we first met.</p><p>---028---</p><p>A person with a good conscience and good virtues will not suffer.</p><p>---029---</p><p>One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs</p><p>And the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls</p><p>---030---</p><p>Silence is peace, is great tranquility, is the knob that lowers the volume of life.</p><p>Silence is turning off the button, turning it down, turning it all off.</p><p>---031---</p><p>We say that we are either in sadness and narcissism. We succumb to failure and disaster, and regard these as a natural part of life, or even as a necessity. We say that life can only go on in a good way.</p><p>---032---</p><p>There is only one kind of sin, and that is theft. When you kill a man, you steal his life, you steal his wife and children, you take his children and use them for future use. When you lie, you steal his children. When you cheat, you steal his children.</p><p>---033---</p><p>I chased. The wind brushed my face, and my lips were like a breeze from Panjeshi. I chased.</p><p>---034---</p><p>Afghans like to say: life is either good or bad. They don&#39;t care about the beginning or the end, success or failure, danger or hope, just like nomads, slowly moving forward.</p><p>---035---</p><p>The good land of our country welcomes it with open arms. Spring comes naturally, and it will melt a snowflake for the first time in many years. Maybe what I just saw was the melting of the first snowflake.</p><p>---036---</p><p>Many years have passed, and people say that the old land can be buried, but I finally realized that this is wrong, and the good land has climbed up. I know that the new year is not just my child, but also the world. I have paid back some of my past sins that have not been redeemed. For you, I will do it thousands of times. I will be a good person again.</p><p>---037---</p><p>I must have seen that she has gained something, and I have gained something, which is more than courage.</p><p>---038---</p><p>In Afghanistan, there are so many children, and they all have a good childhood.</p><p>---039---</p><p>You can be so pure, and you will always feel like a liar when you are with you.</p><p>---040---</p><p>You know I saw everything in the alley, and you know I stood there and watched. You knew I betrayed you, but you saved me for the first time, maybe the last time. At that moment, I fell in love with you, and I loved you more than I loved anyone else. I just want to tell you that I am not a poisonous snake in the bushes or a monster at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>---041---</p><p>There is no such thing as free convenience. Love is perfect. You have to pay for everything. If you are a poor person, you can only spend money on pain. ----Naked, isn&#39;t it? Everything you do is different from the outside world.</p><p>---042---</p><p>Some little love stories are more important to her.</p><p>---043---</p><p>&quot;Have I ever lied to you, Master?&quot;</p><p>Instantly I decided to play with him and said: &quot;I don&#39;t know. Did you lie to me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I would rather die than lie to you.&quot; He said with an angry expression.</p><p>&quot;What do you mean? Are you really a neuter?&quot;</p><p>He looked at me doubtfully and said: &quot;What is the neuter?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If I tell you, are you still a neuter?&quot; I said. I know I&#39;m being cruel</p><p>&quot;If you still want her to beg, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you really fine? I&#39;m really fine, Master Ami?&quot;</p><p>I forced a smile, &quot;You&#39;re stupid, Hassan, you know I&#39;m not fine.&quot;</p><p>Hassan smiled at me, but he had to put on a brave face. &quot;I know.&quot; He said. This is the style of those people who keep their promises, thinking that they can keep their promises.</p><p>---044---</p><p>I have a lot to deal with in the future, and I hope to spend it alone.</p><p>---045---</p><p>A man who can&#39;t protect himself, what kind of people can&#39;t protect him when he grows up.</p><p>---046---</p><p>If an avalanche buries you, you fall under so much snow that you can&#39;t tell which is up and which is down. You want to dig yourself out, but your heart chooses the wrong thing, so you dig yourself out to death.</p><p>---047---</p><p>This is how we deal with fear: we have to sleep.</p><p>---048---</p><p>Time dulls the sharp edge of our memories.</p><p>As time passes, she gradually gets tired of this kind of behavior. She understands that summoning long-dead memories, dusting them off, and making them reappear is an increasingly exhausting task.</p><p>---049---</p><p>Our original life is gone, those people who died and were dying. Now there are only you and me. Only you and me.</p><p>---050---</p><p>One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs</p><p>And the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls</p><p>People can&#39;t tell how many bright moons there are on her roofs, and they can&#39;t tell how many bright suns there are on her walls</p><p>---051---</p><p>&quot;Do you want to see me chasing that kite like this?&quot;</p><p>My Adam&#39;s apple swallowed and moved up and down. The wind blew my hair. I think I nodded.</p><p>&quot;For you, thousands and thousands of times.&quot; I heard myself say.</p><p>I turned around and chased.</p><p>It was just a little thing, and I could use it. It was the only thing that could make all the little things come back to normal. It was the only thing that could make all the little things come back to normal. It was just a little thing, a little thing, like a leaf on a tree, shaking in the wind as the startled birds flew away.</p><p>The world welcomed it with open arms. It was the arrival of spring, or the first melting snowflake in years; maybe what I just saw was the melting of the first snowflake. I chased.</p><p>A grown man ran among a group of tall adults. I didn&#39;t care. I chased.</p><p>The wind brushed my face, and on my lips hung a big little thing like the wind in the valley of Panjiexi. I chased.</p><p>---052---</p><p>If the devil is still lingering in your mind, why would you talk about it?</p><p>---053---</p><p>I wiped my face with my sleeve, breaking the saliva bubble hanging from my lips. I buried my face in my hands and cried, talking about this long separation again. &quot;I miss Dad, and I miss him too,&quot; I choked up, &quot;I miss Sasha and my children. Sometimes I miss this family, but we are not here anymore...”</p><p>“Why?” I touched her arm, and she pulled it away.</p><p>“Why is that…” she sobbed, “Why is that…” she sobbed, “Why is that I don’t want you to see me… I’m so dirty.” She took a deep breath, then exhaled slowly, “I’m so dirty, and there’s so much sin all over me.” ”</p><p>---054---</p><p>Hassan once loved me deeply, and he treated me badly in the past, and I will never find it again.</p><p>---055---</p><p>It&#39;s like you have a toy that can fill the gap when you are no longer in the future.</p><p>Years of age can be called years of watching a thousand tragedies.</p><p>---056---</p><p>For you, a thousand times over.</p><p>---057---</p><p>I admire you dare to strike the courage</p><p>I admire your courage to fight against the majority with a small number of people</p><p>---058---</p><p>Dad said that it is wrong to hurt bad people. We don’t know what is good. When we were young, bad people sometimes played bad people.</p><p>---059---</p><p>Dad sees you as black and white. You have the final say on what is black and what is white. If you love him, you must be afraid of him, and even hate him.</p><p>---060---</p><p>His rubber boots kicked up bursts of snow, and he ran to the corner of the street. He stopped, turned around, put his hands on his mouth and said, &quot;For you, thousands and thousands of times! ”</p><p>---061---</p><p>I saw the face I was looking for. I saw the elegance of the person who was not ashamed of himself.</p><p>---062---</p><p>Can a thousand brilliant sunshines dispel the darkness brought by the smoke of war in Afghanistan? Only love can make us see these brilliant sunshines.</p><p>---063---</p><p>It may be unfair, but the occurrence of several things at the same time, sometimes even a small thing at the same time, is enough to change a lifetime.</p><p>---064---</p><p>I became who I am today on a cold and cloudy winter day in 1975, when I was a different person. I remember clearly that I was lying on the back of a collapsed mud wall, peeking into the alley, and saw an icy stream beside it. Many years have passed, and people say that the old man can be buried in the earth, but I finally realized that this is wrong, and the earth is the earth. I climbed up.</p><p>---065---</p><p>I understand now, this country that you have never seen before is invisible to you, and it doesn&#39;t care about your hopes, dreams, and sorrows at all. It is not the same as the skin and bones that cover the wind. It is so simple, so ridiculous, and yet so cruel. My call is to let people know this. You see, about how you are a person, it is natural to find that, or it may depend to a large extent on the symmetry of your skeleton, the distance between your neutrons will be different. The distance between the nose and the chin, the size of the projection angle of the nose tip, and whether there is a nose-frontal bone that you want. Beauty is a great gift that is not only good for you, but also stupid.</p><p>---066---</p><p>You are cowardly, this is your nature. This age is not a bad age, and you are either right or wrong.

The world is like a barren land, with hope and sadness; with dreams and disillusionment. The so-called future is not for us. The past left only this lesson: love is a wounding mistake, and its accomplice, hope, is a regretful fantasy.

A ray of sunlight shone on the bed, between us, and for a moment, a face ashen in the light that looked a lot like Hassan&#39;s, not the Hassan who played marbles with me and sang evening prayers as children, the Hassan who called us home, not the Hassan who chased us across the hills when the sun shone through the clay roof, but the Hassan I saw for the last time in my life, the Hassan I looked at through the misty window of my room, the Hassan who dragged his feet in the warm summer downpour, the Hassan who was stuffed into the car used by my father.</p><p>---085---</p><p>When you kill a person, you steal a life, you steal a wife, and you steal a child.

It was a sad little story about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he cried into the cup, his tears would turn into pearls. But despite being poor, he was a happy guy and rarely cried. So he spent years trying to make his own sorrows known, so that he could turn his tears into wealth. The pearls piled up, and he became greedier and greedier. The novel ends with the man sitting on a jeweled throne, holding a knife in his hand, holding the body of his beloved wife who died in an accident, and with the help of his father, his tears fell into the magic cup.</p><p>---089---</p><p>I want to say that you are my best friend in my life.</p><p>---090---</p><p>For you, thousands of times, I was bruised and battered, but I still look back.

I kneel on the street, kneel in a ditch, my head is hanging down, and I am in a strange place. I kneel on the hard ground, pray, my body is shaking, and the blood is soaked in my pants. The color of the objects is almost dark, and my long shadow is shaking back and forth on the gravel. I can&#39;t say anything. I step forward. Thousands of times, I can say, for you, thousands of times. I shake back and forth. I raised my head and saw a tiny scar on my upper lip.</p><p>I saw the barrel of the gun first, and then I saw the man standing on the ground. He was wearing a black vest and a long black robe. I looked down at the man who was covering my eyes, and I felt an endless emptiness in my heart. I took a step back, raised the barrel of the gun, and pointed it at the kneeling man. When I fired, the dim sunlight shone on my body, shining brightly.</p><p>The rifle made a deafening sound.</p><p>---099---</p><p>We stood in a field, with green grass and white clouds blowing in the wind.

They are some atonement gifts, some hypocritical and shameful gestures. They are not so much for the Lord to make her happy, but for her to live a peaceful life. Most of the time, we are just trying to satisfy our own desires. It seems that we are paying for others and hoping that they will be happy, but in fact, we are doing it for some kind of return. Such people are selfish. I used to be such a person. I could say that I was paying for others, but in the end, people found out. I feel regretful and guilty. I want to find a time to apologize. But the problem is that my apology is not just for my own satisfaction...</p><p>---118---</p><p>The streets are already empty-stomach and lonely, and I am not as good as I used to be.

The silence of my child is neither from the insight of the world nor the self-confidence of the country, nor the choice of silence to uphold your beliefs and express your protest, good things are a life She could not stop thinking about the darkness that had been there, the darkness seemed to have passed through her womb, enveloping her. When the night fell, she looked up at the dawn mist and saw a glimmer of light falling on the side of a boulder. It felt like she was born.</p><p>---124---</p><p>Why did she have to feel sad and cry?

Please tell me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I want her to see...&quot; she began, but she shrank back and put her hand to her throat, as if to clear the choke on her voice.

But at that moment, I wished I could tear open my veins and let all that damned blood flow out of my body.</p><p>---143---</p><p>For more than half a century, I have been looking after Suleiman. I have been living a life of my own for many years and have finally found that I have been able to have her company. Now I am free, and I can be the little world I thought I was living in, but I find that this freedom is just an illusion, because the little world I wanted to be in no longer exists. People say, go and find out, find out your life, and you will be able to return to your own life. But sometimes, you have to live a life that you can&#39;t realize until you realize that you already have a purpose for living a life that you may never have thought of. Now my purpose has been realized, I feel like I have been lost for years, and all I can do is drift with the flow.</p><p>---144---</p><p>I have been lost for years in a snowstorm. The wind is cold, blowing snowflakes, piercing my heart. I am trudging through the snow. I can call for help from behind, but the wind drowns out my cries. I collapse, lie on the snow, gasping for breath, looking at the whiteness, the wind whistles in my ears, and I see snowflakes erasing the footprints I just stepped on. I am a ghost now, I think, a ghost with footprints. I could only shout for the back of the house, hoping that the footprints would disappear with the wind.</p><p>---145---</p><p>It was more fun when I couldn&#39;t say goodbye. I guess it&#39;s not the same as it used to be.</p><p>---146---</p><p>There was a ghost in the lake, it grabbed Hassan&#39;s ankle and tried to get me to the bottom of the lake. I thought it was a ghost.</p><p>---147---</p><p>&quot;I...

All of this is still vivid in my mind. But after all these years, there is a greater purpose, and I have lost sight of it, and it has been left alone, helpless and unappreciated, buried deep in my heart. What I want to say is: I will never leave you. Your love for me is not what I want, but what I want to say when I need your help the most, and I will never leave you.</p><p>---150---</p><p>I hear the clock ticking in the hallway. And I think to myself, there are so many seconds, so many minutes, so many days, so many years, so many days, so many years waiting for me. All these times, I have to take care of them.</p><p>---151---</p><p>A man who can&#39;t even protect himself, what can he not protect when he grows up.</p><p>---152---</p><p>I feel deeply happy, happy to the point that I can&#39;t even use the master to say that I&#39;m afraid of others...

Hassan, the Hassan with a cleft lip, the kite chaser.</p><p>---154---</p><p>I lost myself in the blizzard for many years. The cold wind blew the snow and pierced my heart. I trudged through the snow. I cried out for help, but the wind drowned out my cries. I collapsed and lay gasping for breath in the snow, looking out into the distance. The wind whistled in my ears, and I saw snowflakes wiping out the footprints I had just left. I was a ghost now, I thought, a ghost with footprints. I cried out for help, but the wind drowned out my cries. I collapsed and lay gasping for breath in the snow, looking out into the distance. The wind whistled in my ears, and I saw snowflakes wiping out the footprints I had just left. I was a ghost now, I thought, a ghost with footprints. I cried out for help, but the wind drowned out my cries.The footprints disappeared. At this moment, someone was talking. I put my hands on my eyes and struggled to sit up. Through the curtain of snow and wind, I saw the swaying figures and the shaking colors. A familiar figure appeared. A hand stretched out in front of me, and I saw deep, large scars on the palm, blood dripping, dyeing the snow red.</p><p>---155---</p><p>Amy said: For you, thousands and thousands of times.</p><p>---156---</p><p>I finally got the convenience I had dreamed of for many years. But now that I have it, my heart also feels empty, and it is different from this swimming pool where I am shaking my legs in front of me.</p><p>---157---</p><p>I am the one who went to school, the one who reads and writes abroad, and the one who is smart and clever. Although Hassan thought he couldn&#39;t understand the first-grade textbook, he could see through me in his heart.</p><p>---158---</p><p>I tried to recall the cold face of Akanshi, and wanted to see his peaceful eyes with all my strength, but time was so greedy - sometimes, it was better to swallow all the details alone.</p><p>---159---</p><p>He had the ability to be a good person this time.</p><p>---160---</p><p>I tell you, even if he was shot with a thousand bullets, he would not say a word about such a dirty and obscene thing. My face was hot, and a wave of guilt surged in my heart. I was so guilty, and my past and present were all due to the ulcers, black nails and sore wrists. I was determined to sacrifice myself for my father. This was the last time. I cursed myself. I was jealous, and my secret was out, spoken, and solved. Maybe it was all for the better, and it was not the same as the Afghans, who were free people who lived their lives according to their own rules. They had to see if social norms made sense first, and then decide to follow them or reject them. Hassan had loved me deeply, and he had treated me differently before, and he would never do that again.</p><p>---161---</p><p>I told Homer that I was a child and that I felt that I was fighting against him. I can tell you that after I was born with love, I finally got to know you. It was this that won me over.</p><p>---162---</p><p>Hassan and I drank from the same breast. We took our first steps on the same lawn in the same yard. There, under the same roof, we said our first words. I said &quot;Dad&quot;. He said &quot;Ami&quot;. My name. Looking back now, the story I created in the winter of 1975 and the story that followed it has already laid the foundation for this word.</p><p>---163---</p><p>Support me.

But when I stood in the sunshine with Tasha, I suddenly felt that nothing had happened in the past few years. She watched the death of the warriors, the marriage with the Greeks, the killings, the rockets, the battles, the wind, the hunger, even the seed of her life, all of which seemed like a big dream; the time of so many years seemed like a strange time difference, separating the afternoon of the most dreamy and the full moment.</p><p>---167---</p><p>You have to tell me, I must put it into the neutron, so fast and so good. I left it on the shore before I set off. I beg you to find it, sister, so you must know what I was thinking when I sank into the neutron.</p><p>---168---</p><p>“When you kill a man, you steal a life”Baba said.“You steal his wife’s right to a husband,rob his children of a father.When you tell a lie,you steal someone&#39;s right to the truth.When you cheat,you steal the right to fairness.Do you see?”</p><p>---169---</p><p>We are like leaves on the same tree, falling from the same tree, but the wind blows us away, and we are separated by the tree, but we can still find the roots of the tree.</p><p>---170---</p><p>I returned to my country and found myself like a tourist.</p><p>---171---</p><p>There is only one kind of crime, only one kind. It is theft, and it is not the same as theft.</p><p>---172---</p><p>I know you are young and you are not in a good situation, but I hope you can find out now and live this life in your own way. To be honest, marriage can wait, and education is not a waste. You are a very smart woman. You can do it. You can&#39;t be what you want to be. I know this very well. I know that when the war is over, the man who wants her to see you will see you, and even the man who wants her to see you will see you more. In addition, if a woman is not educated, there is a possibility that she will be able to make progress. It is possible.</p><p>---173---</p><p>At the same time, there were a thousand pieces of glass flying around her. I felt that I could see the pieces flying around her, slowly, one by one, turning over and over again, and there seemed to be sunlight shining on the pieces. Like a small beautiful rainbow. The part where my family was bombed was also tear-jerking. The gentle and deep ten people suddenly died in front of me. I didn&#39;t expect that my growth over the past seven years would be suddenly interrupted and turned into a terrifying valley. The cruelest thought is also the most poetic expression. The extreme pain makes people&#39;s tear glands numb instantly, but instead produces a strange dizziness that is almost addictive.</p><p>---174---</p><p>Like a compass that points north, a man&#39;s accusing finger always finds a woman.

It can make all the little things in the world return to normal. It can also make all the little things in the world return to normal.

A thin crescent moon, holding her own dim heart, also reflects the shadow of her child.</p><p>---188---</p><p>In her life, in her entire life, there is always a huge lack of me. In some unknown way, she felt that she had this special feeling. &quot;Brother.&quot; She said. She was aware that she was missing something, and she was also aware that she was crying. A song that they all loved, a passage from the song suddenly floated to her tongue: I know the sad fairy, the evening breeze will blow it differently.</p><p>---189---</p><p>But knowing this is so important, knowing your roots, knowing the beginning of your life. If you don&#39;t know, your life seems to be a mystery. Do you understand? It&#39;s like you missed the beginning of your hometown, and suddenly you are in the middle, trying hard to figure it out.</p><p>---190---</p><p>The world has put aside all new and old hatreds. She finally realized that this was the only hometown that she could reach. She could only go on. There was no hope.</p><p>---191---</p><p>Staring at the starry sky, watching the clouds drifting by. I have to think back on my long life and be grateful for the blessings and joys I have received. I have to understand that there is either more boredom, more desire, or too much shamelessness. I have to sigh happily, or listen to the rustling of the wind and the chirping of night birds.</p><p>---192---</p><p>I felt like I was falling into an abyss, desperately trying to grab branches and thorny vines, and my heart was also thinking about what to do.</p><p>---193---</p><p>People can sleep even if they are bitten by poisonous snakes, but they can sleep when they are hungry.</p><p>---194---</p><p>I became who I am today on a cold and cloudy winter day in 1975, and I was born that year. I remember that I was lying on the ground in front of a collapsed mud wall, looking at the alleyway and seeing a frozen stream beside it. Many years passed, and people said that the old things could be buried, but I finally realized that this was wrong, and I climbed out of the deserted path. Looking back, I realized that in the past two or six years, I had finally found myself on the deserted path.</p><p>---195---</p><p>For many years, I began to believe that among all the hardships a person has to face, there is nothing more painful than simply waiting.</p><p>---196---</p><p>Words can suddenly burst into silence, sometimes cold and empty, sometimes lurking and silent, but they will eventually return to each other, like a dark cloud that can never fall. On some nights, I dreamed that I was in a desert, alone, with only a tiny light flickering in the air, flickering, like a codeword.</p><p>---197---</p><p>She told herself that we were all in this together.</p><p>---198---</p><p>I am grateful for the night that fell, covering Hassan&#39;s face and covering my face. I don&#39;t need to look at my heart anymore. Do you know me? If you know, what do you think you will see when you look at the scholars? Complaints? Shame? Or, I am afraid that I will not be able to stop myself from seeing what I am most afraid of seeing: sincere devotion. After all these years of looking at scholars, that is what I least want to see.</p><p>---199---</p><p>&quot;You say this is childishness. Childishness is the so-called shame.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are wrong. Childishness is not good for the country and makes the country lose its noble sentiments.People even had a different and bigger style after many years and needed to see it. &quot;</p><p>---200---</p><p>I sat down by the window. Suleiman had a cup of tea in his hand, which he put on a plate at my feet. I went out and it was a sunny morning. The shopkeepers who got up late were all looking for a way to open the door. The boy was sitting on the table with his son. The dust was already flying. There was a lazy dog ​​on the table, and mosquitoes were like black clouds, circling around the dog&#39;s head. I saw a young man riding a motorcycle, sitting astride the shelf at the rear of the car, carrying a computer monitor on one shoulder and a melon on the other.</p><p>I pressed my forehead against the warm glass.</p><p>---201---</p><p>Now I understand, this is the one who can&#39;t see you, it doesn&#39;t care about your hopes, dreams, and sorrows, they are not the same as the skin and bone marrow. It&#39;s so simple, so absurd, but so cruel.</p><p>---202---</p><p>She can&#39;t see the mark left by your brother in her heart, and her heart is like a pale and gray beach, the waves of sadness rush up and smash, rush up and smash, and the footprints of my child are washed away.</p><p>---203---</p><p>&quot;&quot; You can&#39;t worry about it, you&#39;ll be relieved in your life. But it hurts.</p><p>---204---</p><p>Mariam lay on the sofa, her hands tucked into her knees, watching the snowflakes swirling and dancing in the window. She remembered what Nana had said to her: a snowflake is the sigh of a sad woman in the world. She thought of all these sighs floating up, gathering into clouds, turning into tiny snowflakes, falling silently on the people below. The snowflakes reminded her of how much we women have suffered, how quietly we have endured all the disasters that have befallen us.</p><p>---205---</p><p>If there is a thing that has to travel too long in the wilderness and is captured by despair, then why does it have to stop halfway and die? I can&#39;t help but think of the falcon feather that Pari found in the desert. I can&#39;t help but imagine that the feather is loosened from the bird, dancing and swirling in the clouds, in the violent currents, being carried and pushed by the howling wind, flying over thousands of deserts, hundreds of mountains and rivers, and finally appearing in front of me, floating at the foot of a huge rock, and being found by my little sister. I can&#39;t help but linger on this special imagination, which brings not only the initial surprise, but also the hope of a better life in the future, and I hope that all this can come true.</p><p>---206---</p><p>I saw that my father&#39;s car drove up and found a person, and the first word he said in his life was my name.</p><p>---207---</p><p>You have to hope. Like Shuja, your days in Shadbagh are numbered. Now you realize it. You can&#39;t miss it anymore. You can&#39;t go home. You have to wait outside for the winter to pass. Wait for the spring to come with the thaw. Some morning, before dawn, you can get up and step out of the house. You can find a way to go west with your children. Your feet can move, you can move, you can move, you can leave Shadbagh. If you walk too long in the wilderness, you will be captured by despair, so you can stop halfway and die.</p><p>---208---</p><p>Perhaps this sudden change is a punishment for the unrighteous, and I have to wait until everything is too bad to be reversed before I realize it</p><p>---209---</p><p>In a brief flash, I saw a scene I will never forget: Hassan holding a silver plate, serving Asad and Vassar a drink. Suddenly, the light disappeared, but something hissed, something burst, and then there was an orange flame: Asad was standing there, tapping Hassan&#39;s chest with a knuckle.</p><p>From the beginning, things were pitiful, and there was nothing good to see.</p><p>---210---</p><p>I wish to do it for you thousands of times</p><p>---211---</p><p>People say that old people can be buried in a grave, but I finally understand that this is wrong. They are all called out by the world.</p><p>---212---</p><p>I know what the thoughts lingering in my mind are, but how can I be like a book that can be opened in front of me? I am the one who goes to school, I am the one who reads and writes, and I am the smart one. Although Hassan can&#39;t read the first grade textbook, he seems to be able to see through me in his heart. This makes people uneasy, but someone knows your needs very well, which makes people feel relieved.</p><p>---213---</p><p>For some people, and especially for some women, marriage—even unhappy marriage—is an escape from a more unhappy state.</p><p>---214---</p><p>In the end, it&#39;s either this or that. It&#39;s just that you&#39;ve won. It&#39;s so small.</p><p>---215---</p><p>She must have gained something, something, and there&#39;s a lot of courage to talk about. But I&#39;m not here for the convenience of the world.</p><p>---216---</p><p>Although I know the answer is hard to solve, the benefits are there. They are there, waiting for someone to take a chalk and scribble them down.</p><p>---217---</p><p>Only when she is ready to deprive you of a certain convenience, you will be so happy.</p><p>---218---</p><p>I opened my mouth and almost shouted. If I shouted, the rest of my life would be completely changed. But I was not happy, I just said it, and I was numb.</p><p>---219---</p><p>I thought of Hassan&#39;s dream, the dream in which we were swimming in the lake. There was a ghost in it. To be honest, there was only the lake. But I was wrong. There was a ghost in the lake, it grabbed Hassan&#39;s ankle, and it made me feel like I was at the bottom of the lake. I thought it was a ghost.</p><p>---220---</p><p>I had a completely different feeling of wanting to escape with her. I knew that this was the inevitable ending. This clear, desperate feeling was the result of growing up and becoming disgusting.</p><p>---221---</p><p>I thought I lost you.</p><p>---222---</p><p>Can&#39;t you come to me, Suleiman?</p><p>I came, I came a hundred times!</p><p>Who do you think I am, a deaf kid or a lazy bug?</p><p>Do I need to choose? You are not the same!</p><p>Otherwise, she would look at me, lying on the bed by herself, and she would say I am a lazy bug.</p><p>---223---</p><p>I dreamed that flowers would bloom in the streets of Kabul, music would play in the teahouses, and kites would fly in the sky. I dreamed that one day, you would return to Kabul and revisit the land we once lived in. If you return, you would find a loyal friend waiting for you.</p><p>---224---</p><p>It was warm, sunny, and the lake was as clear as a mirror. There were no people swimming in the lake, but there were ghosts. There were ghosts lurking in the lake, waiting for you.</p><p>---225---</p><p>Since then, Hassan has disrupted my life. I have tried not to meet him as much as possible so that I can plan my life accordingly. I was standing there, breathing in a bubble of air. But the air was not above me, and I could still feel it, on the wicker chair, on the clothes that had been hand-starched and ironed, in front of the warm shoes that were placed in my heart, and when I went downstairs for breakfast, I sat on the wood burning in the stove. I can&#39;t tell you where I am, I can&#39;t see the signal of loyalty, I can&#39;t tell you the damned, unwavering loyalty.</p><p>---226---</p><p>To tell you, the words on the page are not just some lines but boundaries, convenient for keeping secrets. Words are a secret door, and the key is in my hand.</p><p>---227---</p><p>I tell you this because I want you to know that fear is the opposite of what you do, and you don&#39;t have to be ashamed of it.</p><p>---228---</p><p>Something happened in my heart that I can&#39;t explain. At this moment, it&#39;s still the same. Over the years, she and I have spent thousands of moments together, but this moment is the brightest, it vibrates in my heart and gives the loudest response: I look up at her, chin up, the bright sunlight flickers on her skin, she looks at me, I don&#39;t know, she can also tell how kind and strong I am.</p><p>---229---</p><p>San Jose State University has a lot of people who talk about clichés: &quot;You should avoid them like the plague.&quot; I have to make up for my own humor. The whole class also said that I had to make up, but I felt that this accusation of clichés was worthless. They are all wrong in their correctness. But the good thing is that people take these statements as clichés, and their appropriateness is better mentioned by people.</p><p>---230---</p><p>God controls the world, and He also controls everything. He created life and death. It is your honor to pass His test.</p><p>---231---</p><p>Our winter is either returned by nature or it is different. The scar reminds us to miss this most beloved season.</p><p>---232---</p><p>I am so dirty, and I am full of sins.</p><p>---233---</p><p>I forgot how to face it, and tried to squeeze out a face, and a trace of blood flowed down my chin. &quot;Can you do me a favor?&quot;</p><p>&quot;For you, a thousand times over,&quot; Fasher said.</p><p>The wind suddenly blew and I started to cry. My breath came in short gasps, and tears rushed down my face, stinging the flesh of my lips.</p><p>---234---</p><p>For her, elegance came so effortlessly, as if it was an innate skill.</p><p>---235---</p><p>The story goes on.</p><p>---236---</p><p>Time is so greedy - sometimes it swallows all the details alone.</p><p>---237---</p><p>Baba Ayub didn&#39;t understand. Just as she didn&#39;t know why, when she heard the bell, she felt a wave, like the end of a bitter dream, or a strong wind that swept over her every few years, and she was startled. But it passed, like all past little things. It passed.</p><p>---238---</p><p>Maybe she said, you are afraid that I will get the happiness you don&#39;t have, you don&#39;t want me to be happy. You don&#39;t want me to live a good life. You are the one with a cruel heart. This is Mariam&#39;s monologue at this moment, and she finally didn&#39;t know why she suddenly said that they lived in this small village, and they didn&#39;t have anything to do with their brothers. She didn&#39;t understand why Nana had to endure. In a world where women are in a low position, perhaps endurance is the only thing they can do.</p><p>---239---</p><p>&quot;She said, &#39;I&#39;m so scared.&#39; I said, &#39;Why?&#39; She said, &#39;I&#39;m so happy, I&#39;m so happy, I&#39;m so happy, I&#39;m so scared.&#39; I said, &#39;You&#39;re so happy only when you&#39;re ready to take away something.&#39; I said, &#39;It&#39;s stupid.&#39;&quot;</p><p>---240---</p><p>The heart of a man is a vicious thing, Mariam. It&#39;s not like a womb. It doesn&#39;t have to bleed, it doesn&#39;t have to make room for you. I&#39;m the only one who loves you. I&#39;m all you&#39;ve ever had in this world, Mariam; and if she sees me as different, you don&#39;t have anything else. You don&#39;t have anything else. You don&#39;t have anything else!</p><p>---241---</p><p>&quot;Hassan!&quot; I yelled, &quot;Come back!&quot;</p><p>His rubber boots kicked up gusts of snow and he was already running around the corner. He stopped, turned around, put his hands on his mouth and said, &quot;For you a thousand times!&quot; He smiled like Hassan, and I was different at the corner...</p><p>---242---</p><p>Aren&#39;t we different? We once longed to escape, to change our appearance, to be reborn.? At the end of the tunnel, shouldn&#39;t we just cut the anchor chain that tied us and free ourselves? But I laughed at it and said that I didn&#39;t have any doubts, telling myself that we were not the same in the same way, so I was angry at it, maybe just using it as a mask to hide my jealousy, because she saw that I was more successful than me in this little advantage.</p><p>---243---</p><p>&quot;Peace be upon you, and be blessed by the name of the Peace Be upon you, and be blessed by the name of the Messenger of Peace Be upon you, and may the souls of Peace Be upon you be blessed and at peace&quot;</p><p>&quot;You made the night come to life, and you made life come to night; you made the dead come to the living, and you made the living become the dead, and you generously grant support to those you love&quot;</p><p>---244---</p><p>I said to myself that I was looking for a different kind of world. But an increasingly strong feeling told me that I was wandering, waiting for the wind to come to me, and there was still a lot of things on earth, which would change everything, and I had to spend my entire life to pave the way for its arrival.</p><p>---245---</p><p>At that moment I fell in love with her, and I loved her more than I loved anyone else. I just wanted to tell her that I was not a poisonous snake in the bushes or a ghost at the bottom of the lake. I was not worthy of her sacrifice. I was a liar, a cheater, and a thief.</p><p>---246---</p><p>She shed tears of sorrow, anger, and broken dreams. The tears she shed were deep and humiliating; she once missed her husband so much, worried about what clothes to wear, worried about the headscarf that didn&#39;t match her, how she could not get here, refused to leave, and slept on the street like a stray dog. Now she realized how stupid all this was. She seemed to be ashamed of the harsh words she had used on him, and the tears that had swollen her eyes. Nana had warned her earlier, and it seemed that Nana was right.</p><p>---247---</p><p>&quot;What does &#39;wonderful&#39; mean?&quot;</p><p>I laughed out loud, and we hugged each other, and rubbed my face.</p><p>&quot;Why is that?&quot; My face blushed, and I didn&#39;t say anything.</p><p>I pushed my face in a friendly way, smiled, and said, &quot;You are Fangzi, Hassan. You are Fangzi, and I love you.&quot;</p><p>---248---</p><p>We walked into a smoky teahouse and saw her holding a cup of tea. I looked up at her, stepped out of the chair, and wiped my face with my hands.</p><p>The feeling of falling into the abyss gradually disappeared... I was at a loss, so I had to re-evaluate the situation and find my own way.</p><p>---249---</p><p>There are too many combinations, and they are a bit artificial.</p><p>---250---</p><p>You can&#39;t demonize them, you can humanize them.</p><p>---251---</p><p>Now I can become a good person.</p><p>---252---</p><p>Standing in the cold basement and looking at the people, I felt that there were many pairs of blinking eyes watching us in the darkness. I saw people huddled in the room, and there was still a dim kerosene lamp above, and many shadows were projected on the wall. People in the basement were whispering, and besides that, they didn&#39;t know what was going on. They didn&#39;t know what was going on. There was a sound of a little scratch.</p><p>---253---</p><p>You almost won the game, didn&#39;t you? You either almost won or you won. The winner won the game, and the others could only go home.</p><p>---254---</p><p>We knew the pattern of our quarrels: they were always aggressive, unyielding, and kept roaring; Dad was about to say something, but he looked docile and confused, nodded obediently, and waited for the storm to pass.</p><p>---255---</p><p>For a few minutes, none of us spoke. Whatever I had said, it lingered in our minds, the pain of life&#39;s oppression, the happiness that could never be found together.</p><p>---256---</p><p>I couldn&#39;t accept it, I couldn&#39;t accept that I was just the same as her.</p><p>---257---</p><p>Mariam taped the yarn to the doll&#39;s head. In a few years, the little girl would grow up to be a woman who had too many demands on her life, who could not burden her master, who could not reveal her own sorrows, hopes, and dreams that were once laughed at by many people. This woman is like a rock in the riverbed, enduring the erosion of the wind without complaint, and she regards the holy things she sees as undefiled, and she lives a more noble life. Lai has seen something in this woman&#39;s heart, which is a quality hidden in the depths of her soul, which is the belief that my son Sid or Ta felt that I could not destroy.</p><p>---258---</p><p>It is just a little bit, and it can be used. It can restore all the little things. It can also restore the little things. It was just a little thing, a tiny thing, like a leaf in a tree, shaking in the air as a startled bird flew away. But the world welcomed it with open arms. It was the arrival of spring, the first melting of a snowflake; or maybe what I just saw was the melting of the first snowflake. I ran. A grown man ran among a group of tall grown men. But I didn&#39;t care. I ran, the wind brushed my face, and on my lips hung a big little thing like Panjiexi&#39;s return in the valley. I ran.</p><p>---259---</p><p>What caused the resentment, corrupted the kindness of the people, the help she saw, and the heroic deeds she saw? Is it the shadow of gratitude that can be cast on them. This is her need, this is the debt she sees you bear. She saw it as cash, something to buy loyalty and obedience. Now I understand why Mary and Lina left so many years ago. The rope that held you and me together has become a noose around your neck. People always feel hopeless, and I do. We have to pay our debts, and we have to pay our debts. I also got the consolation prize after returning home. I was in love with my child.</p><p>---260---</p><p>Ami was born in Kabul and Hassan was born in Kabul.</p><p>---261---</p><p>But I was in Libya. Standing in the sunshine with Tashi, my child suddenly felt that nothing had happened in the past few years. She saw the death of the sultan, the marriage with the sultan, the killings, the rockets, the blasts, the wind, the hunger, even the seed of her childhood, all of which seemed like a big dream;</p><p>---262---</p><p>She kept talking about how beautiful Kab was, how the Mughal babu had been born and how she had found him. Majyam knew, and then she talked about Kab&#39;s gardens, shops, trees and space, and she got on the bus, and she talked about the wind and the difference, and she talked happily, and she waved her arms intermittently.</p><p>&quot;I used to adore you,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;For many years, I have been worried that you will not be able to survive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I pray that you will live long. I don&#39;t know,&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know if you think I am your shame.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think I am your shame.&quot;</p><p>---263---</p><p>&quot;Come on. This is the time to be a good person.&quot; My son said this before hanging up the phone. It was casually mentioned, and it seemed as if it had been carefully considered.</p><p>This is the time to be a good person.</p><p>---264---</p><p>You opened your mouth, so wide that even your palate creaked. You ordered your lungs to breathe in more air, and now you can see more air, and now the wind is blowing. What&#39;s happening is that your lungs won&#39;t obey you. They collapse, tighten, compress, and suddenly you can only breathe through a straw. Your mouth is closed, your lips are pursed, and all you can do is let out a choking cough. Your hands twitch and shake. It&#39;s as if a dam has burst in the past few years, and cold sweat is pouring out, soaking your body. You want to cry out. If you can, you must cry out. But you have to do something else to cry out.</p><p>---265---</p><p>His rubber boots kicked up gusts of snow and he was already running to the corner of the street. Hit, stopped, turned, put his hands over his mouth and said, &quot;For you, thousands and thousands of times!&quot; Hi gave a Hassan smile and disappeared on the corner. I had never seen it so brilliantly before, in six years, on a faded Polaroid.</p><p>---266---</p><p>I held my breath, waiting for the moment to come, waiting for the wind to blow my face open, muttering, &quot;Oh, this is the one.&quot; Waiting for the dream to fall into my palms, as if it were a petal dancing in the wind, or falling from the tree. I said to myself, this is the dream - I have said before, all the beautiful things in life are fragile, and they are not easy to lose - I put my hands close to my face, stroked my forehead with my palms, and rubbed happiness into my mind.</p><p>---267---</p><p>Hassan&#39;s answer was so simple that he could only say one word, so he said in a hoarse and weak voice, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>My body clenched, as if I had been slapped in the face by my father.</p><p>---268---</p><p>When you lie, you steal the power of others.</p><p>---269---</p><p>For me, America is a place where I bury my children.</p><p>For my father, it is a place where I mourn the past.</p><p>---270---</p><p>(2) Her resignation may be due to her fear of her husband&#39;s demands, or it may be due to the fact that she has seen the extravagant life. Although I don&#39;t know why, most likely, she is resigned to her fate for the same reason as my father: because she cannot bear the fate. What choice was there? Adrian could not escape his life any more than Dum could escape his. People would say that they had to endure the most unimaginable world. It had to be good. This was his life. This was his voice. This was his life. It had to be his life. It had to be his life, even if he was confused.</p><p>Adrian did not know that he had to love her like he had before, when he had curled up in her big arms and fell asleep in happiness. Now it was too incredible. But you can&#39;t say you&#39;ve fallen in love again, even if now it&#39;s a different, more complicated, and more difficult love affair. Ade was born and could almost feel that he was jumping out of childhood. So soon, he&#39;s grown up. Things will wait until he grows up.</p><p>---271---</p><p>Afghans are a monomaniacal people. Afghans respect customs but hate rules, and kite fighting is no exception. The rules are simple: fly your kite, cut your opponent&#39;s string, and good luck.</p><p>---272---</p><p>She looked at Hassan and said, &quot;I&#39;m going to say it&#39;s sad, but it&#39;s more hurtful to say it&#39;s not good for you.&quot;</p><p>---273---</p><p>People say, go find out, find out the purpose of your life, and then you will have the purpose of your life. But sometimes, only when you have lived, you can realize that you already have the purpose of your life, maybe you have never thought of it before.</p><p>---274---</p><p>Through the veil of the heart, she saw the soft hills, the blue sky, the sunset falling on the mill, and the world will always be bright, and at the end of the world, dimly, dimly, is a group of neutrons.</p><p>---275---</p><p>It is crazy to use the master. Absolutely pure and easy to be confused. It is a breathtaking folly, to believe in your own reason, to disregard the huge odds, to believe that a year can be beyond your control, to believe that it will never be taken away from you, and that you will never suffer the same thing as the world.</p><p>---276---</p><p>(In one)</p><p>There are many more things to come, and things will always be there, and at the end of things, there is a hazy group of neutrons.</p><p>---277---</p><p>Among all the hardships a person must face, there is nothing more painful than simply waiting.</p><p>---278---</p><p>In the place where it was discovered, the sky was as dark as a lead sheet, and the soil could stretch out from the ground. I saw a row of bowl-shaped neutron hills. There was a small village along the wind.Wang Zi Neng, hanging on the hillside of Xiyang in the childhood.</p><p>---279---</p><p>(3) All the differences and good things about each other cannot be looked back. For all the adults, the wind is like the words of the heroes when they were young: a hero for a day, a hero for death.</p><p>---280---</p><p>But the wind is not as good as I can say, I still feel it, the wind is there, the wind is there, the clothes that have been washed and ironed by hand on the rattan chair, the shoes that are placed in front of my heart, the warm things that have been made in my heart, and the firewood that burns in the stove when I go downstairs for breakfast. No matter where I am, I can&#39;t see the signs of loyalty, the damned, unwavering loyalty.</p><p>---281---</p><p>If a woman is not educated, then this society has no chance of being used.</p><p>---282---</p><p>It&#39;s like you don&#39;t see your own side, it doesn&#39;t care about your hopes, dreams, and sorrows, which are covered by skin and bones. It&#39;s so simple, so ridiculous, and yet so cruel.</p><p>---283---</p><p>She felt shocked, this is not the first time, she felt both admiration and uneasiness, because she didn&#39;t know her own voice well enough. One thing that surprised everyone was that the girl was not so vocal, and that was the seduction of the girl&#39;s casualness and skill. She was also very good at doing it. She was not good at attracting men&#39;s attention. She was greedy for men.</p><p>---284---</p><p>Time was like the accordion that Tashirk used to play the ancient Pushkin songs, which could expand and contract depending on whether Tashirk was in her eyes or not.</p><p>---285---</p><p>What should she say to Nana? Mariam thought. How should she apologize? How could she face Nana now?</p><p>…Then the wind stopped in front of her and tried to cover her eyes, while she looked at him and pushed him back, saying, &quot;Hey! Hey! Now hey! There&#39;s more to come! Hey!&quot;</p><p>But the wind was not coming fast enough. Mariam saw it. A strong wind blew, blowing open the willow branches that were hanging like curtains, and Mariam saw the scene under the tree: the chair that was stretched out like a backrest, fell down. A rope was hanging from the branch behind the house. Nana was dangling at the end of the rope.</p><p>---286---</p><p>Maybe there is a place that is not so charming, or there is a place that can deceive you. But I was a child, an unhappy boy, trapped in my own anger. I felt wronged. I didn&#39;t get what I deserved. Everyone loved me. I didn&#39;t love me enough. I wanted her to hug me, rock me, comfort me. But it was wrong to accept these things. I couldn&#39;t accept them. I couldn&#39;t accept her and she was exactly the same as what I wanted.</p><p>---287---</p><p>Suffering and despair, for many years in this world, were like waves. It either rolls out of the bed, crashes against the moldy wall, or pounces back at you. You drown in front of the eyes.</p><p>---288---</p><p>Atoning for sins does not equate happiness</p><p>---289---</p><p>Sober, lonely and accompanied by my own demons.</p><p>---290---</p><p>The air is filled with screams. It is not just a smell, but more like a tangible existence. I can feel it. Screams are like steam filling the room.</p><p>---291---</p><p>It is a piece of history. Too many things come and go. It is like reading your own indictment.</p><p>---292---</p><p>A wave of indescribable darkness, like the wind blowing through the willows by the mud house, never stopped blowing and blowing Mariam.</p><p>---293---</p><p>It was alms, and she should have felt relieved. But it hurt her. She felt its blow, like an axe on her head.</p><p>---294---</p><p>You know what happened, but it was a wind that had come back, and we had all forgotten it was coming.</p><p>---295---</p><p>Suddenly I wanted to give up. Since I already knew the outcome, why did she have to let herself experience it all?</p><p>---296---</p><p>She leaned against the wall, lit a cigarette, puffed slowly, with a charming grace, holding the cigarette with her fingers, raised her lips for many times, and curled her hands in front of her mouth. I watched her intently.</p><p>---297---</p><p>In the end, it was either this or you won my heart.</p><p>---298---</p><p>You are afraid, Nana, she said, you are afraid that I will not get the happiness you don&#39;t have, you don&#39;t want me to be happy. You don&#39;t want me to live a good life, you are the one with a vicious heart.</p><p>---299---</p><p>I have had so many beautiful love stories in my life, so many happy love stories, I wonder what I deserve.</p><p>---300---</p><p>&quot;I know you too, you know? I have a good relationship with her. I fucked her in the alley.&quot; &quot;Her pussy is so tight,&quot; he said, shaking hands with the others, laughing loudly.</p><p>---301---</p><p>Hassan knew. He knew I saw everything in the alley, and knew I was standing there, watching. He knew I betrayed him, but he saved me for the first time, maybe the last time. At that moment, I fell in love with him, loving him more than I love anyone. I just want to tell you that I am not a venomous snake in the bushes, a monster at the bottom of the lake. I don&#39;t deserve to be sacrificed, I&#39;m a liar, I&#39;m a cheat, I&#39;m a thief.</p><p>---302---</p><p>There is only one kind of sin, only one kind. That is theft, and the other kind of sin is theft. When you hurt someone, you steal their life, you steal their wife and children, you take their children away from them. When you lie, you steal their children. When you cheat, you steal their children. There is nothing more evil than theft, theft is an unforgivable sin.</p><p>---303---</p><p>They said goodbye so quickly, leaving me to struggle with my feelings: she wanted to be comforted by others, but she felt sorry for others. She could not find a good way to leave her brother in her heart. Her heart was like a pale and gray beach, with sad waves rushing up and smashing it, rushing up and smashing it, leaving no trace of her footprints.</p><p>---304---</p><p>The verses of the Koran echoed in the room, and I remembered the ancient legend that my father could fight a black bear with his bare hands. Dad spent his life fighting bears. He lost his wife, who was still young; he raised his son alone; he left his beloved homeland, his country; he suffered poverty and humiliation. He finally reached a place where a bear came that he could not defeat. He was defeated, but he would never give in.</p><p>---305---</p><p>Joseph&#39;s country returned to Canaan, please mourn for God</p><p>The hut&#39;s country returned to the rose garden, please mourn for God</p><p>If the flood came like this, it would swallow all life in the world</p><p>Noah&#39;s boat was your guide in the center of the storm, please mourn for God</p><p>---306---</p><p>Hassan did not resist, and even groaned with his friends. I turned my head slightly and saw her face, which was full of resignation. I had seen this kind of expression before, this kind of lamb expression.</p><p>---307---</p><p>My child decided not to let her see her anger and anger, what&#39;s the point? Mariam was so smart, what&#39;s the point? I could only let things go on, no hope!</p><p>---308---</p><p>&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have I lied to you, Master?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. Did you lie to me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d rather die than lie to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How can you tell? What did you return to me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean by neutron?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What neutron?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If I told you, would you be fine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you find her, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; But I doubt if you are the one who said that. Are you the one who said that? Master, you are not the one who said that. &quot;</p><p>&quot;You are stupid, Hassan, you know I am not the one who said that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know. The kite is coming.&quot;</p><p>From Hassan and Amy</p><p>---309---</p><p>Maybe I stood there for less than a minute, and today, it is still the longest minute in my life. Time passed by second by second, and the difference between one second and another seemed to be separated by eternity.</p><p>---310---</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what I did wrong, Ami. I hope you can tell me why we don&#39;t play together anymore.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hello, are you wrong or are you still in love with me, Hassan, you are different.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can tell me, I&#39;ll change.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what I want you to do.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Go ahead.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I still want her to see how you can harass me, I still want her to see you are different.&quot;</p><p>From Hassan and Ami&#39;s story</p><p>---311---</p><p>She seemed to be glad that she was wearing a burqa, and glad that Aziza couldn&#39;t see the burqa, but she seemed to be heartbroken.</p><p>---312---</p><p>Little ones, adults like this, when I think of you, please never tell her that you have to &quot;Haza my child and the world is a man of variety&quot;. You have to have a name, you have to search for your child&#39;s name on the Internet.</p><p>---313---</p><p>I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.</p><p>I admire your optimism about the odds</p><p>---314---</p><p>There is only one sin, only one. And that is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft. When you kill a man, you steal a life, you steal his wife&#39;s right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone&#39;s right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. Do you see?</p><p>---315---</p><p>We stuffed cotton balls in our ears and covered our heads with blankets. Daddy&#39;s snoring sounded like a roaring car engine, and it still came through the walls. There was a small partition between our rooms and the living room.</p><p>---316---</p><p>The net effect was that I felt I was being unjustly condemned, and more than that, I felt I deserved that condemnation, and I felt guilty, for all the tacit faults, for all the guilt I had committed that had not been formally charged.</p><p>---317---</p><p>Marielina&#39;s story awakened a long-standing restlessness in me. I felt a strong desire to get out, to go out on a limb, to be brave and to move forward. In contrast, what happened to me in Tino seemed too extraordinary. I foresaw that my life was slowly unfolding, but it was nothing more than a virtual existence, an extension of the childhood that had been perfectly intact, so I simply wasted most of my childhood in the Tino family, and I felt that I was a substitute for myself, a substitute life, as if there was a real self that could live there, waiting for the day when I could reunite with this dark, empty self. I felt like a fugitive on an island, an exile from home.</p><p>---318---</p><p>I went out and wandered around the city for a long time, wanting to escape from this hospital, from the collective gasp of people who were sick and dying. I walked through the streets in the dusty sunset, and I could see walls defaced by graffiti, and tin sheds selling goods were squeezed together one by one. I passed through the boy can,I could see some little girls with shit on their heads, some women with charcoal dust all over their faces, cooking rags in huge aluminum drums. I turned left and right in the alleys that led to the pig troughs, as if I was thinking of Wang Nasheng, Wang Nasheng waiting to die in the toilet, and the man who seemed to be a human being in the house. I also thought of Thalia, Thalia sitting on the rocks and looking out to sea. I felt that deep in my heart, there was something that was pulling me away, like the back of a wave pulling me away. I wanted to give in, but it was the only thing that could take me away. I think I can abandon my own destiny and be different from the one I am now, or I can take off everything and throw it away, just like a snake discarding its old skin.</p><p>---319---</p><p>When you chase a kite, you don&#39;t need to look at the shadow of the kite. You can&#39;t chase the shadow of the kite. But you don&#39;t know what I know. Your father is not chasing any shadow, he just knows... ”</p><p>---320---</p><p>Someone woke up in the silence that followed, and I knew that this was a curse that could be cast on me, and I would bear the lie that I told Fengbie for the rest of my life.</p><p>---321---</p><p>Fengbie suddenly realized that he had become the man he had dreamed of for many years: strong, with a big family, well-dressed, well-mannered, stunningly handsome, and rich at a young age. There are other things, not to mention that children can be witty and talk to adults. But in my opinion, the neutron betrayed me. I think the neutron betrayed me, saw through my superficiality, and there was a kind of madness hidden in me.</p><p>---322---</p><p>As the scriptures say, the paradise is under the rivers, and the fruit of my childhood is eternal, and the shadow of my childhood is eternal</p><p>---323---</p><p>I ran because I was a coward. I was afraid of Assef and what he would do to me. I was afraid of getting hurt. That&#39;s what I told myself as I turned my back to the alley, to Hassan. That&#39;s what I made myself believe.</p><p>---324---</p><p>&quot;She said that I was using this to tell you, how can you be so neutron? ”</p><p>“Why are you calling me Neutron World?”</p><p>“Have you fought back?”</p><p>“Get up! Can you hit me!”</p><p>“Have you fought back! Have you fought back, you damned fellow!”</p><p>“You are a coward!”</p><p>“You are nothing but a damned coward!”</p><p>“So, are you satisfied? Do you feel better?”</p><p>“What should I do with you, Hassan? What should I do with you? ”</p><p>From the birthplace of Hassan and Ami</p><p>---325---</p><p>There was an alarm, or something, or the sound of glass breaking, or someone shouting in the house. I heard people waking up from their sleep and running to the street, maybe even wearing pajamas, with dishevelled hair, and half asleep.</p><p>---326---</p><p>The older I get, the less physical needs I have, the quieter my desires, and the more I feel like a child</p><p>---327---</p><p>Dad opened a convenience store To complain about flies in America, you have to sit in the kitchen with a fly swatter and watch them fly from wall to wall, buzzing here and there, flying fast and in a hurry, &quot;In this country, even flies are in a hurry.&quot;</p><p>---328---</p><p>What can a son do to talk back to me? Ami was born in and never saw her. Who do you think you are?</p><p>---329---</p><p>Hassan said, &quot;You are just a person who has never been to a good country and read your hometown books.&quot; &quot;</p><p>---330---</p><p>There are many other things that can be said about you, except for the obvious example of me. The problem is that you can only see black and white. As for what is black and what is white, you have the final say. If you find that you are such a person, if you love him, you must be afraid of him, or even hate him.</p><p>---331---</p><p>Some people are surprised by the strange discovery of the outside world, as if they have never been shocked by the strange discovery.</p><p>---332---</p><p>I think there are some extraterrestrial stories that don&#39;t need to be told.</p><p>---333---</p><p>I hope this is the last in a long series of shameful lies.</p><p>---334---</p><p>When I first saw the ocean, I almost cried. It was so big and so blue. , which was exactly the same as what I saw on the movie screen when I was a child.</p><p>---335---</p><p>When Nana talked about this for many years, she smiled meaningfully. Mariam couldn&#39;t tell whether it was the lingering blame or the unwilling forgiveness.</p><p>---336---</p><p>It might be unfair, but the incident happened in Li, and sometimes it was even a matter of things happening. A little love is enough to change a life.</p><p>---337---</p><p>With the young boys, the few friends in the kite competition, my father and I had a sweet fantasy of getting along with each other in a way that we had never known before. We were fooling ourselves as children, thinking that our toy made of tissue paper, plastic, and bamboo could bridge the gap between us.</p><p>---338---</p><p>The driveway extension that led from the gates to the yard, where Hassan and I took turns falling the summer we learned to ride a bike, didn&#39;t look as wide or as long as I remembered it.</p><p>---339---</p><p>&quot;You may have missed it. Maybe there is no such a good opportunity. &quot;</p><p>We couldn&#39;t have such a good opportunity. She had always considered her birth a great disgrace; her husband&#39;s scandal had left only the last trace, and this was the opportunity for them to erase it once and for all. She found that she was different, because she was a manifestation of their shame, a manifestation of their breathing.</p><p>---340---</p><p>Kabu was born in the summer when it rarely rained, the sky was clear and blue, and the sun burned my neck like an iron.</p><p>---341---</p><p>In a daze, I saw some faces, lingering, but leaving.</p><p>---342---</p><p>&quot;What did you do last time?&quot; &quot;She looked at him and muttered.</p><p>The wind is so convenient now. The perfunctory answer is nonchalant. You are not good at pretending to be a good friend. She looked at you, this couple is not enthusiastic, dancing the old dance of the wind in boredom.</p><p>---343---</p><p>The thick fog from the traffic is stinging my eyes, the noise of the car is giving me a headache, the little one is not, and the pollen is making me cough. Why is the fruit never sweet enough, why is the fruit never clean enough, where have all the trees and fields gone?</p><p>---344---</p><p>It&#39;s so convenient to be with the kite, my thoughts rise and fall with the kite&#39;s home.</p><p>---345---</p><p>I She looked at me and said, &quot;I&#39;m happy. In this world, I want to be the one who can wipe away the sadness.</p><p>---346---</p><p>What does it feel like to have such a deep-rooted consciousness and live in a hierarchical environment for many years?</p><p>---347---</p><p>There are many people who can do whatever they want, except for me, who is an obvious example.</p><p>---348---</p><p>I looked right, left, up, down, and waved my hand in front of my heart, but I couldn&#39;t see anything. I blinked my heart, or I couldn&#39;t see my fingers. Something was wrong with the space. It was too thick, almost solid. The space didn&#39;t do what it should do. It&#39;s solid. I wanted to reach out and crush the air into pieces and stuff them through my tube. The air smelled like gasoline, and the oil stung my eyes, as if someone had cut my skin open and rubbed a lemon on it. My nose burned every time I breathed. I thought I was going to die here. The wind was coming, coming, coming...</p><p>---349---</p><p>This wind was a way of thinking about the way people think they can do it.</p><p>---350---</p><p>A wave of sadness, like the darkness of the window, spread over me, and I felt my throat was choked.</p><p>---351---</p><p>If I continue to tease you and test your loyalty, then you will have to tease me and test my integrity.</p><p>---352---</p><p>Hassan knew. You knew I saw everything that happened in the alley, and knew I stood there and watched. You knew I had betrayed you, but you returned the favor and saved me for the first time, perhaps for the last time.</p><p>---353---</p><p>I would rather die than lie to you</p><p>---354---</p><p>For a while, I felt so sorry for my mistakes and didn&#39;t know what to do with myself. I was more than half a century old, and I couldn&#39;t think of taking care of Suleiman. For many years, I have been confined to the need to find her, and it is not convenient to have someone to accompany me. Now I am free, and I think it is the little place in my heart, but I find that this freedom is just an illusion, because the little place I want to be in my heart no longer exists. People say that you should discover your purpose in life, and then you will return to the purpose you have left. But sometimes, you have to go through life and realize that you already have a purpose in life, maybe this purpose you have never thought of before. Now my purpose has been realized, and I feel that I have become a child once I go back, and I can only go with the flow.</p><p>I found that I couldn&#39;t sleep well in the big room, and I couldn&#39;t stay in front of the room anymore. After Suleiman&#39;s death, I suddenly felt that the house was too big. There were corners, dark places, cracks in the house, no place to hide memories of other things.</p><p>---355---</p><p>(German said)</p><p>She was not aware that she was crying, nor was she aware that she was crying.</p><p>A verse from a song that they used to sing suddenly floated to her tongue:</p><p>I know the sad fairy,</p><p>The evening wind blew it away.</p><p>There was another verse, and before this moment, she was not sure whether it would escape with her.</p><p>Pari sat down. She had to sit down. At this moment, she knew that she could not stand up. She waited for the coffee to be ready, thinking, she would have a cup of coffee, a cigarette or a drink, and she went to the living room to see if she could find Collet and see if they could arrange a trip to Kabul.</p><p>But now, Pari just sat there talking. The coffee machine gurgled and she closed her eyes. Through the curtains, she saw the soft hills, the blue sky behind the house, the sunset falling into the mill</p><p>---356---</p><p>I just want to tell you, I am a venomous snake in the bushes and a monster at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>---357---</p><p>When my piggy bank is broken………………I will smash it open, put all the money in it, and go to find my beloved sister. No matter where she is, I will buy it back and bring her home to see Baba. I hope she will make me happy. In this life, I want to be the one who can wipe away my sadness.</p><p>…</p><p>Baba?</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Is she a good sister?</p><p>She is the best sister.</p><p>She kissed my face and tucked the blanket around my neck, then went to the door, turned off the light, and stopped outside.</p><p>She is the best. She said, just like you.</p><p>I wanted to say goodbye, and when I closed the door, I would sneak out of the house, grab a pillow, and put it on my pillow. When I fell asleep at night, I could feel your heart beating in my chest.</p><p>---358---</p><p>I have to remind you that we are brothers who have grown up drinking the same milk, and this kind of love cannot be separated even by time.</p><p>Hassan and I drank the same milk. We took our first steps on the same lawn in the same yard. When we were little, under the same roof, we said our first word.</p><p>I said &quot;Dad&quot;.</p><p>I said &quot;Ami was born here&quot;. My name.</p><p>Looking back now, the extraterrestrial incident that I thought occurred in the winter of 1975 - and all extraterrestrial incidents that followed in the United States - had their roots in these words.---359---</p><p>&quot;My Lord, Ami is here, Master, there are ghosts outside, it&#39;s just a good day.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are ghosts outside.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are ghosts outside.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you sure? Today is a good day, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s go and fly a kite.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s go and fly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay!&quot;</p><p>From Hassan and Ami&#39;s words</p><p>---360---</p><p>It&#39;s been six years since I saw it rain so brightly, in a faded Polaroid photo.</p><p>---361---</p><p>The newly cleared snow on the street was silvery, and the sky was blue and impeccable.</p><p>---362---</p><p>I have been trying to persuade Salia to this day. I know she will not accept it. But now I understand. She was right—she was right. I can’t pretend to know how she got through all that, years of staring at a face in the mirror, taking the horrific damage and then mustering the courage to accept it. It took the weight of the burden, the effort, the perseverance. Her acceptance was slow, accumulated over years, like waves that carve rocks on the coast. It only took a few minutes to create a face like this, and she knew it would take her a lifetime to create a new one. She couldn’t let me use the scalpel to make it all go away. It seemed like she was cutting into the old wound, but it was opening a new one.</p><p>---363---</p><p>I had to stop, turn around, and say, &quot;For you, a thousand times!&quot; I smiled Hassan-like and walked out of the street corner.</p><p>---364---</p><p>In Afghanistan, the ending is the most important thing.</p><p>What we want to know is whether it is a happy ending.</p><p>After all, life is not an Indian movie. Afghans</p><p>like to say: life is good or good. We don&#39;t care about the beginning or the end, success or failure, danger or light, just like the nomads, moving slowly and dusty.</p><p>---365---</p><p>When I arrived in Kabul, I found that Hassan had no intention of moving. &quot;But all these houses are not worth living in. After all, Hassan, I hope someone can live there,&quot; I said.</p><p>But she didn&#39;t listen. She said it was about respect. She and Farzana moved to the old house in the courtyard, where she lived for many years. I asked her to move to the guest room on the top floor, but Hassan didn&#39;t listen to her at all. &quot;What will Ami think if she lives in the house?&quot; she said to me. &quot;She thinks it&#39;s the end of the fight. What will she think if Ami lives in the house and she comes back one day and finds me in her place?&quot; Then, Hassan wore 40 black clothes to commemorate your death.</p><p>---366---</p><p>I became who I am today on a cold, overcast winter day in 1975, when I was a different person.</p><p>---367---</p><p>When Tashik straightened his back and stood on one leg, the others suddenly realized what was going on. Kadim jumped over and scolded him, untied his leg and carried it on his shoulder like a sword.</p><p>The men hurriedly opened their mouths. They asked for a way out between Tashik and Kadim.</p><p>Then there was dust flying, punching and kicking, crying and begging for mercy.</p><p>Kadim had to stop bullying me.</p><p>---368---</p><p>I paused, then said, &quot;You and I grew up with the same woman&#39;s milk.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You...how did you tell me about us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You said you were my best friend in life.&quot; I said.</p><p>---369---</p><p>I really think I&#39;m such a person. If you love me, you must be very afraid of me, and even hate me.</p><p>---370---</p><p>But when I called you, I felt that there was an empty hole in my heart. I have been living with Salia for many years. It has been several years since we last met. To me, this period of time is a dark and vast blank. I was missing it. Missing the meals that Thalia and I had shared at this table for years, missing the laughter, the arguments, the long boredom, the screams, the long string of simple rituals that make up a person&#39;s life. It was a bit confusing to enter my childhood home, it was like a novel that I had read the beginning so long ago, put away for a while, and now eagerly read the end.</p><p>---371---</p><p>A bad penny always turns up.</p><p>---372---</p><p>It&#39;s about these little things, because history is not easy to change, and neither is religion. After all, I am a Pashtun, but I am a Hazara, I am a Sunni, but I am a Shia, and there is nothing that can change these things. There is.</p><p>---373---</p><p>For you, I&#39;ve done it a thousand times. I can&#39;t be a good person again.</p><p>---374---</p><p>The trees where Hassan and I used to climb and shine mirror-like light through our house are now sparsely leafed. The corn is still there, and I can see the corn, which is still healthy. The paint is peeling, and in some places it has fallen off in pieces.</p><p>The grass is brown, the same color as the dust that hangs over the city, and there are patches of bare soil where nothing can grow.</p><p>---375---</p><p>For the first time, Mariam can use Nana&#39;s ears to hear her. Now she could clearly hear the hypocrisy of the person who was hiding something, could clearly hear the falseness of her comfort, she felt sorry for the fact that she had to speak out.</p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>…She could feel the weight of the neutron&#39;s heart light looking down at her from the upstairs window.</p><p>---376---</p><p>We were hovering on the dangerous edge of gossip, the venomous tongue was gossiping, and it was she who was poisoned by the gossip, not me - I could not tell the double standards of the Afghans, and most of them were men, so I took advantage of everything.</p><p>---377---</p><p>And this is what I want you to understand, that good, read good, was born out of your father&#39;s remorse.</p><p>---378---</p><p>My face was burning, and a sense of guilt surged in my heart. I felt guilty about it, and my past was paid with ulcers, black nails, and sore wrists. I had to stick to my own ideas, and I decided. I didn&#39;t want to sacrifice myself for my father. This was the last time, and I cursed myself.</p><p>---379---</p><p>It was just a little thing, and it was all I could do. It was all I could do. It was all I could do. It was all I could do. It was just a little thing, a tiny thing, like a leaf on a tree, shaking in the wind as a startled bird flew away.</p><p>I welcomed it with open arms. It was the arrival of spring, the first snowflake that melted for many years; it was also the first snowflake that I had just seen melting.</p><p>---380---</p><p>If you take things from outside, you will see them as pitiful. You will not see anything different.</p><p>---381---</p><p>Etienne Bouroullec: Maybe this is her way of thinking about rebellion. I think you know a thing or two about rebellion.</p><p>Nie&#39;erjie Wahli: Of course. But I am a real rebel. I drink and smoke and fall in love. Who would rebel against the world?</p><p>She thinks that the big and small are together</p><p>Nie&#39;erjie Wahli: Little is, she thinks that this is the kind of rebellion that people say is against each other. We have given her all the freedom she wants. She wants what she wants. She has everything she needs. She can live with her husband now. He was much older than she thought, charming to an extreme, witty, and funny. He was a man who had no doubts about anything, a narcissist with an ego the size of Poland.</p><p>Etienne Bouroullec: You don&#39;t agree.</p><p>Nigel Vahli: I don&#39;t agree. This is France, Monsieur Bouroullec, not Afghanistan. Young men don&#39;t have to live or die by the grace of the state.</p><p>---382---</p><p>It is best for one to have a certain degree of humility and tolerance when judging another&#39;s behavior.</p><p>---383---</p><p>The decent reciprocity is to understand, not to rush to judge. Even to repay evil with good.</p><p>---384---</p><p>I can wade through this world, my sins sinking to the deepest part, and the neutrons can make me feel that there are ghosts and sins outside.</p><p>---385---</p><p>It is the way of things. It is so close to you. Five years have passed, and my child&#39;s world has already brought back the original life of time: the wind of time is like the accordion of the Pashtun songs of the ancient times, which can stretch and shrink my child&#39;s world, and my heart depends on whether the Pashtun songs are on her or not.</p><p>---386---</p><p>When Mariam thought of this seed, her heart suddenly swelled, it swelled, it swelled, it swelled, it thought that all the failures in her life, all the sadness, all the loneliness, all the self-blame, were gone. It was the wind that had brought her across thousands of atoms to this place. Now she knew this place. She remembered that God had taught her a verse from the Qur&#39;an: God is in the world, ... She clasped her hands before her, begging me to speak.</p><p>---387---</p><p>For all these little things, history is not easy to change, and neither is religion.</p><p>---388---</p><p>When she mentioned the first husband, I noticed a shadow fall over her face for the first time since I had seen her, like a brief hint of something dark, punitive, traumatic, so different from her cheerful and charming demeanor, and not worthy of her loose, pumpkin-flowered skirt. I think I was thinking at the time that she must be a good actor, so she can use her happiness to express her feelings, to disguise my desire and pain. The wind is like a mask, I think, secretly saying that she is very proud of her wonderful association.</p><p>---389---</p><p>Creative meaning is that wind destroys the life of others, making them unwilling and unwitting participants. You steal your desires, your dreams, your flaws, your pain. You take things that do not belong to you. You are deliberately giving them away.</p><p>---390---</p><p>I want to tell you that books are not good enough for me, and they are gifts that I do not deserve.</p><p>---391---</p><p>Based on my experience, a man like you who understands women very well doesn&#39;t seem to want to have anything to do with women.</p><p>---392---</p><p>Karin opened the door and saw the broken stairs leading to the basement. A damp and smelly smell like mold was coming out.</p><p>---393---</p><p>&quot;Ah, the little girl.&quot; The girl said, &quot;It&#39;s all good. People in this difficult time don&#39;t need to distract her from the hard times.&quot;</p><p>---394---</p><p>(II) Continued</p><p>So I chose this major. I wanted to divide the advantages equally among the people of Salia. I used my scalpel to correct the injustices that were deliberately created. I found it shameful that the order was a tiny resistance from the heart. Under this order, a dog bite, a little girl&#39;s future was taken away. She was abandoned and became the target of discrimination.</p><p>---395---</p><p>I came here to live. Amy was born in a good place. There are ghosts outside. It&#39;s just a good life.</p><p>---396---</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? You&#39;re not healthy,&quot; Khadija said finally, breaking the silence. &quot;She&#39;s not the same anymore. What are you going to do? You&#39;re a burden to your family.&quot;</p><p>Don&#39;t say it like you&#39;re a burden to us now. Mariam almost heard the unspoken words come out of Khadija&#39;s mouth, like a misty breath on a cold day.</p><p>---397---</p><p>But when the numbing medicine wore off later that night, it felt like someone had pressed a red hot coal to my loins.</p><p>---398---</p><p>The beauty of women, especially beautiful women like you, is a delicate and inconvenient world for me. It is like a starling in your hand. Once you let go, it will fly away.</p><p>---399---</p><p>&quot;We are the sad tribe, we are Afghans, right?&quot;</p><p>---400---</p><p>I never slept the night before the tournament. I&#39;d roll from side to side, make shadow animals on the wall, even sit on the balcony in the dark, a blanket wrapped around me.</p><p>---401---</p><p>Wars were waged, the Internet was invented, and a robot had rolled on the surface of Mars, and in Afghanistan we were still telling Mullah Nasruddin jokes.</p><p>---402---</p><p>Where do I belong when I was in Afghanistan? What do I do now?</p><p>I am everything you have ever had, Mariam, and now I am different from you. You have nothing else. You have nothing else.</p><p>---403---</p><p>When the snow melted and the spring rain continued, Kabuki&#39;s fingers, which had grown for many years, had some cross-cut wounds on them, which turned out to be the evidence of a winter of kite fighting.</p><p>---404---</p><p>(I)</p><p>&quot;Abdul, what are you talking about?&quot; Pari asked.</p><p>&quot;Nothing.&quot; She muttered.</p><p>&quot;No, you&#39;re singing—what are you singing?&quot;</p><p>She turned her head to look at me, with a look of helplessness on her face. She didn&#39;t know.</p><p>&quot;It seems to be a famous song.&quot; I said, &quot;Did you sing it when you were a child, Baba? You said you sang it when you were a child. You said you also taught it to you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you sing this for us?&quot; Pari asked eagerly, and Sikko choked for a moment. &quot;Please, Abdul, sing it, please?&quot;</p><p>He lowered his head and shook his head slowly.</p><p>&quot;Sing it, Baba.&quot; I said, and put my hand on his bony shoulder. &quot;Good, good ... ---406---</p><p>At the corner of the lake, a truck staggered past, its mirror emitting glittering sunlight.</p><p>---407---</p><p>The selfless loyalty of life, like a kite with a broken string that I had chased before, has returned to its original state, and it is floating in the air.</p><p>---408---</p><p>&quot;Do you like kites?&quot; I held up the horizontal axis of the kite. My eyes fell on me, looking at the kite, but I was looking away. A few raindrops dripped from my hair and flowed down my face.</p><p>---409---</p><p>Soraya&#39;s silence is not from the wisdom of the outside world, but from the self-confidence of the outside world. It is because he chose to remain silent to uphold his beliefs and protest, but he was also because he chose to accept the darkness of life. He seemed to be afraid of leaving footprints, and he didn&#39;t want to stir up the surrounding air when he moved. When he was out, he chose to sleep.</p><p>---410---</p><p>I wish Soraya were there with me.</p><p>---411---</p><p>People say that this is either a so-called violence against others. A so-called murder against others. As if you can commit a so-called, wise murder.</p><p>---412---</p><p>&quot;You will definitely find her next to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll think of the difference between us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll make it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Forever.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay, forever.&quot;</p><p>She turned to the front of the car and said, &quot;Promise, Apo, I&#39;ll be there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Forever, forever.&quot;</p><p>---413---</p><p>To be honest, this is the meaning of the Holy Child. Sacrifice. You sacrifice your hands and feet, your vision, and even your life, but you sacrifice with joy. To be honest, the Holy Child can give you some rights, and you don&#39;t get them because you have to use them to make the best use of them. Those who sacrifice themselves will get the best return. This life is like this, and the next life will be the same.</p><p>---414---</p><p>This moment is fleeting, barely enough to make my heart tremble, but it is long enough for me to consciously look at my illusory self and meet the woman who is looking back at the window in my childhood.</p><p>---415---</p><p>For me, writing is either to serve myself or to tell my past to myself.</p><p>---416---</p><p>Time is not good, and I try my best to make up for it. Isn’t it a kind of self-salvation?</p><p>---417---</p><p>People say that people who grow up with the same chest are brothers.</p><p>---418---</p><p>I guess, too, as the memory of her face faded into the shadows, as the years passed, her memories of it began to fade, to flow away, like sand in her hand. She was becoming a ghost with flesh and blood, an empty shell that she had to fill with imaginary details and fabricated personalities, even if the memories were fabricated, it seemed that she had forgotten them completely.</p><p>---419---</p><p>Cut off a finger, and you can&#39;t save your hand.</p><p>---420---</p><p>This life is like this, and the next life will be the same</p><p>---421---</p><p>I was thinking, I read in a book that sea neutrons smell like salt, can we tell?</p><p>---422---</p><p>La tua ragazza? She looked at something else. She found a photo of Salia on the beach, which I took with my homemade pinhole camera many years ago. &quot;Your girlfriend?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; I said.</p><p>&quot;Your sister?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p><p>&quot;La tua cugina? (your cousin), si (really)?&quot;</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>She looked at the photo carefully, took a few puffs, and finished her cigarette. &quot;No,&quot; she said with gritted teeth, and to my surprise, she was even more angry. &quot;Questa e la tua ragazza! (This girl is your girlfriend). I know, you are a big liar!&quot; Then she said goodbye. I thought I couldn&#39;t believe it. She pressed the lighter and clicked on the photo.</p><p>---423---</p><p>Hassan was either right or wrong about this idea. If I really wanted her to be with me, I would definitely want her to be with me, and I would have no choice but to refuse.</p><p>---424---</p><p>I didn&#39;t know whether Ade was right or not. Most likely, she would accept it because of the same reason as me: because she couldn&#39;t bear the fate.</p><p>---425---</p><p>&quot;It seems that Hassan is with us now, so let&#39;s go somewhere else.&quot;</p><p>---426---</p><p>Returning to Kabul was like visiting a long-lost friend. I felt miserable and sad, and I felt that I could not go home and I could not get more money.</p><p>---427---</p><p>Abdul thought that I had played on the swing and was a grown-up like Abdul, who was always worried, hanging around, and running around with other children. After ten days, there were scars all over my hands and lines of fatigue on my face. Ten people have to use it, and it is like being born with a shovel, and being able to see through the dirt with a fingernail.</p><p>---428---</p><p>When the evil deeds have a good result, the people are redeemed</p><p>---429---</p><p>For the outside world, it is like this, until the country is good and the outside world comes back.</p><p>---430---</p><p>We know very little about this barbaric, cruel, and violent behavior.</p><p>---431---</p><p>It is just the outside world of those who want to be the heart and those who don&#39;t want to be the heart.</p><p>---432---</p><p>Be grateful for the sky, be grateful for the light, and be grateful for some things.</p><p>---433---</p><p>The guilt and remorse that had been there for so long stung me again, as if the spell had been lifted, and they were freed and tormented me again.</p><p>---434---</p><p>We succumbed to defeat and disaster, and took these as a natural part of life, even as a necessity.</p><p>---435---</p><p>The wise Lord also saw through our various shortcomings, and among my many shortcomings, the most serious one was that I had the power to reject you first, and then the love of Mariam.</p><p>---436---</p><p>For many years, I have been grateful for the good things that have happened to me. I have said something to you, not because I am afraid of death, but because my wife still has a husband and my children do not become lonely.</p><p>---437---</p><p>&quot;Forget it, you have to go down.&quot; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;Go down.&quot;</p><p>---438---</p><p>Looking at this house, for the first time, I felt the loneliness that I feared, and the unbearable emptiness that I could not bear.</p><p>---439---</p><p>Naranfa raised his gray eyebrows like a foreigner: &quot;Really? Lucky Haza, I am a child of this world. I am so caring. I will kneel down in front of you and wipe the dust off your boots with my eyelashes.&quot;</p><p>---440---</p><p>After the family returned, the city returned to the city, the veins returned to the mountains, the mountains returned to the veins, and all these returned to the city, and there were more cities and more people.</p><p>---441---</p><p>For me, Kabwa has become a ghost city, a city haunted by the ghost of a cleft lip.</p><p>---442---</p><p>America is different. America is a river, rushing forward, and the world is full of people. I can use this great river to make my sins sink to the deepest part, and let the river flow through me for many years, and let the world have ghosts, the world has children, and the world has sins. The wind is not a child, but for this reason alone, I will embrace America.</p><p>---443---</p><p>Like a grown man, I burst into tears when my impeccable logic overwhelmed me.</p><p>---444---</p><p>I have the final say on what is black and what is white.</p><p>---445---</p><p>For the first time in my life, I longed for spring to come sooner.</p><p>---446---</p><p>I wondered when I had the ability to cause this kind of pain.</p><p>---447---</p><p>Everything was so good, and I even believed that this good thing would never last.</p><p>---448---</p><p>Dad&#39;s other half, the one with a good name, a good name, and a right, the one who inherited Dad&#39;s pure and noble qualities, and perhaps, had been secretly in Dad&#39;s heart for many years, and this was the one who had to be treated as his own.</p><p>---449---</p><p>Since I woke up from that night, I have suffered from insomnia.</p><p>---450---</p><p>“Parfois je pense que tu es mon seul ami ” (Sometimes I feel like you are my only friend.)</p><p>---451---</p><p>If you really are my friend, and you are killed in the blood, your reputation will be damaged. This is because of your tyranny. You hold the token of the first ten warriors, and I will repay you with love and call you a different name. Since you can’t change your heart, I have wasted my words and now I will die...</p><p>---452---</p><p>“I think the wind is not as violent as Hassan’s family.” I said to myself. Dad is dreaming and turning over, and Uncle Homayong is talking nonsense. A part of me is thirstyI hope someone wakes up to listen to me, so that I don&#39;t have to live with the lie of separation. I hope someone wakes up, and in the silence that follows, I know that this is a spell that will be cast on me, and I will never live with the lie of separation again.</p><p>---453---</p><p>I am ashamed that we have tried to hide the separation from you all these years. You have the right to know, and so does Hassan. I know how hard you were on me when you were growing up. I know how much pain you suffered. How much you longed for your love, and I feel for you. I hope you are a man who is half of my child, and I am ashamed that you and Hassan are both. I love you, but I can&#39;t show my love for Hassan openly, because I have the right to do so. So I can vent my resentment on you - you are the opposite, you are half of the inheritance of the society, you have all the inherited wealth, and the right to impunity for crimes that come with the society, all of which are given to you by the society. When I see you, I see myself, I will feel guilty. I have done this for myself, and then I will do it with the love of the society. When sin leads to good deeds, it is natural that the wind will not come, and it is natural that it can be saved by the Lord. ---454---</p><p>&quot;May the world bless you.&quot;</p><p>---455---</p><p>I got out of the car and parked in front of the bookstore. This walk in the driveway felt like the longest journey in my life. I opened the door and got in the car immediately. With shaking hands, I opened the book again. The handwriting was not a signature. She saw that I had written a sentence in English.</p><p>I closed the book and my eyes. I thought I was done, but there was a part of me that had been hoping to tell my story for many years. Maybe she looked disdainful and said something childish about my hatred and disgust for me. Maybe it was an outpouring of resentment. Maybe it had returned the good of Germany. On the contrary, she felt that I was falling, as if I had lost my temper. The little girl left a message saying, &quot;I can&#39;t worry about you, I have you.&quot; Good intentions will not do the same. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that it was charity. I should feel relieved. But it hurt me. I felt its blow, like an axe falling on my head.</p><p>---456---</p><p>In the previous one, for me, He Shi had become a kind of alien, like a character in the play. The world that connected us had been worn away. This unexpected relationship was purely an accident in the hospital. The attack was so urgent, but the pain was so strong that it has now turned into a chronic ulcer. This experience has gone to the place of other things. I realized that the strong determination I once fell into was just an illusion, a delusion... a terrible misjudgment of my own strength, will and character. Some extramarital affairs are best forgotten, and I have to deal with them in the best possible way.</p><p>---457---</p><p>The impact of the main voice is that your upper lip is split into two halves, or the philtrum is split. Or the philtrum is split, like a cleft lip.</p><p>---458---</p><p>(I) After using it on the campus, we are still separated, so we said. I heard some girls screaming. They were rushing through the crowd like a bowling ball, rolling through a pile of wooden bottles, but she looked like she was dragging Salia. She pushed and shoved her way to a corner of the campus, where there was a bench. She climbed onto the bench, dragged Salia up with her, and blew a whistle. The campus was almost silent.</p><p>&quot;She saw Thalia Janakko,&quot; she said, &quot;or she will...&quot; She paused, &quot;No matter who is calling, shut up, I won&#39;t let you do anything. Now, Thalia Janakko is a member of our school. I hope you will treat her with courtesy and politeness. If I hear that someone said something inappropriate, I will find you and make her regret it. You know I will never do this again. I won&#39;t tell you this again.&quot;</p><p>---459---</p><p>I can&#39;t say that when my father&#39;s car drove away, I found someone who said my name as the first word in his life. I caught my last vague glimpse of Hassan, slumped in his chair, and then my father turned the corner, the same place we had played marbles against each other for years.</p><p>I stepped back and looked around to see only the rain on the windowpanes, which looked like molten silver.</p><p>---460---</p><p>Now, no matter what the world says, there is only one crime, only one. It is theft, and it is not the same kind of theft. Do you understand?</p><p>---461---</p><p>I turned my head and looked at Pari. &quot;Do you know what this means?&quot;</p><p>Pari&#39;s chin trembled and she shook her head slowly. She took the tea box from my hand and examined it carefully. &quot;No.&quot; Xiaokan wanted to say, &quot;When Abdu and I broke up, the hurt we suffered was much more serious. I was more fortunate than him because I was young, and this protected me. I was able to enjoy forgetting. But not later.&quot; Xiaokan wanted to pick up a feather, rubbed it against his wrist, and stared at it, as if hoping it would wake up and fly. &quot;I don&#39;t know what this feather means, nor do I know its meaning, but I know it means that you miss me. You have been missing me for so many years. You miss me.&quot; Xiaokan wanted to cry, and I hugged Xiaokan&#39;s shoulders.</p><p>---462---</p><p>(II)</p><p>The hut was connected to the house. I saw clotheslines; women squatting in the stream; a long rope swaying back and forth under a tree; a big dog cowered at the teasing of a group of village children; a hook-nosed man digging a ditch, his shirt soaked with sweat and sticking to his face; a veiled woman bent over and felt something.</p><p>In this way, in all this, almost out of my fantasy and what I had realized, I began to say what I wanted to say, and I finally lingered. An elusive shadow. A human figure. Soft, hard, these feelings accompanied me. Soft was a hand that held my hand. Hard was a knee that I had rested my face on. She searched for the creature&#39;s face, but every time she looked at it, it dodged, slipped out of her sight. Pari felt a hole in her heart. Her life, her entire life, had always been filled with a huge sense of loss. Somehow, she still felt this sense of loss.</p><p>&quot;Brother,&quot; she wanted to say.</p><p>---463---</p><p>We spent our childhood in silence, and you had to tell us that you had to talk to us every day, and we had to talk to each other every time we spent our lives together - those people who knew each other and grew up drinking the same milk as her.</p><p>---464---</p><p>(1) I dreamed that I was standing on the top of an orchard, watching the willow trees being beaten with sticks. The iron rods rose and fell, and the iron rods made a sound when they hit the flesh and bones. I woke up from these dreams, and when I woke up, I felt a cry of grief locked in my chest. At any time, I cried as if my ribs were hit hard.</p><p>But.</p><p>But.</p><p>What can be done is what can be done. What is new is that the wind has disappeared from my mind, and the wind has slowly found a companion. Another is that the wind has appeared, resisting the current of consciousness that has now run through my heart, and it has replaced the former wind, which is just the space that I have been looking for. I realized its awakening, which is the part that I have only just gained, and it is also the part that bothers me the most. As time goes by, this part of me gradually fades away, and I can&#39;t help but accept this new departure. At this moment, it feels like a wet sweater, and I feel stinging. I finally saw that I might have started to accept it. At first, I took it as a child, but now I have more tolerance.</p><p>---465---</p><p>(I)</p><p>Through the window, Xiao Kanxiang saw a familiar scene: a narrow cobblestone street, a drugstore on the side of the street, a small shop selling fried bean balls on the corner, and a beer house owned by a Pakistani man.</p><p>Pari&#39;s hands were shaking. Something amazing had happened to Xiao Kanxiang. Something very unexpected. Xiao Kanxiang had a picture in his mind of an axe chopping at the soil and suddenly, thick black oil gushed out of the ground. This was the same thing that had happened to Xiao Kanxiang, and it touched his memory that year, rising from his deepest thoughts. I wanted to look out the window and stare at the young man in the beer house, but what I wanted to see was not the shop assistant under the awning, skinny, with a black apron tied around his waist, shaking the tablecloth, but a red cart with creaking wheels, bouncing under the long clouds, over the mountains, climbing through the dry valleys, up and down in the earth-colored fields, the scenery gradually emerged, and the wind gradually disappeared. I wanted to see the fruit trees, leaning on my shoulders in the garden, the leaves blocked the breeze, and I saw the vines behind and the peaks of the trees.</p><p>---466---</p><p>The wind also has a conscience, the wind also has virtues, and people do not suffer. I hope that this time when you go to Afghanistan, you can put an end to your suffering.</p><p>---467---</p><p>Perhaps in some future life, someone, for some reason, decided to deprive me of my right to be a human being, in retaliation for what I had done. Perhaps it was my revenge, perhaps it was sin.</p><p>---468---</p><p>If I had learned anything in Kabul, it was that human life was chaotic, unpredictable, and had nothing to do with the symmetry of life. But I also found comfort in the belief that the patterns of my life, my life story, would take shape, like a photograph in a darkroom, slowly revealing itself, to confirm the good I had always wanted to see in myself. This story also supported me.</p><p>---469---</p><p>Perhaps at some point near dawn, I fell asleep. I dreamed of Hassan running in the snow, his green robe dragging on the ground, his black rubber boots squeaking under the snow. He waved his arms: for you, thousands and thousands of times!</p><p>---470---</p><p>&quot;Give me your hands, Otti,&quot; said Salia, &quot;quickly!&quot;</p><p>She opened her hands, palms facing outward. Salia reached into her pocket and pulled out a piece of ivory-shaped carved glass. She took it and placed it on her palm. Suddenly, many small ivory-shaped rainbows appeared around her, trembling on the wrinkled skin under my hands. She also began to breathe heavily.</p><p>&quot;Look, Cheng Ke is flying!&quot; he said, looking very happy, he was so happy, not embarrassed at all, he felt like a little girl. I have never seen Cheng Ke so pure and so scheming before.</p><p>We sat down, the three of us, looking at the little rainbow trembling in my hand, I felt sad, and the pain in my heart was like a claw, strangling my throat.</p><p>---471---</p><p>There was a little kite hanging in the sky, like a paper shark, patrolling and hunting for food. In less than an hour, the year doubled, and red, blue, and purple kites flew back and forth in the sky, shining brightly.</p><p>---472---</p><p>Children were playing in the corridor, chasing each other up and down. The air in the corridor smelled of chili chickpeas, and there was a stench of animal manure and sweat.</p><p>---473---</p><p>Dad was the only man I had ever known. I was his legitimate half, and I was his legitimate and legal half, unconsciously acting as the embodiment of his guilt. I looked at Hassan, not only Dad&#39;s other half, but also his legitimate and legal half, and the half that inherited Dad&#39;s pure and noble qualities.</p><p>---474---</p><p>(I) Many years ago, when I started to receive plastic surgery training, I realized that I was beginning to understand something. I looked at my child in the kitchen, and when I left Tino for the month, I went to boarding school. I realized that this world can&#39;t see your inner self, it doesn&#39;t care about your hopes, dreams, and sorrows, they are like the wind in the moon.Skin and bones conceal everything. It&#39;s so simple, so absurd, so cruel. I&#39;ve learned this from my own experience. We&#39;ve seen that much of who we are, or may be, depends on the symmetry of our skeleton, the distance between our faces and our bodies, the length of our chins, the angle of our noses, and whether we have a nice nose-frontal bone.</p><p>Beauty is a great gift, both unexpected and stupid.</p><p>---475---</p><p>Pari lay in her bed, naked, her eyes closed, her heart pounding, intoxicated, a buzzing sensation spreading through her chest, her belly, and out as soon as it came out.</p><p>---476---</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t want to crush you.&quot;</p><p>Finally there was a lie - the last thing I had to say - but it was a white lie. You want to know that you want to crush me. You want to know that I also know. I am not here, I have been thousands of miles away from home and have never been able to get it. All the unhappiness, the labor, the hard work, the years when Salia ran away. But it can be said that I am gone, and she has given me a reward that I don&#39;t deserve and I don&#39;t want.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t start with that.&quot; I said, not even after you have been a child.</p><p>---477---</p><p>(II) Continued</p><p>Pari Vahi suddenly said something in such a big voice, which sounded like a cry from the bottom of her throat, and Xiao Kan covered her mouth. &quot;Oh my God.&quot; Xiao Kan lowered her head and sang in a wave-like voice:</p><p>I know the sad fairy,</p><p>The evening wind blew it away.</p><p>---478---</p><p>I want to bring you closer, hug you, and tell you that I have been unkind to you, and you have never chosen me.</p><p>The man&#39;s face twisted and tensed, trying to keep calm: &quot;Dad, you can&#39;t say that it&#39;s wrong to hurt bad people. You don&#39;t know what&#39;s good. Sometimes you can&#39;t do it. Bad people are good for me.&quot;</p><p>---479---</p><p>&quot;Have you seen the teeth of that girl? They are like tombstones. If you look down on your mouth, you will be buried in a grave.&quot;</p><p>---480---</p><p>It&#39;s fate to look down on you. What choice do I have? I know you can&#39;t escape your birth consciousness, just like Jiang and Mu can&#39;t escape their birth consciousness. People say that I was born with the most difficult things. I didn&#39;t say that. This is my birth consciousness. This is its learning. This is not the moon that is walking west. This is not the moon that is walking west. Even if it is not the beginning, it is still incomprehensible.</p><p>---481---</p><p>When I say goodbye to my beloved Ami, I say, &quot;For you, thousands and thousands of times.&quot;</p><p>---482---</p><p>If a man is so young, he can only be called a brave man.</p><p>---483---</p><p>The little boy wanted to look up, but he couldn&#39;t. Tears were streaming down his face. He grinned and said, &quot;It seems that only the little boy Abdu has stood here, and he can be away from all disasters. Abdu just clenched his hand. You see, at night, when I fell asleep in the crib with my sister, I clasped my hands, entangled my feet, and touched my head.</p><p>---484---</p><p>You are just wasting your time. I smiled at Hassan, opened my hands, and stood there waiting for him.</p><p>---485---</p><p>Hassan and Ami are my children. For you, thousands of times</p><p>---486---</p><p>Xiao Kan wanted to say that when I was young, I was like my father, but I was not casual or vague, and I could find comfort in my family. Although I knew the answers were difficult to solve, I knew they were still big enough for him to find out. They were waiting in my heart for so long that I finally took out a small piece of chalk and scribbled them out.</p><p>&quot;What you mean is that it is completely different from the awakening.&quot; The man said, &quot;The awakening questions are not answers, but there are too many answers and I can&#39;t figure them out.&quot;</p><p>---487---</p><p>Catch the fire-breathing monster! After we swam in the grass, I dragged the wooden cart behind me, surrounded by apple and cherry trees, which looked like a towering skyscraper in the sky, with people&#39;s heads bigger than thousands of windows, vying to see the wonders below.</p><p>---488---</p><p>I was like a soldier trying to sleep in the trench on the eve of the great storm.</p><p>---489---</p><p>When I was born, it was not the first adult I considered a friend.</p><p>---490---</p><p>In the past, I slept under bridges. In Brussels, I slept in hostels. Sometimes I splurge, find a nice hotel, rent a room, take a hot shower, shave, and wear a bathrobe. I watch color TV. The cities, roads, villages, and people I met all blur together. I tell myself I&#39;m looking for something. But a growing feeling tells me I&#39;m wandering, waiting for something to happen when I leave, something that will change everything, something that I&#39;ve spent all my life preparing for.</p><p>---491---</p><p>One patted my shoulder, &quot;Welcome back.&quot; One said sadly.</p><p>---492---</p><p>Afghan men, especially those who came from this prestigious family, are like opportunists. They often say a few words to me, and often slander me when I was young. They look at me like a frightened bird and run away.</p><p>---493---</p><p>Now I understand why those men are not interested in watches. They are not looking at watches at all, they are looking at my food.</p><p>---494---</p><p>Ten years since he&#39;d returned from Paris and he was still showing those stupid slides.</p><p>---495---</p><p>That evening, we went to Chaman Boulevard, Mariam stood on the street where Sid had left, and watched the fireworks light up the night sky, emitting green, pink, and purple lights. I remembered that I had sat in the mud house with Fasu and watched the fireworks explode in the sky above them, and those sudden explosions of fireworks were reflected in my soft and misty eyes. But you, I miss Nana the most. Mariam hoped that she would be able to see this moment. To see herself in it all. To see the beauty and the beauty that you could never get. Things are worth a lot to people like us.</p><p>---496---</p><p>My son looked at my backpack. &quot;What backpack?&quot; the child said coldly. Everything I had was gone—my clothes, my money, my books, my camera. &quot;The thief left this for you,&quot; the child said in a gibberish voice, pointing to the windowsill next to me. It was the picture. I picked it up. Thalia, long hair flying in the wind, white waves rolling around, bare feet on the rocks, the Aegean Sea rising up in front of and behind me. My throat choked. I didn&#39;t want to die here, among these strangers, so far away from me. I inserted the photo into the glass and the window frame.</p><p>---497---</p><p>The black boy glared at me and said, &quot;Don&#39;t beg for mercy if you kneel down and learn from the devil!&quot;</p><p>---498---</p><p>Hassan didn&#39;t refuse me and didn&#39;t let me have the ability to love him when he was young</p><p>---499---</p><p>She had a typical black film face, a face that was most suitable for black and white films. The blinds moved and cast a shadow on her face. A wisp of cigarette smoke curled up beside her face. There was a strand of hair, like a parenthesis, hanging precisely on the tip of her brow, very elegant, perhaps too elegant. Although in fact the strand of hair had fallen by accident, Pari noticed that she was unwilling to raise her hand and put it on me.</p><p>---500---</p><p>&quot;You know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Know what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I only like you.&quot;</p><p>---501---</p><p>Suddenly, in this moment, I felt that I was connected to this ancient land by blood...</p><p>---502---</p><p>I was so big that I couldn&#39;t see him through the mirror, and he didn&#39;t see me either, looking at me with the most lonely look under me.</p><p>---503---</p><p>Hassan was crying. Ah Xiang couldn&#39;t hold him tightly. He just wanted to touch him. I used to tell myself that I was jealous of Hassan, just a little bit.</p><p>---504---</p><p>If you were just a little bit more, you wouldn&#39;t be perfect.</p><p>---505---</p><p>(II) Continued</p><p>Xiao Kan wanted to climb down from the bench, but he took Salia&#39;s hand and walked out of the classroom.</p><p>When he saw that, Salia was like a mask, and he knew that you were a child, and you could not be at home.</p><p>---506---</p><p>You can also remind me of you like the wind.</p><p>I said this in a gentle, slightly panicked voice, knowing that I was a wounded person, knowing that my love for me was like the sky, vast and eternal.</p><p>---507---</p><p>Everyone wants to please others. Xiao Kan wanted to say, don&#39;t you want to?</p><p>---508---</p><p>Suddenly, at this moment, Hassan&#39;s voice rang in my mind: For you, thousands and thousands of times. Hassan, the Hassan with a cleft lip, the kite chaser.</p><p>---509---</p><p>I felt very uncomfortable with my departure. I am slim above the waist, but not as fat below the waist as I was when I was a kid. I look like I have put all my weight in my lower body. I look like a jigsaw puzzle, with different parts of my body put together. What&#39;s more, it looks like it has been made by finding the wrong parts to match, making everyone laugh.</p><p>---510---</p><p>Who can you see now?</p><p>---511---</p><p>I hope Simhan is here too.</p><p>---512---</p><p>I know, whenever that little girl sees Pari, I can see Baba too. She is my flesh and blood. I&#39;m going to see you soon, and my blood is running around us. I&#39;m not alone. A sudden happiness comes over me, and I feel it trickling into my body, and I feel gratitude and hope flowing into my twins.</p><p>---513---</p><p>Several times, I came close to winning the Winter Tour - once, I came close to winning the World Championship. You know that coming close and winning the World Championship is the way to go, isn&#39;t it? Dad is not that close, it&#39;s not just winning, the winner wins the World Championship, and the rest can only go home.</p><p>---514---</p><p>I read in poetry that there is a starless night, lovers can&#39;t sleep all night, endure the darkness, waiting for the sun to rise, and never come back to their lover. I met that star and it made me fall in love. For me, that night is like a wind.</p><p>---515---</p><p>People who grew up drinking the same milk are brothers, and this kind of love can&#39;t be separated even by time.</p><p>---516---</p><p>We are not compensating for all the truths that have gone away.</p><p>---517---</p><p>I know all the thoughts that are lingering in my mind, but how can I be like a book that needs to be opened in a few years in front of you?</p><p>---518---</p><p>I have a job since I left. In Afghanistan, I have a job; in America, I have a job. I have to thank Dubin for being my wife, but I don&#39;t like to accept charity.</p><p>---519---</p><p>Maybe I am a little painful, but I am still alive. So this is what I want to see, and I will continue to see it, forget it, and it will be written off in a few years, and it will come back. I hope I can breathe again.</p><p>---520---</p><p>All I smell is the smell of victory.</p><p>---521---</p><p>It was Fasuo who began to teach little Mariam to read, but she was very patient and focused, moving her lips over the words and moving her index finger under them, using all her strength to read.The nails were whitened by the pressure, as if they could squeeze out the meaning of the words. It was Fasu who began to hold Xiao&#39;s hand and taught Xiao to write the first stroke of the word, the second stroke, and the third stroke.</p><p>---522---</p><p>Dad and I were born under the same roof, but we were born in our own areas. The kite was the thin intersection between us.</p><p>---523---</p><p>&quot;A loyal Haza is a man who is as loyal as a dog.&quot;</p><p>---524---</p><p>For the innocence of a woman he had never met, my father was willing to shoot a bullet; now, if it weren&#39;t for the woman&#39;s plea, I would have strangled a man to death without hesitation.</p><p>---525---</p><p>Looking back, I realized that in the past two or four or six years, I have always been peeping at the deserted path.</p><p>---526---</p><p>If the wind also invites all the people under the sky, it is not a feast.</p><p>---527---</p><p>We may be stubborn, I know we are too proud, but in times of crisis, believe me, you and I would rather run away than be alone.</p><p>---528---</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be alone, I want to spend my life alone.</p><p>---529---</p><p>I want to know if I am listening to the sound of my nose breathing out, waiting for a subtle change in my breathing, showing my panic, so that I can see through my thoughts.</p><p>---530---</p><p>My face hurts because it is so stiff.</p><p>---531---</p><p>Woke up. Resuscitated.</p><p>---532---</p><p>In this country of nostalgia, I forgot what I had done. It didn&#39;t feel good.</p><p>---533---</p><p>Lucky Hazara is the only one who cares so much about others, and when others come, they should kneel down in front of you and brush the dust off your boots with their eyelashes.</p><p>---534---</p><p>&quot;Ethnic cleansing. I like it. I like the sound of it&quot;</p><p>---535---</p><p>I envy Xiaoxiang. Xiaoxiang&#39;s secret is exposed, spoken out, and solved.</p><p>---536---</p><p>No matter how it develops, it makes it clear: one of us must leave.</p><p>---537---</p><p>The only thing that Dad loves as deeply as his wife and son is Afghanistan, his homeland.</p><p>---538---</p><p>It should have been like this, and my father and I finally became friends. I finally got what I had dreamed of for many years. But now that I have it, I feel like a child and feel very empty.</p><p>---539---</p><p>There is a smell of shit, and his fingers are like a tooth.</p><p>---540---</p><p>Dad is Dad, I think, and I feel something.</p><p>---541---</p><p>Apologize for me! That hurts me.</p><p>---542---</p><p>This is a fight. Fighting is more shameful than what you call shame.</p><p>---543---</p><p>Maybe this is the best ending, which can reduce the pain of others and ease my suffering.</p><p>---544---</p><p>In a sense, these days are not mine, but mine.</p><p>---545---</p><p>I hope there is no end to what I fear most: no sincere devotion. All these thoughts, this is what I don&#39;t want to see most.</p><p>---546---</p><p>Childhood choices affect adulthood.</p><p>---547---</p><p>This is also a custom, and the family&#39;s death is sweeter.</p><p>---548---</p><p>I don&#39;t want to underestimate these things, I started to say, these are all like blood money.</p><p>---549---</p><p>People are in this difficult time now. It seems that they need to be underestimated, so they can also distract their attention.</p><p>---550---</p><p>I thank her for the nightfall, covering Hassan&#39;s face and covering my face.</p><p>---551---</p><p>I know you and I have a lot of problems. No matter what you think, it&#39;s you who is here, not me. I can&#39;t do anything about it.</p><p>---552---</p><p>You can&#39;t change the result after it&#39;s gone, you can only delay its arrival.</p><p>---553---</p><p>I&#39;m thinking about how big the void will be when my father passes away. I force myself to think about it. Even if the wind passes away, there will be wind. Now I think about some beautiful things in the future.</p><p>---554---</p><p>Dad is thinking about the country&#39;s road when he is young, and I will do my best to fulfill my duty as a human being.</p><p>---555---</p><p>I emptied the box, grabbed a handful of plaster from the middle of the dirt, kissed the dirt, put it in the box, put the box in the pocket on my chest, and pressed it against my heart.</p><p>---556---</p><p>Although I was in this country for a few years, I knew that you were underestimating me.</p><p>---557---</p><p>More than once, my father could hurt me with just a few words, which surprised no one.</p><p>---558---</p><p>My hands are my own hands, clean and soft; my hands are those of a laborer, dirty and covered with calluses.</p><p>---559---</p><p>Shining! The watch my father gave me. My child stared at the green pointer. I was so scared that I used my little imagination to get rid of them, I dared not blink.</p><p>---560---</p><p>I finally knew that you were right and I was determined to leave.</p><p>---561---</p><p>The rest of the process was only a fragmentary, intermittent memory in my mind, which was related to the sound and taste of my childhood.</p><p>---562---</p><p>Some people also realized that the past life had ended in this way.</p><p>---563---</p><p>The submissive look of the child, and the color I had seen ten years ago, the color of the lamb.</p><p>---564---</p><p>I saw the sheep&#39;s eyes, several stars, and I still saw the child&#39;s eyes in my dreams. My nightmare continued, and I went to see it when I was older. I went to see it because I wanted to see the animal. The absurd thing was that I imagined it could understand me. I imagined it knew that my impending doom was for the sake of a certain person who had taken his own life...</p><p>---565---</p><p>If I had betrayed someone, I would have thought that I was the one who had developed it.</p><p>---566---</p><p>I still had the final say, a final say that I could become a character like that.</p><p>---567---</p><p>You know, this could be a story for a person like me.</p><p>---568---</p><p>The image of that person who was beyond your reach attracted me deeply.</p><p>---569---</p><p>At that moment I fell in love with him, more than I loved him back then.</p><p>---570---</p><p>For a while, the country was full of vitality, and all kinds of things were discussed. People talked about things like women&#39;s rights and modern technology.</p><p>---571---</p><p>When the doctor told you that I was in a little pain, your troubles were getting bigger.</p><p>---572---</p><p>Scars remind us of the season we loved most</p><p>---573---</p><p>We are fooling ourselves, living in a place where a toy made of tissue paper, plastic and bamboo can bridge the gap between people who have left and us.</p><p>---574---</p><p>Nothing is free in this world.</p><p>---575---</p><p>Things are like demons, cancer has many different names.</p><p>---576---</p><p>Your eyes have also seen others, and you can&#39;t hold on for long.</p><p>---577---</p><p>In Kabul, you can&#39;t trust people. People inform on each other for rewards or threats against your behavior.</p><p>---578---</p><p>That was the key I needed to open Dad&#39;s heart.</p><p>---579---</p><p>America is a tough guy, a man he looked up to and looked down upon.</p><p>---580---</p><p>Homer and I started a war against each other, and in the end, it was this man who won.</p><p>---581---</p><p>Dad was like a widower, but he couldn&#39;t help thinking of his deceased wife.</p><p>---582---</p><p>You can&#39;t tell how much I was in my heart, how I could see the signal of loyalty, the damned, unwavering loyalty.</p><p>---583---</p><p>After creating, planning, struggling, worrying, dreaming, and doing everything in my life, I started to say: a child with a heart that doesn&#39;t fight for more than a suitcase.</p><p>---584---</p><p>I think my father loves America. It was in America that he was born and raised, and he got an ulcer.</p><p>---585---</p><p>It&#39;s not one&#39;s nature to be a child, it&#39;s one&#39;s nature that is being looked down upon.</p><p>---586---</p><p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m a child, ... ---587---</p><p>The past of those people who are not from the same ancestors as me is intertwined with each other.</p><p>---588---</p><p>I ran away, and I was a coward to you.</p><p>---589---</p><p>What embarrassed me was that Hassan tried his best to restore our relationship.</p><p>---590---</p><p>He knew that I had betrayed him, and saved me ten times in this way, maybe the last time I used him.</p><p>---591---</p><p>Our life after birth, even if it has not ended in this way, is still lingering.</p><p>---592---</p><p>Quan Rushifeng was a blue-collar worker who came from a certain place this year. He was overwhelmed by the economic policies of the country. His father was the only Republican in our building.</p><p>---593---</p><p>I felt as if a knife had stabbed my eyes.</p><p>---594---</p><p>It has been a year and a half now, and my father is still in the process of giving birth.</p><p>---595---</p><p>&quot;Please teach us how to be young, Master.&quot; Hassan said quietly. Without calling Ase &quot;Master&quot;, a thought flashed through my mind: What does it feel like to be a child of such a deep-rooted consciousness, born in a class-based group?</p><p>---596---</p><p>Across the bed, a change occurred in the framed photos of the young man. I looked at a few of them in a row, and then I remembered. I got these photos, and I took them. What did I do back then? Oh, that&#39;s right, when I was young. When I was developing the photos, I was still a little girl, so I sent her a set of photos for Salia. I thought the wind had left me with the girl. So many years. Salia. A sweet feeling surged through me, like honey. I thought she was my sister, and I felt like &quot;my daughter like Chengna&quot;, and it was like the wind.</p><p>---597---</p><p>May I be with you forever.</p><p>Hassan</p><p>---598---</p><p>I never forgot to leave my daughter like Wana. She was flat-chested, pale-faced, and dodged around since she left. Xiaokanxiang has curly hair, a rough face, and is depressed. She can&#39;t make her waist look like a man&#39;s shoulders. A pitiful shadow, suffering from double torture from others, one is jealousy, the other is excitement. Xiaokanxiang is watching others and sharing his own glory when he is with Cheng Suma for this month. He is like a low-lying grass, sucking the water from others that irrigated the lilies.</p><p>---599---</p><p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; he said, his voice hoarse, &quot;I hear the clock in the hallway ticking.
