Architecture is a very material thing. It takes a lot of resources, so why not eliminate what you don&#39;t need as long as you&#39;re able to achieve the same result?</p><p>The American attitude towards efficiency and execution should always underlie architecture.</p><p>The architecture profession has lost a lot of its integrity, especially in the USA. The general architect here has no scruples, no ambitions.</p><p>I&#39;d like to do a lot of things - whether in design or architecture or business.</p><p>So what we have tried to do in our later buildings is to try to be completely consistent, as a painter is consistent or as a sculptor is consistent. Architecture also must be very consistent.</p><p>Japanese architecture is very much copied in this country and in Europe.</p><p>If you examine this, I think that you will find that it&#39;s the mechanics of Japanese architecture that have been thought of as the direct influence upon our architecture.</p><p>If a building becomes architecture, then it is art.</p><p>Victorian architecture in the United States was copied straight from England.</p><p>The logic of Palladian architecture presented an aesthetic formula which could be applied universally.</p><p>The English light is so very subtle, so very soft and misty, that the architecture responded with great delicacy of detail.</p><p>The Egyptian contribution to architecture was more concerned with remembering the dead than the living.</p><p>Of all the lessons most relevant to architecture today, Japanese flexibility is the greatest.</p><p>Georgian architecture respected the scale of both the individual and the community.</p><p>French architecture always manages to combine the most magnificent underlying themes of architecture like Roman design, it looks to the community.</p><p>Japanese traditional architecture is created based on these conditions. This is the reason you have a very high degree of connection between the outside and inside in architecture.</p><p>The speed of change makes you wonder what will become of architecture.</p><p>Without this spirit, Modernist architecture cannot fully exist. Since there is often a mismatch between the logic and the spirit of Modernism, I use architecture to reconcile the two.</p><p>Italy is full of historical buildings. And Europe holds a great history of philosophy from Greece until today. I read all those books and see these buildings, and I think of where I stand when I design my architecture.</p><p>All those involved in the construction of an architectural design, from the architect to the builder, have an attachment to the architecture, although it&#39;s difficult to quantify the attachment.</p><p>Japanese architecture is traditionally based on wooden structures that need renovating on a regular basis.</p><p>Spiritual space is lost in gaining convenience. I saw the need to create a mixture of Japanese spiritual culture and modern western architecture.</p><p>People can inhabit anything. And they can be miserable in anything and ecstatic in anything. More and more I think that architecture has nothing to do with it. Of course, that&#39;s both liberating and alarming.</p><p>Until the Eighties, Oslo was a rather boring town, but it&#39;s changed a lot, and is now much more cosmopolitan. If I go downtown, I visit the harbour to see the tall ships and the ferries, and to admire the modern architecture such as the Opera House or the new Astrup Fearnley Museum on the water&#39;s edge.</p><p>Every time a student walks past a really urgent, expressive piece of architecture that belongs to his college, it can help reassure him that he does have that mind, does have that soul.</p><p>I believe very strongly, and have fought since many years ago - at least over 30 years ago - to get architecture not just within schools, but architecture talked about under history, geography, science, technology, art.</p><p>My house is my refuge, an emotional piece of architecture, not a cold piece of convenience.</p><p>We all love musical architecture there&#39;s no doubt about that.</p><p>Architecture in general is frozen music.</p><p>Painting, sculpture and architecture are finished, but the art habit continues.</p><p>Bridges are perhaps the most invisible form of public architecture.</p><p>Look, architecture has a lot of places to hide behind, a lot of excuses. &#39;The client made me do this.&#39; &#39;The city made me do this.&#39; &#39;Oh, the budget.&#39; I don&#39;t believe that anymore.</p><p>In fact, it will be very easy to climb the building because of its shape and architecture.</p><p>Charles was very intent to use his years as Prince of Wales to make his mark while he still had freedom of maneuver that he wouldn&#39;t have as King. The first subject he really went for was architecture. It made an impact.</p><p>It was the drawing that led me to architecture, the search for light and astonishing forms.</p><p>I search for surprise in my architecture. A work of art should cause the emotion of newness.</p><p>Trying to describe something musical is like dancing to architecture, it&#39;s really difficult.</p><p>Of the individual poems, some are more lyric and some are more descriptive or narrative. Each poem is fixed in a moment. All those moments written or read together take on the movement and architecture of a narrative.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve always been so captivated by architecture.</p><p>The two elements the traveler first captures in the big city are extra human architecture and furious rhythm. Geometry and anguish.</p><p>But I absolutely believe that architecture is a social activity that has to do with some sort of communication or places of interaction, and that to change the environment is to change behaviour.</p><p>Architecture is inhabited sculpture.</p><p>And when an architect has designed a house with large windows, which is a necessity today in order to pull the daylight into these very deep houses, then curtains come to play a big role in architecture.</p><p>I don&#39;t see that any buildings should be excluded from the term architecture, as long as they are done properly.</p><p>If architecture had nothing to do with art, it would be astonishingly easy to build houses, but the architect&#39;s task - his most difficult task - is always that of selecting.</p><p>In addressing a task, one almost always has several possible options, sometimes only a few, and they may all be practical and functional. But they lack the aesthetic aspect that raises it to architecture.</p><p>If architecture is, as is sometimes said, music set in concrete, then football and basketball may be said to be creativity embodied in team sports.</p><p>The architecture of a story can be a little bit different if it&#39;s a true story.</p><p>Chicago is known for good steaks, expensive stores and beautiful architecture. Unfortunately, the Windy City also enjoys a reputation for corrupt politics, violent crime, and some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere in the country.</p><p>We think of enterprise architecture as the process we use for fully describing and mapping business functionality and business requirements and relating them to information systems requirements.</p><p>Escape from the architecture ghetto is one of the major drivers and has been from the very beginning.</p><p>The intellectual force of the West is still dominant, but other cultures are getting stronger. I expect that we will develop a new way of thinking in architecture and urban planning, and that less will be based on our models.</p><p>People kind of tend to mystify design and architecture by suggesting you need to train.</p><p>I mean, certainly writing, painting, photography, dance, architecture, there is an aspect of almost every art form that is useful and that merges into film in some way.</p><p>I could be happy doing something like architecture. It would involve another couple of years of graduate school, but that&#39;s what I studied in college. That&#39;s what I always wanted to do.</p><p>My interest in architecture has always been sculptural. Most of my photography is of architecture.</p><p>Architecture is a science arising out of many other sciences, and adorned with much and varied learning by the help of which a judgment is formed of those works which are the result of other arts.</p><p>Of course I know very little about architecture, and the older I get the less I know.</p><p>Architecture is about public space held by buildings.</p><p>Architecture is a slow business, and city planning even slower.</p><p>I don&#39;t find Hollywood interesting, so I&#39;m thinking of studying architecture instead.</p><p>Architecture is a art when one consciously or unconsciously creates aesthetic emotion in the atmosphere and when this environment produces well being.</p><p>Every one who has a heart, however ignorant of architecture he may be, feels the transcendent beauty and poetry of the mediaeval churches.</p><p>Yet for my part, deeply as I am moved by the religious architecture of the Middle Ages, I cannot honestly say that I ever felt the slightest emotion in any modern Gothic church.</p><p>Winning a competition in architecture is a ticket to oblivion. It&#39;s just an idea. Ninety-nine per cent never get built.</p><p>I studied architecture in New York. So, really I was very moved, like everyone else, to try to contribute something that has that resonance and profundity of it means to all of us.</p><p>Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.</p><p>When I&#39;m in London, Claridge&#39;s is a great favourite. I&#39;m a big fan of art deco architecture and the rooms are extraordinary.</p><p>I take a lot from everywhere. I take from music, architecture, novels, and plays. Anywhere that hits you.</p><p>I&#39;ve never owned an Apple product. I like the fact that PCs are open architecture and not locked down like Apple products. I feel that Macs are also unjustifiably overpriced.</p><p>I&#39;ve always liked traveling around Europe and seeing the architecture. The buildings in capital cities have been there for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. Some look better than the new ones.</p><p>At this present time, matter is still the best way to think of architecture, but I&#39;m not so sure for very long. The computer is radicalizing the way we think about our world.</p><p>If you&#39;re into architecture and you&#39;re from the West, everything is hors d&#39;oeuvres for working to rebuild the Temple. Ultimately you&#39;re led there. You can&#39;t escape it.</p><p>You can just drift unhappily towards this vision of heaven on earth, and ultimately that is what architecture is a vision of: Heaven on earth, at it&#39;s best.</p><p>The intellectual architecture means focusing on doing great work instead of focusing on agency politics.</p><p>The team architecture means setting up an organization that helps people produce that great work in teams.</p><p>One of my favorite vacation places is Miami, because of the people, the water and the beach - of course - and the architecture on Miami Beach is so wonderful.</p><p>I would fix other people&#39;s lines if they asked me on occasion. The hard part of writing is the architecture of it, getting the story and structuring it. Not the tweaking of lines.</p><p>But those musics do not address the larger kind of architecture in time that classical music does, whatever each one of us knows that classical music must mean.</p><p>I quit college. I was studying architecture for about a year.</p><p>It is not with architecture that one can disseminate any political ideology.</p><p>Architecture will always express the technical and social progress of the country in which it is carried out. If we wish to give it the human content that it lacks, we must participate in the political struggle.</p><p>Architecture is my work, and I&#39;ve spent my whole life at a drawing board, but life is more important than architecture. What matters is to improve human beings.</p><p>Architecture is invention.</p><p>When I write now I do not invent situation, characters, or actions, but rather structures and discursive forms, textual groupings which are combined according to secret affinities among themselves, as in architecture or the plastic arts.</p><p>The organizational architecture is really that a centipede walks on hundred legs and one or two don&#39;t count. So if I lose one or two legs, the process will go on, the organization will go on, the growth will go on.</p><p>Does it follow that the house has nothing in common with art and is architecture not to be included in the arts? Only a very small part of architecture belongs to art: the tomb and the monument. Everything else that fulfils a function is to be excluded from the domain of art.</p><p>Architecture is involved with the world, but at the same time it has a certain autonomy. This autonomy cannot be explained in terms of traditional logic because the most interesting parts of the work are non-verbal. They operate within the terms of the work, like any art.</p><p>I&#39;m often called an old-fashioned modernist. But the modernists had the absurd idea that architecture could heal the world. That&#39;s impossible. And today nobody expects architects to have these grand visions any more.</p><p>The aesthetic of architecture has to be rooted in a broader idea about human activities like walking, relaxing and communicating. Architecture thinks about how these activities can be given added value.</p><p>You might say that when you step inside, you&#39;re entering a honorific space, but that&#39;s something totally different than experiencing it. And in architecture the experience comes first. That has the deepest effect on us.</p><p>In my experience, if you have to keep the lavatory door shut by extending your left leg, it&#39;s modern architecture.</p><p>I love a lot of things, and I&#39;m pretty much obsessive about most things I do, whether it be gardening, or architecture, or music. I&#39;d be an obsessive hairdresser.</p><p>Doctrines provide an architecture for both Republican and Democrat presidents to carry out policies.</p><p>That Moorish architecture is all over the place, of course. It affects me everywhere I see it, as it does so many people. But Brand Library was a special place to me, and I know I&#39;ve paid homage to it many times in my drawings.</p><p>Information and inspiration are everywhere... history, art, architecture, everything an illustrator needs. Europe is, after all, the land that has generated most of the enduring myths and legends of Western culture.</p><p>Once I got out of architecture school I decided not to be an architect, I just started my own little design studio.</p><p>I went to school for engineering, I studied jazz. So I always had this kind of creative side and technical side, and I thought architecture might be the way to combine them, so I went to architecture school in New York.</p><p>An important work of architecture will create polemics.</p><p>The same sort of thing happened in my dispute with the National Trust book: Follies: A National Trust Guide, which implied that the only pleasure you can get from Folly architecture is by calling the architect mad, and by laughing at the architecture.</p><p>I was a student at Columbia College, actually, in the Architecture school. Paul would drive in from Queens, showing me these new songs. I can&#39;t remember us working it out.</p><p>After about the first Millennium, Italy was the cradle of Romanesque architecture, which spread throughout Europe, much of it extending the structural daring with minimal visual elaboration.</p><p>After World War II great strides were made in modern Japanese architecture, not only in advanced technology, allowing earthquake resistant tall buildings, but expressing and infusing characteristics of traditional Japanese architecture in modern buildings.</p><p>The job of buildings is to improve human relations: architecture must ease them, not make them worse.</p><p>But I feel truly wowed by the architecture and the meaning of the architecture if you get lost in it and think about the man hours in the smallest little chapel, and the love involved. God it&#39;s fantastic.</p><p>There was an age, however, when the transition from savagery to civilization, with all its impressive outward manifestations in art and architecture, took place for the first time.</p><p>I think that narrative, fiction filmmaking is the culmination of several art forms: theater, art history, architecture. Whereas doc filmmaking is more pure cinema, like cinema verite is film in its purest form.</p><p>I was going to be an architect. I graduated with a degree in architecture and I had a scholarship to go back to Princeton and get my Masters in architecture. I&#39;d done theatricals in college, but I&#39;d done them because it was fun.</p><p>But after the time there I&#39;d had it with fashion again, so I left to go to architecture school in a summer course at Harvard, which didn&#39;t last very long.</p><p>Architecture can&#39;t fully represent the chaos and turmoil that are part of the human personality, but you need to put some of that turmoil into the architecture, or it isn&#39;t real.</p><p>I would like to attend college in the future when I have time. I have always been interested in architecture, so perhaps I would pursue a degree in that or business.</p><p>You look at the steamboat, the railroad, the car, the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo-American world, but they were popularized and extended by it. They were made possible by the financial architecture, the capital intensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo-Americans.</p><p>What&#39;s fascinating about D.C., the exteriors are these elaborate structures, this gorgeous architecture and beautiful stonework, and then you go inside and it&#39;s crap-looking - apart from the White House, which is beautiful.</p><p>I acquired an admiration for Japanese culture, art, and architecture, and learned of the existence of the game of GO, which I still play.</p><p>I would&#39;ve been intrigued by being a film director. I would&#39;ve been intrigued by politics. I thought about architecture.</p><p>There is a lot of interest in the arts, music, theatre, filmmaking, engineering, architecture and software design. I think we have now transitioned the modern-day version of the entrepreneur into the creative economy.</p><p>I like things that are kind of eclectic, when one thing doesn&#39;t go with another. That&#39;s why I love Rome. The town itself is that way. It&#39;s where Fascist architecture meets classic Renaissance, where the ancient bangs up against the contemporary. It has a touch of everything. That&#39;s my style, and that&#39;s what my work is about.</p><p>I feel however, that we architects have a special duty and mission...

I love that dealers are willing to take massive chances in order to give this much room to their artists. Most of all, I love that more galleries showing more art gives more artists a shot.</p><p>First let me report that the art in the Barnes Collection has never looked better. My trips to the old Barnes were always amazing, but except on the sunniest days, you could barely see the art. The building always felt pushed beyond its capacity.</p><p>Not to say people shouldn&#39;t get rich from art. I adore the alchemy wherein artists who cast a complex spell make rich people give them their money. (Just writing it makes me cackle.) But too many artists have been making money without magic.</p><p>These days, newish art can be priced between $10,000 and $25,000. When I tell artists that a new painting by a newish artist should go for around $1,200, they look at me like I&#39;m a flesh-eating virus.</p><p>In art, scandal is a false narrative, a smoke screen that camouflages rather than reveals. When we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re seeing, we overreact.</p><p>Damien Hirst is the Elvis of the English art world, its ayatollah, deliverer, and big-thinking entrepreneurial potty-mouthed prophet and front man. Hirst synthesizes punk, Pop Art, Jeff Koons, Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, and Catholicism.</p><p>Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries. There&#39;s likely more combined square footage for the showing of art on one New York block - West 24th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues - than in all of Amsterdam&#39;s or Hamburg&#39;s galleries.</p><p>Yes, 85 percent of the art you see isn&#39;t any good. But everyone has a different opinion about which 85 percent is bad. That in turn creates fantastically unstable interplay and argument.</p><p>Many museums are drawing audiences with art that is ostensibly more entertaining than stuff that just sits and invites contemplation. Interactivity, gizmos, eating, hanging out, things that make noise - all are now the norm, often edging out much else.</p><p>Imagine it&#39;s 1981. You&#39;re an artist, in love with art, smitten with art history. You&#39;re also a woman, with almost no mentors to look to art history just isn&#39;t that into you. Any woman approaching art history in the early eighties was attempting to enter an almost foreign country, a restricted and exclusionary domain that spoke a private language.</p><p>Willem de Kooning is generally credited for coming out of the painterly gates strong in the forties, revolutionizing art and abstraction and reaching incredible heights by the early fifties, and then tailing off.</p><p>I also take pleasure in the so-called negative power in Grotjahn&#39;s work. That is, I love his paintings for what they are not. Unlike much art of the past decade, Grotjahn isn&#39;t simply working from a prescribed checklist of academically acceptable, curator-approved &#39;isms&#39; and twists.</p><p>It is not possible to overstate the influence of Paul Cezanne on twentieth-century art. He&#39;s the modern Giotto, someone who shattered one kind of picture-making and invented a new one that the world followed.</p><p>The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city&#39;s magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.</p><p>Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you&#39;ll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).</p><p>My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.</p><p>I&#39;m noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum&#39;s &#39;Younger Than Jesus&#39; last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I&#39;m seeing it blossom and bear fruit at &#39;Greater New York,&#39; MoMA P.S. 1&#39;s twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.</p><p>Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art.</p><p>It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn&#39;t own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>All of Koons&#39;s best art - the encased vacuum cleaners, the stainless-steel Rabbit (the late-twentieth century&#39;s signature work of Simulationist sculpture), the amazing gleaming Balloon Dog, and the cast-iron re-creation of a Civil War mortar exhibited last month at the Armory - has simultaneously flaunted extreme realism, idealism, and fantasy.</p><p>Venice is the perfect place for a phase of art to die. No other city on earth embraces entropy quite like this magical floating mall.</p><p>Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you&#39;ll find it. It&#39;s there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already-existing film.</p><p>After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it&#39;s now close to aesthetic kudzu.</p><p>The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we&#39;re not pure enough, good omens appear.</p><p>Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don&#39;t seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist&#39;s work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there&#39;s something wrong with the art.</p><p>Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.</p><p>It&#39;s great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.</p><p>The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer&#39;s journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It&#39;s not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive.</p><p>It&#39;s art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn&#39;t about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - &#39;contain multitudes.&#39;</p><p>The last time money left the art world, intrepid types maxed out their credit cards and opened galleries, and a few of them have become the best in the world.</p><p>Much good art got made while money ruled I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren&#39;t virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won&#39;t have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They&#39;ll be able to experiment as much as they want.</p><p>While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices, an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It&#39;s not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves. It&#39;s a change of mood or expectation, a desire for art to be more than showy effects, big numbers, and gamesmanship.</p><p>When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won&#39;t miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the &#39;Eventocracy.&#39; All this flashy &#39;art-fair art&#39; and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.</p><p>A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit, she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors&#39; homes, in galleries, on the walls of auction houses, and off the walls, in museum storage.</p><p>Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books.</p><p>If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which, for two months every other year, new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by.</p><p>A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years, during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers.</p><p>It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino&#39;s work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.</p><p>Untitled&#39; is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it&#39;s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art&#39;s wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;&#39;Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,&#39; the Whitney Museum&#39;s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it&#39;ll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don&#39;t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn&#39;t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They&#39;re all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade&#39;s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I&#39;d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade&#39;s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager&#39;s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you&#39;re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art&#39;s version of Einstein&#39;s Theory of Relativity. It&#39;s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I&#39;ve ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn&#39;t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn&#39;t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that&#39;s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, &#39;The Clock&#39; is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don&#39;t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I&#39;ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they&#39;re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I&#39;m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he&#39;s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he&#39;s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you&#39;re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a &#39;conflict of interest.&#39; But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren&#39;t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We&#39;re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We&#39;re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don&#39;t listen to what art critics say.

I think it&#39;s beautiful and a real work of art.</p><p>More than art, more than literature, music is universally accessible.</p><p>I think no artist can claim to have any access to the truth, or an authentic version of an event. But obviously they have slightly better means at their disposal because they have their art to energize whatever it is they&#39;re trying to write about. They have music.</p><p>Every man should follow the bent of his nature in art and letters, always provided that he does not offend against the rules of morality and good taste.</p><p>He has only half learned the art of reading who has not added to it the more refined art of skipping and skimming.</p><p>If only life could be a little more tender and art a little more robust.</p><p>Seek art from every time and place, in any form, to connect with those who really move you.</p><p>Back then, I didn&#39;t have a big organization around me.

It is not like stocking a grocery store where people fill a pushcart. Art is a product that has no apparent need.

The emotion must come by nature, but the measure can be acquired by art.</p><p>I&#39;d like to introduce someone who has just come into my life. I&#39;ve admired him for 35 years. He&#39;s someone who represents integrity, honesty, art, and on top of that stuff I&#39;m actually sleeping with him.</p><p>An art whose medium is language will always show a high degree of critical creativeness, for speech is itself a critique of life: it names, it characterizes, it passes judgment, in that it creates.</p><p>Art is nothing but the expression of our dream the more we surrender to it the closer we get to the inner truth of things, our dream-life, the true life that scorns questions and does not see them.</p><p>The art of communication is the language of leadership.</p><p>I love to collect modern art.</p><p>For nine years I worked to change what was hairdressing then into a geometric art form with color, perm without setting which had never been done before.</p><p>I choose films for their artistic value. I don&#39;t need a mansion or a Jaguar. When I leave this Earth, I won&#39;t take any money with me. All I will leave behind will be my art.</p><p>Alchemy is the art of far and near, and I think poetry is alchemy in that way. It&#39;s delightful to distort size, to see something that&#39;s tiny as though it were vast.</p><p>Only in men&#39;s imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art as of life.</p><p>The idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new.</p><p>Any work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art should carry its justification in every line.</p><p>When thou art at Rome, do as they do at Rome.</p><p>Rock isn&#39;t art, it&#39;s the way ordinary people talk.</p><p>Tell me thy company, and I&#39;ll tell thee what thou art.</p><p>Book-jacket design may become a lost art, like album-cover design, without which late-20th-century iconography would have been pauperized.</p><p>Art is nature speeded up and God slowed down.</p><p>There was a big drive when I was at art school to make you aware of the economy of meaning - after all, this was still during the tail end of minimalism. Being responsible for everything you put in your picture, and being able to defend it. Keeping everything clear around you so you know what is operating. To open the wound and keep it clean.</p><p>I was very much into buying contemporary art, but I&#39;ve just decided I want to get rid of it all. Not that it&#39;s not great art, but all of a sudden my mood has changed, and I want to go back to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century masters.</p><p>I did this Super-8 film at art school called &#39;Tissues,&#39; this black comedy about a family whose father has been arrested for child molestation. I was absolutely thrilled by every inch of it, and would throw my projector in the back of my car and show it to anybody who would watch it.</p><p>The great art of films does not consist of descriptive movement of face and body but in the movements of thought and soul transmitted in a kind of intense isolation.</p><p>Magic becomes art when it has nothing to hide.</p><p>Science is spectral analysis. Art is light synthesis.</p><p>My first love is art, and I see a lot of things in an artistic way.</p><p>In my world, history comes down to language and art.

And God promises you your marked moments are on their way.</p><p>Success or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something. Soon it becomes a reality. Act, look, feel successful, conduct yourself accordingly, and you will be amazed at the positive results.</p><p>Like success, failure is many things to many people.

Nor does he represent anything what our forefathers stood for. This country is basically built on an attitude. It&#39;s a way of life. It&#39;s not because you&#39;re born here.

It killed Russia.</p><p>Stop this attitude that older people ain&#39;t any good anymore! We&#39;re as good as we ever were - if we ever were any good.</p><p>My attitude to peace is rather based on the Burmese definition of peace - it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world.

Constantly color your picture gray, and your picture will always be bleak.

Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.</p><p>Some people say I have attitude - maybe I do... but I think you have to.

Your attitude is optimistic rather than pessimistic.</p><p>What matters to me is that I do what I think is right and I see, I&#39;m a numbers guy, that&#39;s my attitude.

That&#39;s exactly what I should be doing.</p><p>I developed a nutty attitude where I&#39;d think, If some guy really loves me he doesn&#39;t care if I&#39;m fat.

Everybody has that. But a champion needs, in his attitude, a motivation above and beyond winning.</p><p>Americans are the most generous country on the planet. I&#39;ve worked in Europe, I&#39;ve worked in Australia. There is no where else where you get absolutely no attitude for being a foreigner.

I was not assimilating. So I went to work, taking any jobs I could get.</p><p>A lot of times I find that people who are blessed with the most talent don&#39;t ever develop that attitude, and the ones who aren&#39;t blessed in that way are the most competitive and have the biggest heart.</p><p>So long as you&#39;ve got your friends about you, and a good positive attitude, you don&#39;t really have to care what everyone else thinks.</p><p>I separated from the Southern Baptists when they adopted the discriminatory attitude towards women, because I believe what Paul taught in Galatians that there is no distinction in God&#39;s eyes between men and women, slaves and masters, Jews and non-Jews - everybody is created equally in the eyes of God.</p><p>My attitude toward men who mess around is simple: If you find &#39;em, kill &#39;em.</p><p>Prayer is talking with God.

Only North Americans seem to believe that they always should, may, and actually can choose somebody with whom to share their blessings. Ultimately this attitude leads to bombing people into the acceptance of gifts.</p><p>I keep guitars that are, you know, the neck&#39;s a little bit bent and it&#39;s a little bit out of tune.

I want it to be a struggle.</p><p>Most of my arguments with musicians through the years have had more to do with their attitude about music, or their attitude about their own lives, or their personal responsibility. Music has never really been the big centerpiece of the fight.</p><p>I love everybody. One of the great things about me is that I have a very positive attitude.</p><p>Mankind&#39;s true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals. And in this respect mankind has suffered a fundamental debacle, a debacle so fundamental that all others stem from it.</p><p>It&#39;s sort of a mental attitude about critical thinking and curiosity.

The problem isn&#39;t about gay people, the problem is about the attitude towards gay people. People think that all gays are Hannibal Lecters.

We need a civil rights movement within the African-American community.</p><p>It&#39;s a question of keeping one&#39;s eyes and ears open and watching how other people play the game.

But the information and the discussion sometimes come too late, after the effective decision has been made.</p><p>The Stones are a different kind of group. I realized that when I joined them.

A completely different attitude.</p><p>I&#39;m not a music lover in the sense that I look for something to have on. I&#39;ve never had that attitude to music.</p><p>I think one of the things that language poets are very involved with is getting away from conventional ideas of beauty, because those ideas contain a certain attitude toward women, certain attitudes toward sex, certain attitudes toward race, etc.</p><p>When you Google me, you&#39;ll find a lot of people don&#39;t like Richard Dreyfuss.

So far there&#39;s 100 percent support for that.</p><p>My mother, she had a very good attitude toward money. I&#39;m very grateful for the fact that we had to learn to save.

She&#39;s worked really hard her whole life and I just think she&#39;s got a great attitude. Moms just know so much it&#39;s so silly.</p><p>It&#39;s tricky. I&#39;ve never been standing at the top of the tree with tons of money thrown at me. I&#39;ve never really had a profile.

You know what I&#39;m saying.</p><p>The war changed everybody&#39;s attitude.

It relaxed my attitude to the job my center of focus shifted, which I think is very helpful, because even if you&#39;re not a very indulgent actor you spend a lot of time thinking about yourself. I don&#39;t think that is particularly healthy.</p><p>I always said punk was an attitude. It was never about having a Mohican haircut or wearing a ripped T-shirt.

The scene where Robert De Niro is looking at himself in the mirror saying, &#39;You talkin&#39; to me? You talkin&#39; to me?

I take each case, each job, as it comes.</p><p>What has happened is that to some degree they have taken an attitude where they don&#39;t listen to demos of diverse subject matters.

Instead of sitting and watching something, they want to be a part of it - they&#39;re very hedonistic and sensual.</p><p>We have become aware of the responsibility for our attitude towards the dark pages in our history. We have understood that bad service is done to the nation by those who are impelling to renounce that past.</p><p>But I do think that we approach music, in of itself, with a religious attitude.</p><p>I think that generally music should be a positive thing, I like Bob Marley&#39;s attitude: he said that his goal in life was to single handedly fight all the evil in the world with nothing but music, and when he went to a place he didn&#39;t go to play, he went to conquer.</p><p>In 1977, at least, he wished to have people believe that he shared and was proud of an attitude toward women that is not acceptable in a politician.

Which is what I intend to do.</p><p>So at a time in which the media give the public everything it wants and desires, maybe art should adopt a much more aggressive attitude towards the public.

He was a musician, but he knew all about the attitude part of it.</p><p>The world is full of musicians who can play great, and you wouldn&#39;t cross the road to see them.

We need to think through how we can produce a better quality product at less cost.</p><p>In terms of work I&#39;ve always had a Bad Attitude in that I won&#39;t work anywhere which requires me to work strict hours or follow a dress code.

It sparks an attitude some object or emotion causes a reaction in the other person.</p><p>There are a lot of female artists my age around at the moment, but they&#39;re all American and blonde and blue-eyed and smiley.

They were passions I kept secret because I didn&#39;t understand I could love clothes and hair and makeup and still like girls.</p><p>Thanks to capitalism, the importance placed on beauty has never been so manipulated.

And that&#39;s what&#39;s incredible about it because nobody has done that before, that&#39;s new territory.</p><p>With guys I revere, like Marcus Garvey or Malcolm X, their look is less about style than purpose and the expression of beauty. It wasn&#39;t just about being noticed, you know?</p><p>Who knows better than artists how much ugliness there is on the way to beauty, how many ghastly, mortifying missteps, how many days of granitic blockheadedness and dismaying ineptitude there is on the way to accomplishment, how partial all accomplishment is, how incomplete?</p><p>Every man who has shown the world the way to beauty, to true culture, has been a rebel, a &#39;universal&#39; without patriotism, without home, who has found his people everywhere.</p><p>I discovered that the horse is life itself, a metaphor but also an example of life&#39;s mystery and unpredictability, of life&#39;s generosity and beauty, a worthy object of repeated and ever changing contemplation.</p><p>Beauty comes from a life well lived.

I am a public servant doing my best against the odds. As I develop and serve, be patient. God is not finished with me yet.</p><p>Of all the home remedies, a good wife is best.</p><p>Everywhere I go, I&#39;m asked if I think the universities stifle writers. My opinion is that they don&#39;t stifle enough of them. There&#39;s many a best seller that could have been prevented by a good teacher.</p><p>These things bring you to reality as to how fragile you are at the same moment you are doing something that nobody else is able to do. The same moment that you are seen as the best, the fastest and somebody that cannot be touched, you are enormously fragile.</p><p>I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together again and tell myself that the mended whole was as good as new. What is broken is broken - and I&#39;d rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I lived.</p><p>Goals provide the energy source that powers our lives. One of the best ways we can get the most from the energy we have is to focus it. That is what goals can do for us concentrate our energy.</p><p>The deferring of anger is the best antidote to anger.</p><p>Man, being reasonable, must get drunk the best of life is but intoxication.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/quotes/edit/main/src/guide/why not eliminate.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/When%20newspapers.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>When newspapers 03b</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/William%20James.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>William James 3cd</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
