at ease on a track that I know not, And restless and lost on a road that I know.</p><p>When I do get the chance I just love to hang around at home with friends and family.</p><p>There is only one home to the life of a river-mussel there is only one home to the life of a tortoise there is only one shell to the soul of man: there is only one world to the spirit of our race. If that world leaves its course and smashes on boulders of the great void, whose world will give us shelter?</p><p>I daresay one good concert justifies a week of satisfaction at home.</p><p>A visit to a cinema is a little outing in itself. It breaks the monotony of an afternoon or evening it gives a change from the surroundings of home, however pleasant.</p><p>For example, I was a White House intern the summer before I dropped out of law school. Everybody knew about it. I&#39;d come home and go to church and everybody would say, &#39;Oh, my God. Demetri, you&#39;re working at the White House.&#39;</p><p>You leave home to seek your fortune and, when you get it, you go home and share it with your family.</p><p>Producing is so exciting because you can enable things to happen, whether it&#39;s like discovering a filmmaker who you&#39;re taking a chance on, protecting a battle and driving home at the end of the day just going, &#39;I&#39;m so glad I stayed late at work and fought hard for that. Had my passion. Won that battle.&#39;</p><p>It seems sensible to me that we should look to the medical profession, that over the centuries has helped us to live longer and healthier lives, to help us die peacefully among our loved ones in our own home without a long stay in God&#39;s waiting room.</p><p>But now, being a parent, I go home and see my son and I forget about any mistake I ever made or the reason I&#39;m upset. I get home and my son is smiling or he comes running to me. It has just made me grow as an individual and grow as a man.</p><p>For target shooting, that&#39;s okay. Get a license and go to the range. For defense of the home, that&#39;s why we have police departments.</p><p>Home is pretty utopian.</p><p>The greenest home is the one you don&#39;t build. If you really want to save the Earth, move in with another family and share a house that&#39;s already built. Better yet, live in the forest and eat whatever the squirrels don&#39;t want.</p><p>Obviously there&#39;s not much options when you&#39;re a cartoonist - you pretty much either work at home or rent an office I guess, and working at home just seems easier.</p><p>The appreciative smile, the chuckle, the soundless mirth, so important to the success of comedy, cannot be understood unless one sits among the audience and feels the warmth created by the quality of laughter that the audience takes home with it.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t care less about fashion. If I had taken any clothes home, they would have remained in my closet for the rest of their existence.</p><p>Playing drums feels like coming home for me. Even during the White Stripes I thought: &#39;I&#39;ll do this for now, but I&#39;m really a drummer.&#39; That&#39;s what I&#39;ll put on my passport application.</p><p>If there were no schools to take the children away from home part of the time, the insane asylums would be filled with mothers.</p><p>I love coming home to somebody, I love being in a relationship.</p><p>Home life ceases to be free and beautiful as soon as it is founded on borrowing and debt.</p><p>I think what is British about me is my feelings and awareness of others and their situations. English people are always known to be well mannered and cold but we are not cold - we don&#39;t interfere in your situation. If we are heartbroken, we don&#39;t scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own.</p><p>But if there&#39;s an erosion at home, you know, Thomas Jefferson warned about a tyranny of an oligarchy and if we surrender our democracy to the tyranny of an oligarchy, we&#39;ve made a terrible mistake.</p><p>When you live on the road, going home is a place to escape and just be with your family to unwind.</p><p>Well, look at what people are doing for returned veterans now. The wounded warriors. They&#39;re working hard to make the wounded veterans feel that they are loved and welcomed home, unlike Vietnam. It was not a very kind, gentle world then. I think we are kinder and gentler.</p><p>Going home and spending time with your family and your real friends keeps you grounded.</p><p>Kill all the rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home, kill your parents, that&#39;s where it&#39;s really at.</p><p>I don&#39;t really consider myself one of those actors who takes his work home with him.</p><p>Swimming is normal for me. I&#39;m relaxed. I&#39;m comfortable, and I know my surroundings. It&#39;s my home.</p><p>As a child, the family that I had and the love I had from my two parents allowed me to go ahead and be more aggressive, to search and to take risks knowing that, if I failed, I could always come home to a family of love and support.</p><p>Just take the ball and throw it where you want to. Throw strikes. Home plate don&#39;t move.</p><p>I feel most at home in the water. I disappear. That&#39;s where I belong.</p><p>Here is my first principle of foreign policy: good government at home.</p><p>However painful the process of leaving home, for parents and for children, the really frightening thing for both would be the prospect of the child never leaving home.</p><p>On stage, I make love to 25,000 different people, then I go home alone.</p><p>The first time that you escape from home or the small town that you live in - there&#39;s a reason a small town is called a small town: It&#39;s because not many people want to live there.</p><p>Now that virtually every career is an option for ambitious girls, it can no longer be considered regressive or reactionary to reintroduce discussion of marriage and motherhood to primary education. We certainly do not want to return to the simplistic duality of home economics classes for girls and wood shop for boys.</p><p>When you do take the home pregnancy test, it doesn&#39;t quite seem real. But when you see the baby and the heartbeat on the ultrasound, it&#39;s so incredible.</p><p>I was brought up in the modern world of all the luxury and the highlight of show business. I was born into a Christian home.</p><p>I will not have my son grow up in a tension-filled home.</p><p>I was brought up in a household of chaos and I never felt stable at home.</p><p>I would love to have a robot at home.</p><p>To have the opportunity to complete the slam at the Open at St Andrews, the home of golf, is something I will never ever forget.</p><p>I get 0.5 seconds to react to a ball, sometimes even less than that. I can&#39;t be thinking of what XYZ has said about me. I need to surrender myself to my natural instincts. My subconscious mind knows exactly what to do. It is trained to react. At home, my family doesn&#39;t discuss media coverage.</p><p>I&#39;m going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it, but I&#39;m going home right now.</p><p>Akron, Ohio, is my home. I will always be here. I&#39;m still working out at my old high school.</p><p>Children who cling to parents or who don&#39;t want to leave home are stunted in their emotional, psychological growth.</p><p>A home is crucial, the foundation of a stable family.</p><p>Having leveled my palace, don&#39;t erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home.</p><p>I try to devote my afternoons to making music in my home studio, but it&#39;s a lot more fun hanging out with musicians and friends, and trying subtly to influence a band than making your own stuff.</p><p>If I were running to be somebody, there are a lot of easier sombodies to be. After all, running against the incumbent governor of your own party in your home state is not the next logical step in a political life.</p><p>You know who a complicated tax code kills? The guy or gal trying to start a business out of the spare bedroom of their home. So we&#39;ve got to simplify our tax code.</p><p>Americans chose a free enterprise system designed to provide a quality of opportunity, not compel a quality of results. And that is why this is only place in the world where you can open up a business in the spare bedroom of your home.</p><p>More than anything else, I want the folks back at home to think right of me.</p><p>Just because I managed to do a little something, I don&#39;t want anyone back home to think I got the big head.</p><p>If you go away on location for three months and your wife stays at home, you&#39;ve made a whole new load of friends and she&#39;s made a whole new load of friends and you get home and you&#39;re kind of strangers.</p><p>My real fantasy if I was to drop out would be to live in a mobile home and be a hippie and drive around festivals and have millions of children - children with dreadlocks and nose rings - and play the flute.</p><p>I like to think of myself at home in the armchair, writing, smoking and occasionally wandering down the shop.</p><p>I live by &#39;Go big or go home.&#39; That&#39;s with everything. It&#39;s like either commit and go for it or don&#39;t do it at all. I apply that to everything. I apply that to relationships, I apply that to like sports, I apply that to everything. That&#39;s what I live by. That&#39;s how I like it.</p><p>All things on earth point home in old October sailors to sea, travellers to walls and fences, hunters to field and hollow and the long voice of the hounds, the lover to the love he has forsaken.</p><p>My mother was determined to make us independent. When I was four years old, she stopped the car a few miles from our house and made me find my own way home across the fields. I got hopelessly lost.</p><p>I have an abacus at home.</p><p>The desire to hit a big home run is dominating the music business.</p><p>I like my home and I like the nature.</p><p>I left home because I was hungry.</p><p>Let woman out of the home, let man into it, should be the aim of education. The home needs man, and the world outside needs woman.</p><p>Our poverty will be brought home to us to its full extent only after the war.</p><p>One of the great privileges of having grown up in a middle-class literary English household, but having gone to school in the front lines in Southeast London, was that I became half-street-urchin and half-good-boy at home. I knew that dichotomy was possible.</p><p>Sometimes in the past when I played something might make me lose focus, or I would go home after a game where I thought I could have played better and I would let it hang over my head for a long time when it shouldn&#39;t.</p><p>Akron, Ohio, is my home. It will always be remembered. Akron, Ohio, is my life.</p><p>I have no idea how to get in touch with anyone anymore. Everyone, it seems, has a home phone, a cell phone, a regular e-mail account, a Facebook account, a Twitter account, and a Web site. Some of them also have a Google Voice number. There are the sentimental few who still have fax machines.</p><p>I want to let my friend Buster know that I would like to have dinner with him tonight. Does Buster work at home? Then how likely is he to have his cell phone on? Is he one of those people who only turns on his cell when he&#39;s in his car? I hate that.</p><p>I remember, when I was a kid, watching my mother jam herself into her girdle - a piece of equipment so rigid it could stand up on its own - and I remember her coming home from fancy parties and racing upstairs to extricate herself from its cruel iron grip.</p><p>Major league baseball has asked its players to stop tossing baseballs into the stands during games, because they say fans fight over them and they get hurt. In fact, the Florida Marlins said that&#39;s why they never hit any home runs. It&#39;s a safety issue.</p><p>Yeah, anybody can go in with two turntables and a microphone or a home studio sampler and a little cassette deck or whatever and make records in their bedrooms.</p><p>If anything, a lot of electronic music is music that no one listens to at home, hardly. It&#39;s really only to be heard when everyone&#39;s out enjoying it.</p><p>A woman should be home with the children, building that home and making sure there&#39;s a secure family atmosphere.</p><p>Because of my parents&#39; love of democracy, we came to America after being driven twice from our home in Czechoslovakia - first by Hitler and then by Stalin.</p><p>I know that war is very cruel and that life is harder when you aren&#39;t able to live in the place you called home.</p><p>I&#39;m always going to live in Texas. Texas is my home - it&#39;ll be my home forever.</p><p>I love coming home to Melbourne. The first thing I do is have a coffee. It&#39;s just so much better here than anywhere else. It&#39;s better than in Italy and I travel a lot. I crave it.</p><p>Most people, if you live in a big city, you see some form of schizophrenia every day, and it&#39;s always in the form of someone homeless. &#39;Look at that guy - he&#39;s crazy. He looks dangerous.&#39; Well, he&#39;s on the streets because of mental illness. He probably had a job and a home.</p><p>I like being at home and cooking.</p><p>The triple is the most exciting play in baseball. Home runs win a lot of games, but I never understood why fans are so obsessed with them.</p><p>Well, I just said that Jesus and I were both Jewish and that neither of us ever had a job, we never had a home, we never married and we traveled around the countryside irritating people.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe in organized religion - I dealt with them hand in hand, and a whole bunch of Catholic priests tried to molest me. Telling me I was gay and I should go home with them and stuff.</p><p>Philosophy is properly home-sickness the wish to be everywhere at home.</p><p>Managing is getting paid for home runs that someone else hits.</p><p>They say Yogi Berra is funny. Well, he has a lovely wife and family, a beautiful home, money in the bank, and he plays golf with millionaires. What&#39;s funny about that?</p><p>Ability is the art of getting credit for all the home runs somebody else hits.</p><p>The curious are always in some danger. If you are curious you might never come home.</p><p>My biggest nightmare is I&#39;m driving home and get sick and go to hospital. I say: &#39;Please help me.&#39; And the people say: &#39;Hey, you look like...&#39; And I&#39;m dying while they&#39;re wondering whether I&#39;m Barbra Streisand.</p><p>Perhaps there is no greater issue facing contemporary women than the choices they must make about balancing home and work.</p><p>I didn&#39;t really seek attention. I just wanted to play the game well and go home.</p><p>One of the best things to come out of the home computer revolution could be the general and widespread understanding of how severely limited logic really is.</p><p>Child abuse and neglect offend the basic values of our state. We have a responsibility to provide safe settings for at-risk children and facilitate permanent placement for children who cannot return home.</p><p>You can&#39;t have it both ways. You can&#39;t tell me that you&#39;re taxed enough already, and that you want constitutional government and then in the next breath say, &#39;Bring me home some bacon.&#39; The pig has been picked clean.</p><p>Going home must be like going to render an account.</p><p>It began to dawn on me that perhaps my country needed me more at home than overseas.</p><p>There are times when I&#39;m driving home after a day&#39;s shooting, thinking to myself, That scene would&#39;ve been so much better if I had written it out.</p><p>Well, after the divorce, I went home and turned all the lights on!</p><p>When the good lord calls you home, the government ought not come get your home.</p><p>I stand before you as the governor of Texas but also stand before you the son of two tenant farmers.

So I usually ignore my home phone.</p><p>When my son was born, and after a day of lying-in I was told that I could leave the hospital and take him home, I burst into tears.

So you do it yourself, and it takes time and energy and effort. And if you give it the time, it&#39;s profoundly enjoyable.</p><p>We call our country home of the brave and land of the free, but it&#39;s not. We give a false portrayal of freedom.

You can look at all the aspects that make a purchase practical, but that kind of thinking makes it an investment rather than a home.</p><p>And, you know, you try and preach to them there&#39;s more to this game than just walking up to home plate, swinging the bat, fielding a ground ball.

Writers - we&#39;re much more comfortable at parties standing in the corner watching everybody else having a good time than we are mingling.</p><p>Your home is regarded as a model home, your life as a model life.

At noon, it&#39;s time to go home and turn up the pot roast and get the peas out of the freezer.</p><p>I actually do think you&#39;re seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging.

My wife has never learnt cooking but she has great cooks at home.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine dating a boy, meeting him only outside the home.

When I&#39;m working, it&#39;s 100%. When I&#39;m with my friends, I put everything away and enjoy life. When I come home to my kids, it&#39;s pure joy and everything&#39;s worth it.

I&#39;ve learned how to juggle my life and I feel like now I have the perfect balance.</p><p>When I started editing on my home computer, I said to myself, &#39;Well, I could be at home studying for a class or I could be at home editing a video.&#39;</p><p>If you don&#39;t have public hangings for bad culture in a company, if you don&#39;t take people out and let them say, they went home to spend more time with the family.

I miss the weather. I&#39;ve spent moss of the last 25 years on tour. I&#39;m ready to come home.</p><p>Family life was wonderful. The streets were bleak. The playgrounds were bleak.

President Obama&#39;s decision to withdraw 33,000 troops from Afghanistan before he stands for reelection is not driven by the United States&#39; &#39;position of strength&#39; in the war zone as much as it is by grim economic and political realities at home.</p><p>White House operatives went to great lengths to show Obama shifting focus from wars abroad to domestic issues at home.</p><p>I&#39;m most at home on the stage.

But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time. It&#39;s a unique thing to Hollywood that if you don&#39;t do that every time, then you&#39;re considered a failure. But it&#39;s like, &#39;Well, are you making movies to be successful? Or are you making movies to learn something?&#39;</p><p>I mean, I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time.

Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now.</p><p>Performers are so vulnerable.

The environment around you has so much to do with your character, and when I&#39;m home, my character really changes quite a bit.</p><p>I like to maintain a certain sense of fantasy in my life.

People usually go to work about 9 and come home around 5, or maybe 7.</p><p>I just get so fed up with seeing the same things written about me. If I see the words &#39;ice queen&#39; attached to me, I feel like banging my head against the wall.

I mean we all deny it like crazy but deep down there is always that voice saying you should be at home.</p><p>Illogical thinkers throw names and slurs around because they have no arguments with which to rebut their opponents. Rational people have to keep hammering their points home.</p><p>Remember the rights of the savage, as we call him.

I love to create this fantasy kind of thing.</p><p>All of a sudden to get all of this attention, and to be away from home and working all the time was hard. I was on planes all the time.

It&#39;s a short letter - all she said was, &#39;Hey, since it&#39;s harder for you to go out these days without getting photographed, here $10 for a pizza.&#39; I was like, &#39;Aww, she sent me money for a pizza so I could eat at home!&#39;</p><p>At home in L.A., Sunday is lazy. It&#39;s the wife and me lying in bed with coffee, watching &#39;The Soup&#39; or something funny on TiVo. The kid will occasionally join us. Eventually, breakfast is at a place down the street called Paty&#39;s. And we always have some kind of great dinner - my wife makes a great roast beef.</p><p>There is not a lot of separation between work and home life.</p><p>A house is no home unless it contain food and fire for the mind as well as for the body.</p><p>I&#39;m still that little girl who lisped and sat in the back of the car and threw vegetables at the back of her head when we drove home from the market. That never goes.</p><p>There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way.</p><p>My restless, roaming spirit would not allow me to remain at home very long.</p><p>My wife was delighted with the home I had given her amid the prairies of the far west.</p><p>The first presentation of my show was given in May, 1883, at Omaha, which I had then chosen as my home. From there we made our first summer tour, visiting practically every important city in the country.</p><p>With the help of a friend I got father into a wagon, when the crowd had gone. I held his head in my lap during the ride home. I believed he was mortally wounded. He had been stabbed down through the kidneys, leaving an ugly wound.</p><p>I had no books at home. I started to frequent a public library in Lisbon. It was there, with no help except curiosity and the will to learn, that my taste for reading developed and was refined.</p><p>It&#39;s simple: You get a part. You play a part. You play it well. You do your work and you go home. And what is wonderful about movies is that once they&#39;re done, they belong to the people. Once you make it, it&#39;s what they see. That&#39;s where my head is at.</p><p>In the true sense one&#39;s native land, with its background of tradition, early impressions, reminiscences and other things dear to one, is not enough to make sensitive human beings feel at home.</p><p>A novelist is, like all mortals, more fully at home on the surface of the present than in the ooze of the past.</p><p>So I got home, and the phone was ringing. I picked it up, and said &#39;Who&#39;s speaking please?&#39; And a voice said &#39;You are.&#39;</p><p>What the New Yorker calls home would seem like a couple of closets to most Americans, yet he manages not only to live there but also to grow trees and cockroaches right on the premises.</p><p>It&#39;s a miracle was the last track recorded for the album, we based it on the rhythm from the middle of &#39;Late Home Tonight, where there&#39;s Graham Broad playing lots and lots of drums with me shouting in the background, pretending to be a mad Arab leader.</p><p>When we root-root-root for the home team, we&#39;re rooting for our home as much as the team.</p><p>Home base is the support system where we have a culinary team, my own writers because of the shows and the books and stuff, we have a culinary team of about six people. Marketing, public relations, accounting and all that sort of stuff.</p><p>My home has always been show business.</p><p>So, we come out to Los Angeles. And we met with every network. We met with show runners, directors, writers, everything. And what we had an idea for, they didn&#39;t like. And what they had an idea for, we didn&#39;t like. So, we went home.</p><p>Home is, I suppose just a child&#39;s idea. A house at night, and a lamp in the house. A place to feel safe.</p><p>I always knew who I was and where I had come from. I was not looking for a home in other people&#39;s lands.</p><p>I think I started learning lessons about being a good person long before I ever knew what basketball was. And that starts in the home, it starts with the parental influence.</p><p>I don&#39;t go to premieres. I don&#39;t go to parties. I don&#39;t covet the Oscar. I don&#39;t want any of that. I don&#39;t go out. I just have dinner at home every night with my kids. Being famous, that&#39;s a whole other career. And I haven&#39;t got any energy for it.</p><p>Most fathers don&#39;t see the war within the daughter, her struggles with conflicting images of the idealized and flawed father, her temptation both to retreat to Daddy&#39;s lap and protection and to push out of his embrace to that of beau and the world beyond home.</p><p>But Vegas is really my first home.</p><p>His claim to his home is deep, but there are too many ghosts. He must absorb without being absorbed.</p><p>The best thing for me is, when I&#39;m not working, is to be at home and to have a script or two scripts is better, and to be just walking around the house and just thinking about the lines.</p><p>If I don&#39;t get paid I&#39;m going to take a whole lot of Marshall amps home with me on the plane.</p><p>Having been let out of the barn once, I know I wouldn&#39;t be happy if I were home all the time.</p><p>My work in the House of Representatives, at this time in my life, is completed. It is time to return home.</p><p>I&#39;m a firm believer that lighting affects mood, and twinkly lights on strings bring something magical to occasions ranging from concerts to weddings, though I&#39;m fond of using them as year-round home decor. There&#39;s a reason why they&#39;re sometimes called fairy lights. When the night is right, there aren&#39;t any strings at all.</p><p>Education was the most important value in our home when I was growing up. People don&#39;t always realize that my parents shared a sense of intellectual curiosity and a love of reading and of history.</p><p>But I do believe that a woman&#39;s truest place is in a home, with a husband and with children, and with large freedom, pecuniary freedom, personal freedom, and the right to vote.</p><p>My wife and I had decided not to let anybody take pictures of our home because it was just the last place on earth we had that was unscathed. But people have climbed over the fence they&#39;ve taken aerial shots. They&#39;ve gotten my address and put it on the Internet.</p><p>I love being home at Christmastime.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m working on an oil rig right now. I&#39;m away from home a lot.</p><p>Most of American life consists of driving somewhere and then returning home, wondering why the hell you went.</p><p>I&#39;m a home cook and love to read about food, but I&#39;m not trained as a chef. I&#39;m just really into cooking and passionate about it.</p><p>Being from Africa is the best thing that could have ever, ever happened to me. I cannot see it any other way. All of my fundamental principles that were instilled in me in my home, from my childhood, are still with me.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen the greatest actors in the world, transcendent talents, who can&#39;t find a home.</p><p>Once I am in the square circle, I am in my home.</p><p>And, you know, being able to wear the stars and stripes, when you step up on one of the blocks or, you know, when you step off of an airplane or when you hear the national anthem play, you know, it&#39;s one of the greatest feelings in the world because you know that there are people at home who are supporting you and watching you.</p><p>The people recognize themselves in their commodities they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment.</p><p>The only instrument I can play is piano. Whenever I make songs at home, I play the piano and make them on the piano.</p><p>We have to judge politicians by their cumulative score. In one innings they make a great catch, in another they drop the ball. In one they score a home run, in another they strike out. But it is their cumulative batting average that we are interested in.</p><p>In Afghanistan, there is a plan to build democracy hundreds of thousands of troops are protecting it. There is a plan to rebuild and reconstruct there. But many thousands of Americans die from violence and poverty every year and we don&#39;t have a plan for reconstruction at home.</p><p>I grew up in a house where my father encouraged my brother and me to fail. I specifically remember coming home and saying, &#39;Dad, Dad, I tried out for this or that and I was horrible,&#39; and he would high-five me and say, &#39;Way to go.&#39;</p><p>My humanitarian work evolved from being with my family. My mom, my dad, they really set a great example for giving back. My mom was a nurse, my dad was a school teacher. But my mom did a lot of things for geriatrics and elderly people. She would do home visits for free.</p><p>And I think what people in New Jersey have gotten to know about me over the last decade that I&#39;ve been in public life is what you see is what you get. And I&#39;m no different when I&#39;m sitting with you than I am when I&#39;m at home or anyplace else.</p><p>But as far as Twitter, I&#39;ll be in a restaurant and I&#39;ll get home and somebody tweeted and they talked about what I ordered and what I was wearing. In some cases, that could be dangerous, because you don&#39;t want everybody to know where you are every second of every day.</p><p>I&#39;m a private person too, and we don&#39;t ever film anything in our home because it&#39;s off limits. It&#39;s like letting people see your messy house.</p><p>If you&#39;re not a competitor, you&#39;ve just got to go home.</p><p>Not much shocked me. You know, I worked in a home for Alzheimer&#39;s patients and my dad used to be really into murders and stuff, so I saw dead bodies. It desensitised me to a lot of things.</p><p>I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.</p><p>I never remember having a plan. All I could think about was how I was going to afford to get into college or where I was going to stay because I hated being at home. I didn&#39;t really have time to think about anything in the future. I didn&#39;t think about a career or anything. I went to uni, got a couple of jobs, so I sort of funded it myself.</p><p>When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home.</p><p>The bullied straight kid goes home to a shoulder to cry on and support and can talk freely about his experience at school and why he&#39;s being bullied. I couldn&#39;t go home and open up to my parents.</p><p>When I met my husband, I refused to invite him home for Passover because I was embarrassed my mother might serve all the catered dishes in the wrong order.</p><p>You make movies for the people. If critics happen to like them too, well, that&#39;s a home run.</p><p>Women are oppressed in the east, in the west, in the south, in the north. Women are oppressed inside, outside home, a woman is oppressed in religion, she is oppressed outside religion.</p><p>A man&#39;s home may seem to be his castle on the outside inside is more often his nursery.</p><p>I can&#39;t drag myself away from &#39;Final Cut Pro.&#39; It is a digital video editing system. I am obsessed with it, but I am always away from home, and I can&#39;t use it.</p><p>When I do get free time, I spend a lot of it at home with my family and my close friends and I think that&#39;s what keeps me happy, healthy, grounded, and totally in check.</p><p>I can write pretty much anywhere if you give me time and some quiet. The home is not usually the best place because I have four children. It&#39;s usually pandemonium around here!</p><p>Baseball is like driving, it&#39;s the one who gets home safely that counts.</p><p>Anyone that has a job that takes them away from home, I think, can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency, not only with your family and those you love but with your friends.</p><p>I often feel very guilty because of the time that I spend outside of my home and the little time that sometimes I have for my kids.</p><p>I have a fantastic studio in my home, and it&#39;s my biggest toy. I have about a half a million dollars worth of musical equipment in my house.</p><p>I had known Cole Porter in Hollywood and New York, spent many a warm hour at his home, and met the talented and original people who were drawn to him.</p><p>I have a three-year-old and a four-year-old at home, and my mornings are about just dealing with the fact of that. I oddly enjoy it.</p><p>I have a five year-old son and a three year-old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home. And I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments.</p><p>I was taught a lot of Bible at home and had a voracious appetite for reading the Bible.</p><p>Dreams are where we visit the many lands and landscapes of human possibility and discover the one where we feel at home. The great religious leaders were all dreamers.</p><p>We need to rediscover the idea of the common good and work together to build a home.</p><p>The message of Passover remains as powerful as ever. Freedom is won not on the battlefield but in the classroom and the home. Teach your children the history of freedom if you want them never to lose it.</p><p>If you live in a good neighborhood, you drive home and there&#39;s a bank. There&#39;s grocery stores and big houses - but no motels. What that tells you psychologically is you protect your money and buy good things for your family to eat in your nice big house.</p><p>When I was 14, I felt very rundown I had a home to go to, but I felt like I was 60 or something, older than I feel now. And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s something that happens at 14, or whether it was adolescence or whether I was gay, or closeted gay, or whatever it was, I felt that.</p><p>I think it can be hard for any man to sometimes be upstaged by his wife. So when I&#39;m home, I work very hard to be Todd&#39;s wife and Jade&#39;s mother. I have no problem going back to those traditional roles. I try to be Giada, the young girl that he met 20 years ago and fell in love with.</p><p>At home, you always have to be a politician when you&#39;re abroad, you almost feel yourself a statesman.</p><p>My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There&#39;s no way I can control him. I wouldn&#39;t stay married to him if I felt I could. I can readily take my business personality into the home. But he forces me to be a partner rather than the boss.</p><p>If you&#39;ve gone into a marriage and you haven&#39;t been clear about how you&#39;re going to handle money, how you want to raise kids, who is going to work or stay home or what have you, then you&#39;ve set yourself up for failure.</p><p>So long as I can stay mentally alert - inquiring, curious - I want to keep going. I love my wife and my children, but I don&#39;t want to sit around at home with them. We go on safaris and things like that. I can do that for a couple of weeks a year. I&#39;m just not ready to stop, to die.</p><p>Everybody at home speaks mandarin except me.</p><p>The wonderful world of home appliances now makes it possible to cook indoors with charcoal and outdoors with gas.</p><p>It is often easier to become outraged by injustice half a world away than by oppression and discrimination half a block from home.</p><p>I&#39;ve been a very lucky guy. I played on championship teams. I played for Canada. I&#39;ve won some awards and I&#39;m very proud of those accomplishments. But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything greater than to come home and to be recognized at home. This is the pinnacle.</p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong - I&#39;ve gone to a club. But I&#39;d much rather be with my close friends at home or a concert, or on a trip. I&#39;ll go dancing with my grandma. She likes to cut a rug!</p><p>By measuring the proportion of children living with the same parents from birth and whether their parents report a good quality relationship we are driving home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown.</p><p>There are 80 million moms in the United States. Forty million stay at home with their children.</p><p>I was lucky. My family is wonderful. And it&#39;s funny, because most of my best friends come from very large families. So it always felt as if I had lots of siblings, though in the end I had to leave them and go home. I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.</p><p>I&#39;m lucky that my real-life Mom has both a great sense of humor about herself and an amazing ability to slip into complete denial if the subject matter gets a little too close to home.</p><p>When I&#39;m at home in Virginia, I become more hermit-like. I like my own home.</p><p>It&#39;s like kids playing house: &#39;You play the father, I&#39;ll play the mother.&#39; You know, you dress up, you play, they pay, you go home. It&#39;s a game - acting&#39;s a game.</p><p>I&#39;ve always taken my love of children from my father. He was a children magnet. Suddenly, having my first child hit home what my dad went through.</p><p>There&#39;s definitely space for uniqueness in a home console.</p><p>A good wife is someone who thinks she has done everything right: raising the kids, being there for the husband, being home, trying to do it all.</p><p>David Lee Roth had the idea that if you covered a successful song, you were half way home. C&#39;mon - Van Halen doing &#39;Dancing in the Streets&#39;? It was stupid. I started feeling like I would rather bomb playing my own songs than be successful playing someone else&#39;s music.</p><p>When I&#39;m home on a break, I lock myself in my room and play guitar. After two or three hours, I start getting into this total meditation. It&#39;s a feeling few people experience, and that&#39;s usually when I come up with weird stuff. It just flows. I can&#39;t force myself. I don&#39;t sit down and say I&#39;ve got to practice.</p><p>The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for a suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its home for life. For this task, it has a rudimentary nervous system. When it finds its spot and takes root, it doesn&#39;t need its brain anymore so it eats it!</p><p>I have always drawn strength from being close to home.</p><p>The show doesn&#39;t drive home a lesson, but it can open up people&#39;s minds enough for them to see how stupid every kind of prejudice can be.</p><p>My idea of heaven used to be relaxing at home with a cheese plate and champagne.</p><p>And it took me, since I was 17 and left home, running from God, to now, as a 30-year-old man, when I honestly feel like I&#39;ve come full circle and my heart&#39;s finally in the right place.</p><p>I hit the ground running, without a lot of training, so I had to do whatever I could do to survive as a professional, and if that meant being that character 24/7 and acting out, I was going to do that. I lived those characters, I brought them home with me.</p><p>I bought a Yamaha-1 and I was doing 180 miles per hour home on the 405 and that&#39;s really, really crazy but I did it.</p><p>The thing I like about baseball is that it&#39;s one-on-one. You stand up there alone, and if you make a mistake, it&#39;s your mistake. If you hit a home run, it&#39;s your home run.</p><p>Just as the police review their operational tactics, so we in the Home Office will review the powers available to the police.</p><p>Hit a home run - put your head down, drop the bat, run around the bases, because the name on the front is more - a lot more important than the name on the back.</p><p>No, I can tell you one of the first things that happens to a home secretary when they arrive in the job is that they are given a briefing about the security matters that they will be dealing with and I deal with security matters on a daily basis.</p><p>Believe me, you can get into a lot of trouble being sixteen years old in a foreign country with no adult telling you when to come home.</p><p>I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.</p><p>I have lived in Mumbai for more than 20 years, have my domicile here, my home and family here.</p><p>I&#39;m lucky. The best possible place in the world for training is Addis Ababa, so I am home all the time except when I am racing. I like to be there, near my family, my kids, also the real estate business I run with my wife.</p><p>When I make a film I&#39;m away from home for two to three months. So I want my kids to look at my films one day and say, I love his movies, I love his choices-because he loved them.</p><p>How we are using up our home, how we are living and polluting the planet is frightening. It was evident when I was a child. It&#39;s more evident now.</p><p>I would drive home and see people wearing my No. 34 jersey and wonder why, because I didn&#39;t feel worthy of that. And all the time I just knew people were staring at me, talking about me everywhere I went.</p><p>I&#39;m kind of a dork. I don&#39;t have much game. I&#39;m not particularly comfortable in bars or clubs. I much prefer being home playing Scrabble, having dinner with a couple friends, going to see a movie, or losing a whole weekend to Season 14 of Law and Order or The Simpsons.</p><p>Entertainers are there to entertain. They aren&#39;t there to teach your children the lessons that you haven&#39;t bothered to teach them at home yourself.</p><p>I like spending time at home. In Paris, people drop by and have a bite to eat, or they drop by and watch Friends on TV. I take my dog to the office there, and I walk to work sometimes.</p><p>Words today are like the shells and rope of seaweed which a child brings home glistening from the beach and which in an hour have lost their luster.</p><p>Especially when you play at home, you need a good atmosphere behind you.</p><p>I&#39;ve never been a hands-on dad. I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it, but you can&#39;t run a restaurant and be home for tea at 4:30 and bath and change nappies.</p><p>We want you to sit down and leave your egos at home and let&#39;s get an understanding as to where all this is foolishness coming from. There are others who are putting things out there or throwing a stick and hiding their hand and keeping things built up in the media.</p><p>The best thing that ever happened to me is that nothing happened in writing. I ended up working for engineering companies, and that&#39;s where I found my material, in the everyday struggle between capitalism and grace. Being broke and tired, you don&#39;t come home your best self.</p><p>The silver and black may have another home, but the Raiders will always belong to the people of Los Angeles.</p><p>I am delighted to be back home in Galway, the place I first came to as a 19-year-old in 1960. It&#39;s here where my heart is and will forever be.</p><p>Actors always talk about taking their work home and I always think: &#39;What are you on? You just turn it off. You are at work and then you go home.&#39;</p><p>The warrior may fight for gold or for an immediate gain, or for something to take home for the winter to feed the family. The soldier is part of a more complex society. He&#39;s fighting for a group ethic of some sort.</p><p>We used to go to the pictures every Saturday night but we had to leave a little bit early and get home and watch Match of the Day - and my wife still complains she missed the last five minutes of every film we saw.</p><p>When my mother got home from work, she would take me to the movies. It was her way of getting out, and she would take me with her. I&#39;d go home and act all the parts. It had a tremendous influence on my becoming an actor.</p><p>When I was doing &#39;Scarface,&#39; I remember being in love at that time. One of the few times in my life. And I was so glad it was at that time. I would come home and she would tell me about her life that day and all her problems and I remember saying to her, look, you really got me through this picture because I would shed everything when I came home.</p><p>You&#39;re always tellin&#39; me to go out more, Go ahead, get out and see the world, But then I think, why should I? I&#39;d rather stay home and cry.</p><p>I really like having a life outside work. I sometimes wish I did more career stuff and was in that Hollywood scene a bit more. But Toronto&#39;s my home.</p><p>My family went through divorces and remarriages and the later, blended home - and then watched that home explode, too.</p><p>Spare a thought for the poor introverts among us. In a world of party animals and glad-handers, they&#39;re the ones who stand by the punch bowl. In a world of mixers and pub crawls, they prefer to stay home with a book. Everywhere around them, cell phones ring and e-mails chime and they just want a little quiet.</p><p>There&#39;s only one thing harder than living in a home with an adolescent - and that&#39;s being an adolescent. The moodiness, the volatility, the wholesale lack of impulse control, all would be close to clinical conditions if they occurred at another point in life. In adolescence, they&#39;re just part of the behavioral portfolio.</p><p>Coming home to my family afterward makes the work richer, easier and more fun.</p><p>Our children&#39;s health and well-being are dependent on our commitment to promoting food access and good eating habits at home, at school and in the community.</p><p>Pride, avarice, and envy are in every home.</p><p>Many working mothers feel guilty about not being at home. And when they are there, they wish it could be perfect. This pressure to make every minute happy puts working parents in a bind when it comes to setting limits and modifying behavior.</p><p>You want to come home to a nice firm bed with the corners tucked in so you start over, like each night is like a new night.</p><p>Drama can feel like therapy whereas comedy feels like there&#39;s been a pressure and a weight lifted off of you. You come to work and you laugh all day, you go home and you feel light and there&#39;s a certain feeling when you&#39;re sitting with the audience and they leave after 90 minutes and it&#39;s just pure escapism and they&#39;re happy.</p><p>Even cooking at home, the difference between my wife cooking and me cooking is major. When my wife cooks, the kitchen looks like a disaster. When I cook it&#39;s completely clean and organized and it doesn&#39;t look like anyone has been cooking in there.</p><p>You come to work and you laugh all day, you go home and you feel light and there&#39;s a certain feeling when you&#39;re sitting with the audience and they leave after 90 minutes and it&#39;s just pure escapism and they&#39;re happy.</p><p>Most cooks try to learn by making dishes. Doesn&#39;t mean you can cook. It means you can make that dish. When you can cook is when you can go to a farmers market, buy a bunch of stuff, then go home and make something without looking at a recipe. Now you&#39;re cooking.</p><p>When I get old, I&#39;m going to the old folks&#39; home. I don&#39;t want to be one of those guys who&#39;s hanging around the house bothering the kids. But not just any old folks&#39; home. I want the whole top floor.</p><p>We&#39;re adults. We&#39;re the ones who should teach the kids what&#39;s good to eat. I don&#39;t think the government should ever regulate what we eat at home, but we&#39;re feeding them in school with tax dollars. Quite frankly, if my tax dollars are being spent to feed kids, I&#39;d rather feed them better food.</p><p>I&#39;m a married man. If I want sex at this particular point in my life, I go home for it.</p><p>The environment doesn&#39;t change that radically. You are still going to go home at night and NBC is going to be there, ABC and CBS will still be there.</p><p>I don&#39;t need to be asking for money for local museums and other projects just to make me look good back home.</p><p>In the mind, in the heart, I was always home. I always imagined, really, going back home.</p><p>You earn very little money on independent films and I&#39;m the provider for my home, so I do have to think of taking one for the accountant time and again and that means studio pictures.</p><p>I was living on the wrong side of the tracks in Evanston, Illinois, in a home for boys. We had these Jackson 5 records. I really related to their voices - they were about my age, but they were doing it.</p><p>I&#39;m like a really goofy home ec teacher.</p><p>I know people that could serve me canned tuna and saltine crackers and have me feel more at home at their table than some people who can cook circles around me. The more you try to impress people, generally the less you do.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing like a good cheating song to make me want to run home to be with my wife.</p><p>They pick all of us out, and then they decide, they computerize, decide if they like it or don&#39;t like it, and then they go home, and then they come back again because they&#39;re not sure what they saw.</p><p>I remind everyone: Whether you school them at home or send them to school, you as a parent have the responsibility to make sure they learn and behave. Teachers and principals may help, but parents are the ones who must accept responsibility.</p><p>I want kids to have a chance to dream of becoming something like I did in my life, and when you&#39;re living in a home that&#39;s dysfunctional and unhealthy that way, you don&#39;t dream like that.</p><p>The hardest thing is spending twelve hours a day accommodating the rest of the world, then going home at night and criticizing it. I would be curious about what I&#39;d write if I didn&#39;t have to worry about offending.</p><p>Like most citizens of popular and international urban centres, I don&#39;t take advantage of the cultural opportunities. Perhaps this comes from growing up in suburbia. Home is where you eat, sleep, read, watch television and ignore your parents. It is not where you go to the ballet and then attend a heated panel discussion about it afterwards.</p><p>If I go into a sandwich shop or anywhere that features &#39;Today&#39;s specials&#39; on a chalkboard more than 10 feet away, I have to ask for a printed menu. I smile at people I don&#39;t know on the street and ignore those I do. When at home, I often find myself grabbing my &#39;back-up&#39; glasses to search for the better-loved pair I have left on top of my dresser.</p><p>However, I was a restaurant critic at Chicago magazine before I worked at Esquire, and I&#39;ve been a really enthusiastic home cook for a long time. It&#39;s just something I&#39;m passionate about.</p><p>When I come home from a shoot, I&#39;d rather reheat food I&#39;ve made than eat takeout.</p><p>I chose America as my home because I value freedom and democracy, civil liberties and an open society.</p><p>While I enjoy spending time in L.A., Britain is my home.</p><p>I think I&#39;m becoming more relaxed in front of a camera. I suppose I&#39;ll always feel slightly more at home on stage. It&#39;s more of an actor&#39;s medium. You are your own editor, nobody else is choosing what is being seen of you.</p><p>I&#39;ve now been in this country for thirteen years, since I was seventeen. So this is my second home.</p><p>I really see myself as a homegirl. Wales is my first home. London is my second home - I&#39;ve been there 14 years now.</p><p>I love coming back to Neath - this is home and always will be.</p><p>Oh, stuff the critics. I don&#39;t care. Too many people are snooty about classical. Look, I wasn&#39;t brought up in a home where we listened to classical music. It was a singing teacher that thought it would be best for my voice. Then I moved into crossover. And if that makes the music accessible to more people, then great.</p><p>I&#39;m launching my own festival in South Wales. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted to do for a long time. It&#39;s going to be held at Margam Park, because I wanted the venue to be as close to my home as possible.</p><p>I wish I got a little bit more time at home. I am away a lot and being around my loved ones and friends is good for me. It grounds me. It&#39;s something I need to make more time for. I think I need a little more balance.</p><p>I go home and don&#39;t get treated any differently. People have known me all my life and are interested and very supportive but because they have known me forever I don&#39;t get any diva treatment. My mum still tells me off if I haven&#39;t loaded the dishwasher for her.</p><p>With all the hundreds of dresses and shoes I have, it would be an absolute crime if I don&#39;t have a little girl. I have a whole room at home filled with my stage wear.</p><p>In general, shorter is better. If you can encapsulate your idea into a single captivating sentence, you&#39;re halfway home.</p><p>I don&#39;t like travelling. Which is ridiculous. And it&#39;s not because I&#39;m afraid of dying on the plane or anything. I just like to stay at home.</p><p>The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren&#39;t thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about - they weren&#39;t putting electricity into the home. They were putting lighting into the home.</p><p>The one thing that offends me the most is when I walk by a bank and see ads trying to convince people to take out second mortgages on their home so they can go on vacation. That&#39;s approaching evil.</p><p>The relevance for 9/11 is that what 9/11 marked was the beginning of a struggle in which the terrorists come at us and strike us here on our home territory. And it&#39;s a global operation. It doesn&#39;t know national boundaries or national borders.</p><p>An education program is, by definition, a societal program. Work should be done at school, rather than at home.</p><p>I&#39;m not squeamish at all. As a child I dragged a dead squirrel home on my skateboard and cut it open and tried to look at its brain.</p><p>Events at home, at work, in the street - these are the bases for a story.</p><p>I remember when I came home from the hospital after having my son, I wore a Narciso Rodriguez black coat. Then, I was using this fragrance that I had created. I walk by that coat, and it still smells like that fragrance. It takes you right there.</p><p>And I came back and it was great, &#39;cuz George had set up all these flowers all over the studio saying welcome home. So then we got it together again. I always felt it was better on the White one for me. We were more like a band, you know.</p><p>I&#39;m just like so many women - I was frustrated, I had these white pants that I had spent a lot of money on, and you get home and you think, &#39;What am I really supposed to wear under this?&#39; So it was a frustrated consumer moment.</p><p>I believe that parents need to make nutrition education a priority in their home environment. It&#39;s crucial for good health and longevity to instill in your children sound eating habits from an early age.</p><p>The thing about being at home versus being out in the world working is, it&#39;s a whole different vibe. When I&#39;m home with my kids and partner, I will cook - even though she&#39;s a very good cook. She&#39;s learned over the years. We started with basics, you know, how to saute onions, how to saute mushrooms.</p><p>If eating out, order your meal and ask the server to wrap up half of the portion to take home with your for the next day, keeping your portion size in check, and stretching your dollar into two meals.</p><p>I&#39;ve been experimenting more and more with LN2, liquid nitrogen. I&#39;ve used it in battle on &#39;Iron Chef America,&#39; but have also made some great ice creams at home for my family. Since it freezes basically on contact, you can have ice cream ready in mere minutes.</p><p>When I&#39;m home, the heart and soul of our family is in the kitchen. Growing up, my parents both worked, so dinnertime was for family - the TV was off. I think it&#39;s important to grab that time and really make it special, even after a tough day.</p><p>From the moment this baby came into our home, those two dogs have never been more in love. It&#39;s the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever witnessed. People keep saying, &#39;Oh, you&#39;re a single mom.&#39; I&#39;m like, &#39;Actually, I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve got two boys helping.&#39;</p><p>The earth is my altar, the sky is my dome, mind is my garden, the heart is my home and I&#39;m always at home - yea, I&#39;m always at Om.</p><p>A girl&#39;s got to do what she&#39;s got to do to make somebody pay her a compliment. If that means moaning &#39;til the cows come home, then so be it.</p><p>I carry groceries home on the tank of my motorcycle.</p><p>I race historic muscle cars back in Australia, and that&#39;s my hobby. And I try to race home as soon as I&#39;ve finished a movie but don&#39;t tell anyone.</p><p>My grandmother always taught me, &#39;If you don&#39;t have a home, family, and church, you don&#39;t have anything.&#39;</p><p>When I go on the plane to fly home, I&#39;m literally capable of forgetting what I do for a job. That also comes about because I choose to take massive breaks between projects, and because I choose to do this ridiculous thing of keeping home, home.</p><p>Family makes a house a home.</p><p>When I shoot I&#39;ll take my family with me - one movie a year and then the rest of the time at home.</p><p>I don&#39;t get a chance to be home much.</p><p>I love being at home, being with friends and family. I&#39;m of European stock, brought up in Australia. I&#39;m a passionate guy. I just love life.</p><p>Music is my home.</p><p>Irish women are always carrying water on their heads, and always carrying their husbands home from pubs. Such things are the greatest posture-builders in the world.</p><p>I cook all my meals at home.</p><p>My mother is a special story. She went through so much to bring us up, four men at home, especially when our country was going through really difficult times.</p><p>I have a life that I enjoy I try and value the things that I think are worth valuing and everything else is icing. You know, it is a kick to go down the red carpet in that dress and then you go back home.</p><p>I consider myself a product of Alaska. The love and the debt that I feel to my home state, you always want your hometown to be the proudest of you.</p><p>But you know, there&#39;s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention - they go home, they&#39;re finished. They don&#39;t stall, they don&#39;t do their homework in front of the TV.</p><p>I met a lot of great people in Saudi Arabia and I&#39;d like to see them again. And I&#39;d love to spend more time in the desert and in the mountains. I felt really at home there.</p><p>I believe that the fight against crime starts in the home. Parents must take responsibility for their children and show them love and guidance from an early age so they learn to respect the rights of others.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had WiFi at home. I&#39;m too easily distracted, and YouTube is too tempting.</p><p>I&#39;ve done a lot of partying in my time because I didn&#39;t want to go home and I didn&#39;t know what to do.</p><p>I like to listen to mellow stuff on the road like Travis, as we are constantly surrounded by rock music on tour and so its nice listening to mellow stuff. Obviously back at home I listen to a lot more rock music.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to get home from work and wonder if I could have done better if I didn&#39;t go out that night. What you&#39;re doing is going to go on the big screen and go down in history.</p><p>My favorite show is America&#39;s Funniest Home Videos. People will get hit on the head and I feel bad cause I&#39;m laughing my head off!</p><p>The thrill of coming home has never changed.</p><p>I&#39;m kind of a homebody. My husband says I like to just stay home and do nothing, but that&#39;s just how I am.</p><p>I saw the president make the tough calls in the Situation Room - and today, our troops in Iraq have finally come home so America can do some nation building here at home. That was the change that we believed in. That was the change we fought for. That was the change President Obama delivered.</p><p>Everywhere you hang your hat is home. Home is the bright cave under the hat.</p><p>When I am made fun of in the press I just remember those days when I&#39;d come home to find that the water had been turned off because my mother couldn&#39;t afford the bill. Suddenly, everything feels easier.</p><p>Having robbed children of any sense that their Father is in Heaven and that they are His creation, we then launched an experiment in raising them without earthly fathers too. Having neither a Father in heaven or a father in the home, many young men make gangs their families.</p><p>Do I ever think Gossip will be really massive in America? No, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll happen - and that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s kind of nice because I get to experience everything at once. I get to come home and it not be weird, like in Paris or something. It is nice to be completely anonymous.</p><p>As the prospect of a Tory government gets nearer, many traditional Labour voters - some who switched away in recent times and many who stayed at home - seem more determined to prevent that happening.</p><p>I feel an obligation to set the record straight. Actors that say they&#39;re affected by something, that it changes their life, that they take it home with them, they&#39;re just trying to get nominated for an Oscar!</p><p>When I was younger, my coach, Liang Chow, made all the decisions. I would go to the gym for practice, do exactly what Chow told me to do, go home, come back and start all over again. If Chow told me to do 50 squat jumps, I did 50 squat jumps.</p><p>I keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it.</p><p>New England is the home of all that is good and noble with all her sternness and uncompromising opinions.</p><p>The aesthetic came along the way, I think - just through experimenting, and going on tour, and trying stuff out on stage, having fun with it, and not taking it too seriously. If I had a ballgown at home, I&#39;d wear it onstage. If I found something in a charity shop, I&#39;d wear it. That&#39;s where it grew from - just wanting to play dress-up.</p><p>Mr. Bean is at his best when he is not using words, but I am equally at home in both verbal and nonverbal expression.</p><p>Confronting a stadium audience, you can&#39;t see the whites of their eyes. It&#39;s just an amorphous mass of noise and, of course, you can&#39;t see the alleged billions watching at home either, so the degree to which you are intimidated is quite low.</p><p>Obviously, the easiest recipes are the most successful when it comes to the home cook, because they&#39;re not intimidated by them. If I&#39;m doing &#39;Boy Meets Grill,&#39; and I do something very simple like grilled hamburgers or steaks or chicken, those are the most sought-after recipes.</p><p>I can&#39;t grill vegetables, shellfish or steaks without tongs. Don&#39;t bother with those long-handled grilling tongs normally found in the BBQ section of your home store. Get intimate with your grill and opt for the regular stainless steel tongs.</p><p>I think my children know that Mother&#39;s priority is to be with them first. But I don&#39;t think it has to be an either/or situation. Work is very important to me, and it wouldn&#39;t be in the best interest of my children for me to stay home seven days a week.</p><p>Once you&#39;re halfway home, you know that you can probably get the rest of the way there.</p><p>Most of us in the baby-boom generation were raised by full-time mothers. Even as recently as 14 years ago, 6 out of 10 mothers with babies were staying at home. Today that is totally reversed. Does that mean we love our children less than our mothers loved us? No, but it certainly causes a lot of guilt trips.</p><p>I grew up in a very toxic home.</p><p>A nutritionist helps me eat healthily at home.</p><p>At home it&#39;s all Batman and Star Wars and they do gang up on me. Sometimes I don&#39;t want to dress up as Darth Vader or play train sets, so I&#39;ll go out for a drink with the girls.</p><p>I really don&#39;t like to do back-to-back movies. I concentrate on things at home. My family and school life are important to me. I try to do one movie a year.</p><p>With fiction, you can talk about plot, character and narrative, whereas a poem brings home the fact that everything that happens in a work of literature happens in terms of language. And this is daunting stuff to deal with.</p><p>I tentatively believe in a god. I was brought up in a fairly religious home. I think the world is compatible with reincarnation, karma, all that stuff.</p><p>I&#39;m very lucky. I am one of those people who is able to go home, shut the front door and completely focus on the kids.</p><p>Acting is probably the greatest therapy in the world. You can get a lot stuff out of you on the set so you don&#39;t have to take it home with you at night. It&#39;s the stuff between the lines, the empty space between those lines which is interesting.</p><p>I am reasonably happy. I didn&#39;t find Jesus or anything like that. Part of it is that I just feel that I could go home. I did not feel like that for a long time, but I could go back now.</p><p>The technological revolution at home makes it much easier for computers to do our work.</p><p>The American dream seems to be thriving in Europe not at home.</p><p>I am an American citizen and it is my home now. I like the U.S.A., which is not a place too many people have liked since Bush. The U.S. has a young population, and everything can change within a year.</p><p>A kid in an abusive home has far fewer rights than any POW. There is no Geneva Convention for kids.</p><p>My free time at home is usually spent emailing, listening to music, reading and talking on the phone. I wish I was on the phone less, but I have been fortunate to stay in touch with so many incredible friends.</p><p>I grew up in a home environment where I wasn&#39;t getting esteem for anything I did.</p><p>I listen to the phone-ins on the way home and I know how the fans feel.</p><p>Power doesn&#39;t have to be on such a big scale for powerful things to occur. Within your own home, you can be a powerful woman as a mother, influencing your children&#39;s lives.</p><p>Every man who has shown the world the way to beauty, to true culture, has been a rebel, a &#39;universal&#39; without patriotism, without home, who has found his people everywhere.</p><p>The day I finished &#39;Twilight,&#39; I came home and started bulking up. For &#39;New Moon,&#39; I&#39;m 30 pounds heavier than I was in &#39;Twilight.&#39;</p><p>By the time I got home at night, my eyes were so chlorinated I saw rings around every light.</p><p>When I came home for the summer after my first year of college, I told my mother that my best friend and I were driving to California. She laughed out loud - 2,000 miles in a what? Well, my best friend had an old Chevy. What could go wrong?</p><p>In the later books I am much more at home in the use of language to describe things. I had never thought of that until a critic pointed that out.</p><p>I got a scholarship to Seattle University and I was writing arrangements for singers and everybody. But the music course was too dry and I really wanted to get away from home.</p><p>My doctor asked me if I smoked, and I said only when I&#39;m working, golfing, or drinking. Then I realized the only time I don&#39;t smoke is when I&#39;m home. I didn&#39;t even realize I&#39;d become a smoker.</p><p>Unless you have been to boarding-school when you are very young, it is absolutely impossible to appreciate the delights of living at home.</p><p>My mom enlisted in the U.S. Navy in World War II, and my parents actually bought our home thanks to the loan she got through the GI Bill.</p><p>I was not born in a home where there were stereotypes. So that was very useful because it gave me the sense of possibilities, of flying, if I may say, of making my hopes and dreams a reality.</p><p>I was a loner as a child and happiest at home, launching toy rockets and aeroplanes. When I started causing trouble in my third year at grammar school, Mum was really surprised. My parents sent me to a child psychologist, who suggested I might have Asperger&#39;s syndrome.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what my label is. I just think of myself as a plain forward. I like to think I have some finesse to my game, but inside the paint is where men are made. If you can&#39;t play there, you should be home with your mama.</p><p>I&#39;m not afraid to call a wine that tastes like Skittles or green peppers mixed with orange marmalade. I&#39;ll say, &#39;It tastes like chicken.&#39; I mean, that&#39;s not what people think of when they think of wine, but that&#39;s what it tastes like to me and it hits home.</p><p>I&#39;m still really close with everyone at home and their parents - and their brothers and sisters. I was so, so, so lucky to grow up as part of a community and I don&#39;t take that for granted. I try very hard to stay part of it.</p><p>And now, I still really don&#39;t care that much but now I have music playing all the time at home, which is a first for me. Whatever. Everything from Ani DiFranco to Dave Matthews to Jack Johnson and Norah Jones.</p><p>There&#39;s an internal battle. I need to work, I need to work, I need to work and I need to be home with my kids and the kids win.</p><p>My sisters both are working mothers. I understand that my being an actress as well as being at home isn&#39;t some heroic thing. That doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t confusing or difficult - especially that question of how you find a balance.</p><p>This is truly a blessing. Breyon Prescott, Peter Edge and Tom Corson believe in me and have introduced me to a home that also believes and knows exactly what to do with the type of music I&#39;m doing.</p><p>No, let&#39;s make sure that people understand that this is a very important war that is helping to protect us here at home. And that we have no choice but to win it. As difficult as it is.</p><p>Americans, particularly after World War II, tended to romanticize war because in World War II our cause was the cause of humanity, and our soldiers brought home glory and victory, and thank God that they did. But it led us to romanticize it to some extent.</p><p>Five thousand people every day lose their home because of a medical bankruptcy. Most of them had insurance.</p><p>Every woman I&#39;ve had a relationship with has found this maddening the fact that I will talk about anything on the stage, and reveal all this stuff, and yet when I&#39;m at home, I clam up and won&#39;t discuss anything intimate or personal.</p><p>In the holy city of Mecca, violence of any kind was forbidden. From the moment they left home, pilgrims were not permitted to carry weapons, to swat an insect or speak an angry word, a discipline that introduced them to a new way of living.</p><p>At home in Victoria, we have three dogs, Tosh and Lucy, they&#39;re half Blue Heelers, and then there&#39;s Torrin a little Maltese terrier. She gets more attention in the house than anyone else! Yes, I miss them a lot.</p><p>It&#39;s like, now you&#39;re actually complaining because you&#39;re making $9 million and guys are making more? If it makes you that upset, quit. Leave the game. Go home then and try finding another job that&#39;s going to pay you that.</p><p>After all, I long to be in America again, nay, if I can go home to return no more to Europe, it seems to me that I shall ever enjoy more peace of mind, and even Physical comfort than I can meet with in any portion of the world beside.</p><p>In all honesty, at that time, I never saw myself as an author... I was just a Mom in a state of panic, trying to enter a short story contest to win the prize money in order to keep the lights on in my home.</p><p>It&#39;s a sad day when the leaders of the free world engage in such deception and trickery. I voted against this unnecessary war and will continue to argue that the best way to support our troops is to bring them home.</p><p>At one point my dad called me and said, &#39;You have always been a great salesman. I think it&#39;s time you come home and sell swimming pools.&#39;</p><p>When I was a kid I didn&#39;t feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably shouldn&#39;t say it, but, I didn&#39;t think anything was funny. So I used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my step-dad at the time and I didn&#39;t think anything was funny. I couldn&#39;t laugh.</p><p>Great music is its own movie, already. And the challenge, as a music fan, is to keep the song as powerful as it wants to be, to not tamper with it and to somehow give it a home.</p><p>It&#39;s hard for women who make a lot of money and make decisions all day long, then they have to come home and be &#39;Stupid Sally.&#39; Men need respect, and they need to know that they can lead in the relationship, so even if they don&#39;t make the most money they need to be able to call the shots.</p><p>You may not like the idea of putting money into a home when you&#39;re moving out. But it&#39;s demanded by the market. You need to show it off. You don&#39;t have to rip out the kitchen and bathroom. But maybe replace the tiles or the countertops. Get professional advice.</p><p>The most influential factor in selling a home is always price. Don&#39;t build &#39;wiggle room&#39; into the asking price. There&#39;s a price war out there and you have to win it from the get-go.</p><p>I live a dual life. On the red carpet, it&#39;s complete glam. But at home, I&#39;m a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl. Simple can be beautiful.</p><p>You can&#39;t control the paparazzi. But if you go to Coachella you&#39;re going to get photographed. Whereas if you&#39;re at home, walking down the street you probably won&#39;t. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve learnt to navigate my way around but I try to keep my private life private.</p><p>I speak relatively little, except when I&#39;m at home and I&#39;m asking for things.</p><p>When I was at college, I worked in a department store called Brit Home Stores, which is a pretty lackluster department store, selling clothes for middle-aged women. My job was to walk the floor and find anything that was damaged, take it to the store room and log it.</p><p>The 4th Amendment and the personal rights it secures have a long history. At the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.</p><p>Home is where my mom is.</p><p>My home town is very small and very remote and we don&#39;t have a movie house.</p><p>Man hath still either toys or care: But hath no root, nor to one place is tied, but ever restless and irregular, about this earth doth run and ride. He knows he hath a home, but scarce knows where He says it is so far, that he has quite forgot how to go there.</p><p>I practice yoga at home to a TV show called &#39;Inhale,&#39; taught by Steve Ross. I figured that if the people on the show could stretch that deep then I could too. I ended up pulling my hip flexor. But that&#39;s how I met my husband. Paul was the physical therapist my coach called to meet with me after hours.</p><p>Nevertheless most of the evergreen forests of the north must always remain the home of wild animals and trappers, a backward region in which it is easy for a great fur company to maintain a practical monopoly.</p><p>Take, for example, the African jungle, the home of the cheetah. On whom does the cheetah prey? The old, the sick, the wounded, the weak, the very young, but never the strong. Lesson: If you would not be prey, you had better be strong.</p><p>When I was at home, I felt loved and safe. My sisters were always a safe haven for me. I knew they would always play with me and make me feel like I was one of them.</p><p>One thing I&#39;ve been happy as peach pie about - because I&#39;m all about the children and the happiness of a woman because that makes the happiness of the home - is that nannies, day cares and babysitters are all collapsing, which is forcing moms and dads to raise their children at home.</p><p>It&#39;s easier to date a football player for sure. Football players have one game a week, and they practice every day, but they&#39;re all at home. In basketball, they&#39;re on the road all the time.</p><p>I do have 14 tattoos, but I also do come home every single night and watch reality TV with my cat.</p><p>All my day is spent dealing with other people. When I come home I like it to be empty. The presence of others in my house kind of annoys me. I love coming home and shutting the doors. I feel brain dead. I&#39;m relatively available, but not to live with.</p><p>I still cook at home. A lot of chefs I think don&#39;t cook at home. But I still do, I love cooking at home, I love having friends.</p><p>I just moved into a new house, so I love spending time at home. Everything for me is all about self-care because I really feel that if I&#39;m at my best, than I&#39;m able to come to my job and really be feeling the best, so if I&#39;m not working out or going on a hike, than I&#39;m at home recharging and cooking dinner and hanging out with my cat.</p><p>If you&#39;re a misanthrope you stay at home. There are certain writers who really don&#39;t like other people. I&#39;m not like that, I don&#39;t think.</p><p>Secretly, I&#39;m a real big nerd. I&#39;d rather stay home and play Scrabble than go to a Hollywood party, any day of the week. And I love reading about history and watching the Discovery Channel.</p><p>When I began to make some money, I really wanted to have a home.</p><p>I am at home in many cultures. I live actively in three continents and I&#39;ve done that for most of my life, so I just make films as I see the world, and that happens to speak to people. I do things that I want to do.</p><p>Sometimes I do envision just being a stay at home mom but not working isn&#39;t an option for me currently.</p><p>New York City is home to so many people from so many places and the uniqueness of it is that you never feel a foreigner. English is almost hardly ever heard in the subway. In fact, it&#39;s weird.</p><p>We have three generations at home, including my father-in-law. I keep a very low profile, and a lot of things I do are very much with the family in mind. I have actually made films with the family around me.</p><p>I&#39;m hoping someday that some kid, black or white, will hit more home runs than myself. Whoever it is, I&#39;d be pulling for him.</p><p>This whole head of the home thing has been blown way out of proportion. Some guys just take it way too far. Some parents take it way too far. Yet children need guidance. They need a parent to help and guide them. They also need a friend. They need a confidant.</p><p>You know, the sad thing of post-9/11, which was of course horrific, was that the city in which I felt completely at home for two decades, suddenly people like us - brown people - were looked at as the &#39;Others.&#39;</p><p>I play basketball probably four to five days a week when I&#39;m back home.</p><p>It&#39;s not always possible to sit down and eat at home in this day and age of fast-paced living, but if you are going to eat out, do so as a family and support all the great local places in your areas. I&#39;ll still eat at the same diner I did as a kid with my parents.</p><p>I don&#39;t know of a Democrat - whether they&#39;re a conservative, a centrist or a liberal Democrat - that doesn&#39;t think that it&#39;s important to have quality jobs that pay decent wages so that families can support themselves, so that they can have the dignity of being able to afford health care, put money aside for pension, buy a home.</p><p>When we started the show, &#39;Dallas&#39; was known as the city where JFK was assassinated. By the end it was known as JR&#39;s home town.</p><p>I think because my life is so insane and it&#39;s constantly going at 120 miles per hour, my favorite thing to do is sit at home in front of the TV and check out.</p><p>I like to feel the butterflies in the stomach, I like to go home and have a restless night and wonder how I&#39;m going to be able to accomplish this feat, get jittery. That hunger and those butterflies in the stomach are very essential for all creative people.</p><p>I got a telegraph from my mother who said that my step-father had had a heart attack, come home and earn a living. So I went back to England and the only thing I knew to earn any cash was through hairdressing.</p><p>I came home after a year and although my profession was only hairdressing, I knew I could change it.</p><p>Recently I heard a &#39;wise guy&#39; story that I had a party at my home for twenty-five men. It&#39;s an interesting story, but I don&#39;t know twenty-five men I&#39;d want to invite ta a party.</p><p>But inspiration? - That&#39;s when you come home from abroad and are asked: Well, have you found inspiration? - and fortunately you haven&#39;t. But the impressions sink in, of course, and may emerge later: None of us has invented the house that was done many thousands of years ago.</p><p>I have two homes in Malibu, a home in Canada that I&#39;m building, and I just love pouring my heart out into this part of my life.</p><p>The coolest thing, and I have it at home, is a huge Hulk Hogan, normal-sized pinball machine. When people come over they play it for hours. When you hit the bumpers and the bells ring it goes, &#39;Oh yeah!&#39; The whole time you&#39;re playing this machine it&#39;s yelling and screaming at you, &#39;What you gonna do, brother?!&#39; I think that&#39;s the coolest.</p><p>To be honest, I find going out pretty scary and intimidating. Got all those people checking you out, with only one purpose: hooking up. I&#39;m quite the dork, I&#39;d rather sit home and play Scrabble. But that doesn&#39;t get you a girl, does it?</p><p>I think any branding for me is band-related. It&#39;s really weird to get used to the exposure, because I am a naturally introverted person, and I&#39;m not exactly social. Occasionally I can get comfortable enough to talk, but I spend a lot of my days not talking, especially when I&#39;m at home and not on tour.</p><p>But for me, I thought you made a record, you got on a bus, went out and played your shows and made a lot of money. That was the way it was supposed to go down. But there&#39;s a lot more to it than that. There are a lot of early mornings, late nights, a lot of traveling, a lot of being away from home, being away from your family.</p><p>In principle if I could not have a home I wouldn&#39;t. But not having a home would be too difficult procedurally, going from hotel to hotel, the gap of three hours where you&#39;re hungry and tired.</p><p>Reading the play at home, however fulfilling, can never be the vivacious experience that Shakespeare intended.</p><p>I have a little kitchen office at home, where I do all my kids&#39; stuff.</p><p>I think the advent of the Internet gave us all a big boost, because by the time the Internet became mainstream and you could get it in your home, a lot of us were used to dealing in fan culture, writing to magazines or anything at the back of comic books.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m not good with sliminess. I hate the thought of creatures that have slime on them or creatures that leave a slimy trail. At home, the sight of a slug can bring up my breakfast.</p><p>I think it&#39;s really important to give yourself a very big question that you&#39;re working on that you can come home to, even if you, you know, are going to have to go without a cup of coffee or even a meal, that that should nourish you.</p><p>I was from such a large family that when I first met my wife, I told her: &#39;You can go work outside of the house and I&#39;ll stay home and continue making my cartoon strips. Maybe I&#39;ll make some commercials nearby, you know I&#39;ll do anything locally, but I would love to just stay at home and raise the kids like I did when I was growing up.&#39;</p><p>I made a real specific decision when I came out of school and most artists were writing about home - if you were a woman, you were writing about being a woman - and I decided not to do that, write about what you know. That&#39;s not what I do. I went as far away from home as possible in terms of the development of my imagination.</p><p>I love my parents. But I&#39;m almost 28 and it&#39;s not fun to be asked, &#39;What are you doing today? What do you want for dinner? When are you going to be home?&#39; It just makes you feel like a kid. It&#39;s this juxtaposition of feeling annoyed and really lucky to have people who love you so much.</p><p>Christianity is not about religion. It&#39;s about faith, about being held, about being forgiven. It&#39;s about finding joy and finding home.</p><p>I&#39;m always amazed when a pitcher becomes angry at a hitter for hitting a home run off him. When I strike out, I don&#39;t get angry at the pitcher, I get angry at myself. I would think that if a pitcher threw up a home run ball, he should be angry at himself.</p><p>I love home cooking, and I&#39;m not a great one for fast food.</p><p>I try and eat really healthy when I&#39;m home, but I certainly don&#39;t eat worms and snakes.</p><p>I exercise about 40 minutes a day, and I&#39;ll run one day and do circuit training the next day. I live in an area where there are brilliant hills and mountains, so I get a good hill run with my dog. At home, I&#39;ll do the circuit training with old weights, along with pull-ups in the trees and that sort of stuff.</p><p>When I&#39;m filming, survival requires movement. You need your energy, and you&#39;ve got to eat the bad stuff, and survival food is rarely pretty, but you kind of do it. I get in that zone, and I eat the nasty stuff, but I&#39;m not like that when I&#39;m back home.</p><p>Survival requires us to leave our prejudices at home. It&#39;s about doing whatever it takes - and ultimately those with the biggest heart will win.</p><p>I only scream and scratch when something&#39;s only &#39;really good&#39; or &#39;good&#39;, I want to be great, or let&#39;s go home.</p><p>Land is the secure ground of home, the sea is like life, the outside, the unknown.</p><p>Nice to see your home fans boo you. That&#39;s what loyal support is.</p><p>About 15 years ago I went though a period of a year or so when I just couldn&#39;t find anything good. My wife noticed I was having trouble reading menus. I bought some cheap reading glasses in a drug store. I got home and suddenly all these books that weren&#39;t good were good.</p><p>The American consumer is also the American worker, and if we don&#39;t do something to protect our manufacturing base here at home, it is going to be hard to buy any retail goods.</p><p>I went to the store and bought lady fingers, when I got home I noticed one of the fingers was missing so I went back to the store and the manager was nice enough to give me the finger.</p><p>Brazil is where I belong, the place that feels like home. They love their family, their country and God, and are not afraid to let anybody know it.</p><p>At home, growing up, we weren&#39;t really poor. We had everything we needed, we just didn&#39;t have what we wanted.</p><p>He&#39;s a good tough producer, yes. But I don&#39;t think that he&#39;s unreasonable unless he feels threatened. And when somebody&#39;s in your home, I think everybody in the home gets threatened.</p><p>I lived at home till I was 29.</p><p>My folks were raised pure prohibitionist. They were very good people, with high moral standards - but very repressed. There was no hugging and kissing in my home.</p><p>Men can have a huge turnover of sponsorship and still survive a lot better than the women. But the women&#39;s ratings are better, at least at home in the United States than in the men&#39;s tennis.</p><p>I&#39;d rather rot on my own floor than be found by a bunch of bingo players in a nursing home.</p><p>I read the Odyssey because it was the story of a man who returned home after being absent for more than twenty years and was recognized only by his dog.</p><p>On my visits back home, if they saw that I was getting a big head, they&#39;d let me know right away.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, god bless America - land of the free, home of the brave.</p><p>For President Obama, &#39;home of the brave&#39; are not just the last words of our national anthem, but also a call to action. This is why the president&#39;s policies and our platform include incentives to train and hire our troops returning home. Not only because of our moral responsibility, but because it makes for a stronger, more secure American economy.</p><p>It&#39;s not about finding a home so much as finding yourself.</p><p>I spend plenty of time in London and it doesn&#39;t scare me, but it&#39;s a lonely place, even if you&#39;ve got friends there. My job takes me all around the world, meeting lots of interesting people. But I think if I couldn&#39;t get home, if I couldn&#39;t get back to what I consider my real life I&#39;d be frightened.</p><p>My wife is the boss at home, and my daughters are the bosses. I am just the worker. We are a very warm family and very happy.</p><p>Leaving home in a sense involves a kind of second birth in which we give birth to ourselves.</p><p>Every time I took a long leave from home, I felt as if I were going to conquer the world. Or rather, take possession of what is my birthright, my inheritance.</p><p>But, yeah, I&#39;m really happy when I&#39;m writing. When I&#39;m being creative and when I have something that I can put down. You know, if you go out and you overhear a conversation or you have a thought, you have a receptacle to go home and say, &#39;Oh, this would be great in this script.&#39; Your antenna&#39;s out in a different way, and I love that time.</p><p>I do 280 episodes of TV a year, write 15 recipes for the magazine, and publish an annual book. With all of that, we try to get one weekend a month with Isaboo at our home in the Adirondacks to relax and recharge.</p><p>I live in, literally, the same home when I was swiping my first bank card and wondering if I&#39;d have to put back the Charmin. We still don&#39;t have a dishwasher. My mom has done all these gardens so now my house looks like the garden shack in the middle of Versailles.</p><p>I have this extraordinary life during the day, and then I get to come home to my sweet husband who loves to cook with me. I have a nice glass of wine, he has some scotch, we chat, we cook, and we hang out with the dog. I have an absolute dream life.</p><p>Good food and a warm kitchen are what makes a house a home. I always tried to make my home like my mother&#39;s, because Mom was magnificent at stretching a buck when it came to decorating and food. Like a true Italian, she valued beautification in every area of her life, and I try to do the same.</p><p>Praying privately in churches, I began to discover that heaven was my true home and also that it was here and now, woven into this life.</p><p>During the Second World War, evacuated to non-Jewish households, I encountered Christianity at home and in school.</p><p>I fantasize about having a manual job where I can come home at night, read a book and not feel responsible for what will happen the next day.</p><p>I came from a broken home, so my mom was a major influence in my life.</p><p>I want any excuse to come home. My dad is not a spring chicken any more. If anyone says, &#39;Go buy a postage stamp in London,&#39; I&#39;ll go and do it.</p><p>I had to learn to dance for &#39;The Adjustment Bureau&#39; and it was nearly impossible. I turned up with my knees knocking in my leotard and went home and cried my eyes out.</p><p>I hate formal stuff. I love looking like a doll and all that stuff and playing dress up, but when I&#39;m home, sweat pants, t-shirt. When I&#39;m in the studio, sweat pants, t-shirt.</p><p>The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world, about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home? How can I pay for a new car? Are immigrants taking away my white world?</p><p>I buy records - vinyl. I have a record player at home.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges in my job is letting go of the movie once you go home at night, and knowing you can&#39;t do anything to your performance once you&#39;ve laid it on film.</p><p>There are no college courses to build up self-esteem or high school or elementary school. If you don&#39;t get those values at a early age, nurtured in your home, you don&#39;t get them.</p><p>I love being on stage if I&#39;m not on a set. If I&#39;m at home, I&#39;m usually in my office editing or reconstructing my website or whatever it may be. I just love putting creativity into a performance, so if the right script comes along, and I certainly am reading comedies and dramas now, then I&#39;m ready willing and able to give it a shot.</p><p>I do portraits. I usually do live models in a class environment, but I&#39;ve been painting at home more. I really love the human form, and I love faces. I&#39;ve tried to do landscapes a few times.</p><p>I&#39;ve gone very far, far away, but my character keeps me close to home.</p><p>During the periods in my marriage when I chose to stay home with my kids rather than work as an attorney, it caused me no end of anxiety. Despite the fact that I knew I was contributing to our family by caring for our children, I still felt that my worth was less because I wasn&#39;t earning.</p><p>Why go for a costly, sickly, mass-produced purebred when shelters are full of one-of-a-kind mixed breeds who are literally dying for a home?</p><p>I am a particular fan of integrative exercise - that is, exercise that occurs in the course of doing some productive activity such as gardening, bicycling to work, doing home improvement projects and so on.</p><p>A beautiful bouquet or a long-lasting flowering plant is a traditional gift for women, but I have recommended that both men and women keep fresh flowers in the home for their beauty, fragrance, and the lift they give our spirits.</p><p>Part of the reason I sort of shot out like a cannon out of Michigan and left home at such an early age is because I had to feel independent.</p><p>I know this sounds generic, but I&#39;m so happy to be home with my husband, my family, and my dog.</p><p>Turn up the lights. I don&#39;t want to go home in the dark.</p><p>Divorce is one of the key predictors of poverty for a child growing up in a home that&#39;s broken.</p><p>I support workplace clean air. But a federal ban on smoking would mean that you couldn&#39;t smoke in your own home. I don&#39;t care what people do in their home.</p><p>It&#39;s like, if you can&#39;t focus on a movie for 90 minutes without looking at your phone, then don&#39;t go to the movies! You&#39;ve got some issues, so you should probably stay home and work on those issues, and not distract everyone with lights, and sounds, oh my gosh, the tapping on the screens, it makes me crazy!</p><p>I&#39;m a better person in a relationship, and I&#39;m a happier person. I need to come home at the end of the day and have it not be about me and my freaking hair and makeup and character motivations anymore. And I think my work is more inspired when home is safe and sound and solid, because what I do for a living is so bananas and so insecure.</p><p>I will end up with someone in the arts. I am positive. I eat, breathe and sleep acting. And I&#39;ll end up with someone who is happy staying at home and having me cook supper. But I also really need to be intellectually challenged and stimulated. I want someone bookish, and someone who is passionate.</p><p>After spending time with the rescued turkeys at Farm Sanctuary&#39;s shelter and seeing how similar they are to my furry companion animals at home, I knew I needed to do everything in my power to protect these friendly and curious birds from the daily pain and suffering they endure on factory farms.</p><p>When you have the paparazzi hiding in the bushes outside your home, the only thing you can control is how you respond publicly.</p><p>When I joined Custer I donned the uniform of a soldier. It was a bit awkward at first but I soon got to be perfectly at home in men&#39;s clothes.</p><p>My divorce came to me as a complete surprise. That&#39;s what happens when you haven&#39;t been home in eighteen years.</p><p>You know, you go home and you try on a new mascara, and I guess a male CEO can&#39;t do that.</p><p>We talk a lot in our home together about where we&#39;re going, what I&#39;m doing.</p><p>At home I&#39;ve got a very puerile, juvenile sense of humour.</p><p>To the former child migrants, who came to Australia from a home far away, led to believe this land would be a new beginning, when only to find it was not a beginning, but an end, an end of innocence - we apologise and we are sorry. To the mothers who lost the maternal right to love and care for their child - we apologise, and we are sorry.</p><p>My father was always depressed. When he was home and sober, he was mostly in his room.</p><p>I think it&#39;s easiest to teach by example. My dad didn&#39;t tell us to work hard we just saw how hard he worked. I know I have shortcomings - like a short fuse - but I&#39;ve learned you can&#39;t come home from a long day of work and snap at the kids.</p><p>Imagine if you had baseball cards that showed all the performance stats for your people: batting averages, home runs, errors, ERAs, win/loss records. You could see what they did well and poorly and call on the right people to play the right positions in a very transparent way.</p><p>Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning.</p><p>We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.</p><p>None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.</p><p>My great hope is to laugh as much as I cry to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return.</p><p>I find hope in the darkest of days, and focus in the brightest. I do not judge the universe.</p><p>I hope to stand firm enough to not go backward, and yet not go forward fast enough to wreck the country&#39;s cause.</p><p>A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success.</p><p>Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man.</p><p>Lord save us all from a hope tree that has lost the faculty of putting out blossoms.</p><p>Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul - and sings the tunes without the words - and never stops at all.</p><p>This suspense is terrible. I hope it will last.</p><p>Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.</p><p>Be careful to leave your sons well instructed rather than rich, for the hopes of the instructed are better than the wealth of the ignorant.</p><p>He that lives upon hope will die fasting.</p><p>Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.</p><p>You may not always have a comfortable life and you will not always be able to solve all of the world&#39;s problems at once but don&#39;t ever underestimate the importance you can have because history has shown us that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own.</p><p>Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.</p><p>Hope is the dream of a waking man.</p><p>We must free ourselves of the hope that the sea will ever rest. We must learn to sail in high winds.</p><p>In the end, that&#39;s what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope?</p><p>Tomorrow hopes we have learned something from yesterday.</p><p>Courage is like love it must have hope for nourishment.</p><p>Hope is tomorrow&#39;s veneer over today&#39;s disappointment.</p><p>Never deprive someone of hope it might be all they have.</p><p>Everything that is done in the world is done by hope.</p><p>Hope springs eternal in the human breast: Man never is, but always To be Blest.</p><p>God grant me the courage not to give up what I think is right even though I think it is hopeless.</p><p>I simply can&#39;t build my hopes on a foundation of confusion, misery and death... I think... peace and tranquillity will return again.</p><p>In this world you&#39;ve just got to hope for the best and prepare for the worst and take whatever God sends.</p><p>Chance has never yet satisfied the hope of a suffering people.</p><p>A strong mind always hopes, and has always cause to hope.</p><p>We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon.</p><p>When we have lost everything, including hope, life becomes a disgrace, and death a duty.</p><p>I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope, For hope would be hope for the wrong thing.</p><p>Where there is no vision, there is no hope.</p><p>A whole stack of memories never equal one little hope.</p><p>Expecting something for nothing is the most popular form of hope.</p><p>At the end of the day, we must go forward with hope and not backward by fear and division.</p><p>Every day begins with an act of courage and hope: getting out of bed.</p><p>Hope is the last thing a person does before they are defeated.</p><p>Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper.</p><p>Hope is the only universal liar who never loses his reputation for veracity.</p><p>My hope still is to leave the world a bit better than when I got here.</p><p>Hopeful thinking can get you out of your fear zone and into your appreciation zone.</p><p>To live without Hope is to Cease to live.</p><p>Beware how you take away hope from another human being.</p><p>Don&#39;t give up. Don&#39;t lose hope. Don&#39;t sell out.</p><p>It is only hope which is real, and reality is a bitterness and a deceit.</p><p>I hope that I may always desire more than I can accomplish.</p><p>Hope is like the sun, which, as we journey toward it, casts the shadow of our burden behind us.</p><p>The trouble with most people is that they think with their hopes or fears or wishes rather than with their minds.</p><p>Hope is like peace. It is not a gift from God. It is a gift only we can give one another.</p><p>Things start out as hopes and end up as habits.</p><p>The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives and the dreams shall never die.</p><p>Hope will never be silent.</p><p>I place no hope in my strength, nor in my works: but all my confidence is in God my protector, who never abandons those who have put all their hope and thought in him.</p><p>I have tried to keep on with my striving because this is the only hope I have of ever achieving anything worthwhile and lasting.</p><p>Uncertainty is the refuge of hope.</p><p>It&#39;s time to get real, folks. Hope and change ain&#39;t working. Hope and change is not a solution. Hope and change is not a job.</p><p>One lives in the hope of becoming a memory.</p><p>All human wisdom is summed up in two words wait and hope.</p><p>The world is bad but not without hope.

Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.</p><p>Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable - a most sacred right - a right, which we hope and believe, is to liberate the world.</p><p>All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.</p><p>Imagine all the people living life in peace. You may say I&#39;m a dreamer, but I&#39;m not the only one. I hope someday you&#39;ll join us, and the world will be as one.</p><p>If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.</p><p>I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial by strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country.</p><p>All the great things are simple, and many can be expressed in a single word: freedom, justice, honor, duty, mercy, hope.</p><p>Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope.</p><p>The hope of a secure and livable world lies with disciplined nonconformists who are dedicated to justice, peace and brotherhood.</p><p>My dream is of a place and a time where America will once again be seen as the last best hope of earth.</p><p>A very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love.</p><p>I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best.</p><p>Israel was not created in order to disappear - Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom.</p><p>Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.</p><p>Few things in the world are more powerful than a positive push. A smile. A world of optimism and hope. A &#39;you can do it&#39; when things are tough.</p><p>In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free - honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.</p><p>Action and reaction, ebb and flow, trial and error, change - this is the rhythm of living. Out of our over-confidence, fear out of our fear, clearer vision, fresh hope. And out of hope, progress.</p><p>Come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.</p><p>If you die you&#39;re completely happy and your soul somewhere lives on. I&#39;m not afraid of dying. Total peace after death, becoming someone else is the best hope I&#39;ve got.</p><p>To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable.

Martin Luther King Jr. was alive, Malcolm X was alive great, great leaders were emerging from the southern freedom movement.</p><p>The contrasts between what is spent today to educate a child in the poorest New York City neighborhoods, where teacher salaries are often even lower than the city averages, and spending levels in the wealthiest suburban areas are daunting challenges to any hope New Yorkers might retain that even semblances of fairness still prevail.</p><p>If we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true, there would be little hope of advance.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to hope anymore. I don&#39;t think we should hope anymore. We hoped enough. Now we have to do. We all have to do now.</p><p>The poor prey on one another because their lives offer no hope and communicate the tragic message to these human beings that they have no possibility to attain a decent standard of living.</p><p>I never make a movie for awards consideration. I will use the hope of getting an Academy Award a) to honor the people who work so hard and also b) it&#39;s the greatest Good Housekeeping seal in the world. It&#39;s the greatest brand. It&#39;s as good as Louis Vuitton and Dior in the world of moviemaking. It&#39;s the Super Bowl.</p><p>I hope to continue my friendship with France and its filmmakers for many years to come.</p><p>I would hope that understanding and reconciliation are not limited to the 19th hole alone.</p><p>The great hope of society is in individual character.</p><p>I kind of call myself an atheist, I suppose - although quite a spiritual atheist, I hope.</p><p>In between films I like to travel and hope to visit every continent before I become a mother.</p><p>I hope I left behind a legacy that people will enjoy. But whatever they want to say, I can&#39;t predict.</p><p>Bottom up thinkers try to start from experience and move from experience to understanding. They don&#39;t start with certain general principles they think beforehand are likely to be true they just hope to find out what reality is like.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how many good books I still have in me I hope there are another four or five.</p><p>I hope I never get so hard up I have to do advertisements. I&#39;ve gotten ridiculous offers.</p><p>To my utter despair I have discovered, and discover every day anew, that there is in the masses no revolutionary idea or hope or passion.</p><p>It has never been, and never will be easy work! But the road that is built in hope is more pleasant to the traveler than the road built in despair, even though they both lead to the same destination.</p><p>You never know what movie I will be in next, but let&#39;s just hope it&#39;s sells (for my sake at least)!</p><p>What can you do if a part of it is uphill? You can&#39;t work out another route. You&#39;ve just got to run the one they give you. But they tell me London is a nice course. Even the cobbles, I hope, are not very much of a problem for me.</p><p>Nothing you write, if you hope to be good, will ever come out as you first hoped.</p><p>We will have to give up the hope that, if we try hard, we somehow will always do right by our children. The connection is imperfect. We will sometimes do wrong.</p><p>There is no hope even that woman, with her right to vote, will ever purify politics.</p><p>I think by now I have made it fairly clear that I am not very happy with the word hope. I don&#39;t believe in people just hoping.</p><p>My opinion is the greatest reward that any government could get is the approval of the people. If the people are happy and the people are at peace and the government has done something for them, that&#39;s the greatest reward I think any government could hope for.</p><p>To communicate the truths of history is an act of hope for the future.</p><p>There are a lot of movies I&#39;d like to throw away. That&#39;s not to say that I went in with that attitude. Any film I ever started, I went in with all the hope and best intentions in the world, but some films just don&#39;t work.</p><p>The other day I got a text from a boy, but it wasn&#39;t hot. I mean, if you&#39;re going to text me every day, you haven&#39;t seen me for months and you&#39;re trying to seduce me, you&#39;d better spice up that text and make it more exciting than &#39;How was your day? I hope you&#39;re having a beautiful one.&#39; Sadly, I haven&#39;t been doing a lot of kissing lately.</p><p>I hope that through my example, such as my role on &#39;The West Wing,&#39; I can help change attitudes on deafness and prove we can really do everything... except hear.</p><p>I hope I&#39;m not a tourist attraction - I&#39;m sure that they come here really because St. Andrews is just amazing, a beautiful place.</p><p>I have learned from my experiences in this industry that there is absolutely no way to control people&#39;s opinions on your performance in your movie. You go out there, promote your film and hope people like the work you did.</p><p>I love Bono. I really respect what he has done for Africa and how he has used his fame to do good in the world. I hope I can do half as much in my life.</p><p>Over the past few years, the road to confrontation has shown its consequences: loss of innocent lives, destruction and fear. Most costly, however, was the loss of hope. The most precious gift that you can present to your peoples over the coming weeks is renewed hope born out of tangible progress on the ground.</p><p>Is Israel going to continue to be &#39;Fortress Israel&#39;? Or, as we all hope, become accepted into the neighborhood, which I believe is the only way we can move forward in harmony.</p><p>I hope that none of the countries in the Middle East are planning anything but the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy.</p><p>At the end of the day we want to bring stability and hope to Iraq. That&#39;s the only way to defeat terrorism.</p><p>We have to always hope in humanity that people will make the right choices.</p><p>You have to trust your kids. They have to experience life, and you just hope you&#39;ve provided them a foundation for what&#39;s right and what isn&#39;t.</p><p>I am not afraid of dying. I have lived longer than most people in the world. What scares me is to have a body that works but a brain that is waving goodbye. If that happens, I hope I die quickly.</p><p>In the kind of world we have today, transformation of humanity might well be our only real hope for survival.</p><p>Looking after my health today gives me a better hope for tomorrow.</p><p>I hope by the time I&#39;m 30 to have a husband and maybe a baby.</p><p>They who do not understand that a man may be brought to hope that which of all things is the most grievous to him, have not observed with sufficient closeness the perversity of the human mind.</p><p>In both children and adults, there can be a hard-to-deny link between a robust sense of hope and either work productivity or academic achievement.</p><p>It&#39;s far too much to say that effective hoping is the only - or even the biggest - part of what it takes to succeed. If 14% of business productivity can be attributed to hope, that means 86% is dependent on raw talent, fickle business cycles, the quality of the product you&#39;re selling, and often pure, dumb luck.</p><p>It seems to me there is a change in what audiences want to see. I can only hope that&#39;s correct, because there&#39;s an awful lot of people of my age around now and we outnumber the others.</p><p>Today is a celebration of hope for the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people can now take control of their government and their future by creating a society that protects the rights endowed to us by our creator - life, liberty and freedom.</p><p>Yes, I&#39;ve listened to just a few audiobooks - but hope to listen to more. I&#39;ve wanted to investigate how my own books sound in this format and find the experience of listening, and not reading, quite fascinating.</p><p>I have more awareness of other people and, I hope, more sensitivity to their needs. I also find that I&#39;m more direct and outspoken.</p><p>I do sometimes strongly hope that in a past life, my most recent life before this, I was absolutely horrible, evil, hideous. Because otherwise - well, hell, to even things up next time around, I&#39;m going to have to pay for this one, am I not?</p><p>I have always striven to raise the voice of hope for a world where hate gives way to respect and oppression to liberation.</p><p>One of the principal goals in my life has been to avoid embarrassing my children by doing the job I do. I hope I&#39;ve managed to do that, and I hope that, with the job I&#39;m in now, they are, if not proud, at least unembarrassed by it. I must say, my three are most agreeable children, who do nothing but delight me.</p><p>Hope is a necessity for normal life and the major weapon against the suicide impulse.</p><p>I hope the Guggenheim plan will be revived.</p><p>My hope and prayer is that the body of Christ in America will awake with holy boldness, a boldness content neither with silence nor mere words but that backs up those words with action and results.</p><p>I suppose if I&#39;d got a brilliant first and done research I might still be a don today, but I hope not. People become dons because they are incapable of doing anything else in life.</p><p>I hope to one day co-sign a lease with another person but, well, it doesn&#39;t plague me that I have yet to do so. Put it this way: I&#39;ve never had to violently tug at my own pillow at 2 A.M. to get myself to stop snoring.</p><p>I love being able to sing for my job. I am blessed beyond words and I hope my fans can feel that while I&#39;m on stage!</p><p>I really feel confident about my dancing now, so I hope there could be a place for me in the West End or on Broadway - maybe a musical, maybe my own show.</p><p>Overcoming the Cold War required courage from the people of Central and Eastern Europe and what was then the German Democratic Republic, but it also required the steadfastness of Western partner over many decades when many had long lost hope of integration of the two Germanys and Europe.</p><p>It was an amazing adventure, it was my dream to be in an American musical... I really hope you are going to love what you are going to see.</p><p>I never read the life of any important person without discovering that he knew more and could do more than I could ever hope to know or do in half a dozen lifetimes.</p><p>We need to have a pro-growth policy put in place that offers people hope and offers the opportunity for businesses to expand and for them to have confidence in what the world is going to look like for the next two or three or four years with respect to economic policy.</p><p>I am proud to have been capable of giving people hope again.</p><p>I know where I&#39;m going and I have told the French. I am sure if hope is there, we will be able to put France back on its feet... to live better in five years than we do today.</p><p>There are hurdles, there are handicaps, hardships you have to face in life, but you hope for a great future.</p><p>It&#39;s always been my hope, as an actor, to reveal only what is relevant about myself to the work.</p><p>If you&#39;re lucky enough to be involved in a film that&#39;s about something very real and that you hope will continue to hold up in 20 years&#39; time it just gives you more energy and makes it feel all the more worthwhile.</p><p>Politics is not predictions and politics is not observations. Politics is what we do. Politics is what we do, politics is what we create, by what we work for, by what we hope for and what we dare to imagine.</p><p>I hope I&#39;m still shooting when I&#39;m 80.</p><p>The history of our country is cruel. We have to face those issues or, should I say, we had to. Not anymore I hope, because we are going in the right direction, and we are ready to forgive, ready to move on.</p><p>Most American fascists are enthusiastically supporting the war effort. They are doing this even in those cases where they hope to have profitable connections with German chemical firms after the war ends.</p><p>I think almost every writer in the world would hope that books would be always talked about with respect and civility and depth and seriousness.</p><p>A man can stand a lot as long as he can stand himself. He can live without hope, without friends, without books, even without music, as long as he can listen to his own thoughts.</p><p>I&#39;m constantly thinking about what I&#39;ll do next. I never count on music being a career of longevity. I mean, longevity is key, and I hope that it lasts, but you just don&#39;t know, because it&#39;s not in your hands, you don&#39;t make the decision.</p><p>Jim Thorpe is someone I&#39;ve always loved. He was an Olympic athlete, you know, and a football player from back in the day. I&#39;d love to play him. And then there&#39;s a guy called Iceman who was a top hit man for the mob. I would love to play him. Actually, it&#39;s sort of in the works, so I hope it goes through.</p><p>&#39;A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints&#39; was the first real actor-actor part I did, and I hope I to do more. Action movies are fun, but I&#39;d be happy not to do them if there are better roles.</p><p>I think the way IBM has embraced the open source philosophy has been quite astonishing, but gratifying. I hope they&#39;ll do very well with it.</p><p>Hope is such a bait, it covers any hook.</p><p>As a relatively young woman - I&#39;m 33 - I hope to one day have a family and already have commitments. If and when I&#39;m elected as an MP, I would face a choice: take my family with me to London each week or be apart for four, maybe five, nights a week.</p><p>I just hope that the democratic will of the Zimbabwean people prevails. If it does we must move quickly to help restore stability and prosperity.</p><p>Hope is like a harebell trembling from its birth.</p><p>She gave up beauty in her tender youth, gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways she covered up her eyes lest they should gaze on vanity, and chose the bitter truth.</p><p>I prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else. I&#39;m more worried about being a good person than being the best football player in the world. When all this is over, what are you left with? When I retire, I hope I am remembered for being a decent guy.</p><p>I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam.</p><p>When you are kind to someone in trouble, you hope they&#39;ll remember and be kind to someone else. And it&#39;ll become like a wildfire.</p><p>What I hope is in five years&#39; time, I can go to the British people in the election and say: Lots of you doubted that coalition politics worked, but it has worked.</p><p>I don&#39;t know now if I&#39;m funny. I just keep talking and hope that I hit something that&#39;s funny.</p><p>I hope what I do has an art to it, and as an artist you have to try new things and keep yourself entertained.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to say never, but I hope I don&#39;t become that &#39;take me seriously now&#39; guy.</p><p>My fear is that, as soon as I get married and have kids that I&#39;ll kind of do what a lot of people do and suddenly start making, &#39;Now I&#39;m gonna make films for kids.&#39; I really hope I don&#39;t do that.</p><p>I hope we never get to the point that we put ourselves in Jesus&#39; place. But when I read the New Testament basically, we get three mandates: to love God, to love each other, and to take care of the least among us. And I think this is at least a step in the right direction.</p><p>For many in baseball September is a month of stark contrast with April, when everyone had dared to hope. If baseball is a lot like life, as pundits declare, it is because life is more about losing than winning.</p><p>Television has spread the habit of instant reaction and stimulated the hope of instant results.</p><p>One of the things I like best about &#39;Biggest Loser&#39; is being around people who are trying to make the right choices. When you feel defeated about your weight and your health, like there&#39;s no hope, and you still make the choice to fight for it, to make the change happen no matter what people say or think, that&#39;s inspiring to me.</p><p>You have to have hope. It&#39;s irresponsible to give false hope, which I think a lot of playwrights are guilty of. But I also think it&#39;s irresponsible to simply be a nihilist, which quite a lot of playwrights, especially playwrights younger than me, have become guilty of.</p><p>If you know that life is basically going to be horrendously difficult, at best, and all but unlivable at worst, or possibly even unlivable, do you go on? And the choice to go on is the only thing that I think can be called hope. Because if hope isn&#39;t forced to encounter the worst possibility, then it&#39;s a lie.</p><p>As I travel across the country speaking about MS, perhaps I can offer others comfort and hope.</p><p>I think we have lost our groove as a country. One of the reasons was the attack on 9/11. We got knocked off our game. From a country that always exported hope we went into the business of exporting fear.</p><p>People see I am a mother and head of a household. Today in Chile, one-third of households are run by women. They wake up, take the children to school, go to work. To them I am hope.</p><p>Hope is a very unruly emotion.</p><p>I hope for peace and sanity - it&#39;s the same thing.</p><p>I think it&#39;s realistic to have hope. One can be a perverse idealist and say the easiest thing: &#39;I despair. The world&#39;s no good.&#39; That&#39;s a perverse idealist. It&#39;s practical to hope, because the hope is for us to survive as a human species. That&#39;s very realistic.</p><p>We use the word &#39;hope&#39; perhaps more often than any other word in the vocabulary: &#39;I hope it&#39;s a nice day.&#39; &#39;Hopefully, you&#39;re doing well.&#39; &#39;So how are things going along? Pretty good. Going to be good tomorrow? Hope so.&quot;</p><p>I hope to be around past the 90&#39;s. I don&#39;t want to just be categorized as one of this era. My goal is to have a career that stands.</p><p>We hope President Obama will now respect the will of the people, change course, and commit to making the changes they are demanding. To the extent he is willing to do this, we are ready to work with him.</p><p>House and Senate Republicans are now united in adopting earmark bans. We hope President Obama will follow through on his support for an earmark ban by pressing Democratic leaders to join House and Senate Republicans in taking this critical step to restore public trust.</p><p>If there is to be any hope of prosperity for this country it is by reversing that policy which made us simply the kitchen garden for supplying the British with cheap food.</p><p>I love the Beatles. I haven&#39;t named any kids after them but I still really love them. They were the first group that I was ever properly aware of. In my early teens I would sometimes stay in and listen to the radio all day in the hope that I would catch a song by them that I&#39;d never heard before and be able to tape it on my radio-cassette player.</p><p>I am proud, and more than a little excited, to be asked to work with Faber in an editorial capacity. It is my dearest hope that we will produce some fantastic books together.</p><p>For myself, if I am to stake all I have and hope to be upon anything, I will venture it upon the abounding fullness of God - upon the assurance that, as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are His ways higher than our ways, and His thoughts than our thoughts.</p><p>I hope to have one more boxing match at the age of 55. Given that demographic at the age of 55 to 65, you&#39;ve got to make a statement with your life. Otherwise, you are just existing.</p><p>I&#39;m really happy here. I think anyone who knows me well, and the fans too I hope, they know that I love the area, and the bond that I&#39;ve had with the fans has been fantastic.</p><p>I hope to make movies that are so small they don&#39;t need to make anything to be profitable.</p><p>Flying back from New York, the flight attendant said &#39;God, I wished you were here yesterday, we had a stroke on the plane. I said, if I have a stroke on a plane, I hope the pretend doctor isn&#39;t the one on the plane. I want a real doctor.</p><p>I think films have to reach people and really grab them. That&#39;s what I hope to do when I make a film - to get under your skin and really make you think about something, and have a transporting time that takes you somewhere.</p><p>Journalists say a thing that they know isn&#39;t true, in the hope that if they keep on saying it long enough it will be true.</p><p>There was a moment in my life when I really wanted to kill myself. And there was one other moment when I was close to that. But even in my most jaded times, I had some hope.</p><p>So we just hope that all of these governors who are grappling will be able to provide the basic services to our citizens and not have to cut things that really are painful.</p><p>There&#39;s hope for everyone. That&#39;s what makes the world go round.</p><p>I think sometimes all you need is to hear someone else say the same thing that you&#39;re going through to realize that you&#39;re not alone. I try to put some sense of hope into the songs, into whatever the situation is so that it&#39;s not just dirt, drudgery and a life of misery.</p><p>I hope to be an actor and never retire.</p><p>Everybody, sooner or later, will have to go under the knife. Let&#39;s hope they make out as well as I did.</p><p>My book &#39;Trust Your Heart&#39;, which is the story of my life, will be followed by &#39;Singing Lessons&#39;, a memoir of love, loss, hope, and healing, which talks about the death of my son and the hope that has been the aftermath of the healing from that tragedy.</p><p>The moment that changed me for ever was the moment my first child was born. I was happy, filled with hope, and thought, &#39;Now I understand the whole point of work, of life, of love.&#39;</p><p>Now science has presented us with a hope called stem cell research, which may provide our scientists with many answers that have for so long been beyond our grasp.</p><p>You cannot set art off in a corner and hope for it to have vitality, reality, and substance.</p><p>But what I hope for from a book - either one that I write or one that I read - is transparency. I want the story to shine through. I don&#39;t want to think of the writer.</p><p>I hope to stay unemployed as a war photographer till the end of my life.</p><p>There is no word for feeling nostalgic about the future, but that&#39;s what a parent&#39;s tears often are, a nostalgia for something that has not yet occurred. They are the pain of hope, the helplessness of hope, and finally, the surrender to hope.</p><p>People tend to overstate my resilience, but, of course, I hope they&#39;re right.</p><p>I do insist on making what I hope is sense so there&#39;s always a coherent narrative or argument that the reader can follow.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe that I&#39;m better than anybody, but I do believe that I&#39;ll try harder than most and I hope that people just join me for a little bit of a ride.</p><p>When I am dead, I hope it may be said: His sins were scarlet, but his books were read.</p><p>Music is something that always lifts my spirits and makes me happy, and when I make music I always hope it will have the same effect on whoever listens to it.</p><p>Few people know so clearly what they want. Most people can&#39;t even think what to hope for when they throw a penny in a fountain.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter that the way of life shown by Hollywood was phony. It helped you hope.</p><p>Ironically, Latin American countries, in their instability, give writers and intellectuals the hope that they are needed.</p><p>I hope I can help guys come out and say, &#39;All right, dude, I got a manicure... and I liked it.&#39;</p><p>I think it&#39;s impossible to judge whether another person should come out. You just hope they will on their own time and their own terms.</p><p>If we are going to stay a great power and I hope and pray we will we need the truth. We need to know what is going right and we need to know what is going wrong. There is no greater time than now.</p><p>It&#39;s part of the calling to at least do a few songs in the show that give people some hope. There&#39;s so much hurt in this world and... music is such a great healing balm and a great way to forget your troubles.</p><p>I told the President, I told Rahm Emanuel and others in the administration that I thought the policy they took to try to bring about negotiations is counter-productive, because when you give the Palestinians hope that the United States will do its negotiating for them, they are not going to sit down and talk.</p><p>It would be fun to do a reunion show. I hope we do it some day, but it better be soon. We&#39;re all getting on.</p><p>If one seeks to analyze experiences and reactions to the first postwar years, I hope one may say without being accused of bias that it is easier for the victor than for the vanquished to advocate peace.</p><p>TV is so different from the movies. It takes a lot of stamina because you work such long hours. It is really challenging. You are learning the next day&#39;s lines while you are shooting today&#39;s scenes. I found courage I never realised I had. I hope to do more.</p><p>The only thing I hope I did was never put in question my love for the game, or my passion to be counted on when it mattered most.</p><p>I hope this doesn&#39;t sound pompous but I don&#39;t think of myself as famous, whatever fame I&#39;ve got has come through what I&#39;ve done and associations of things I&#39;ve done.</p><p>When we cannot hope to win, it is an advantage to yield.</p><p>No matter how dark things may get in a story, I feel it&#39;s the responsibility of the storyteller to leave the audience with at least a shred of hope.</p><p>We must vote for hope, vote for life, vote for a brighter future for all of our loved ones.</p><p>The Opera was a very cold film, a hopeless and dark film, no hope, no love.</p><p>At the end of the day, my hope is that when the new Medicare- Prescription Drug Law gets up and fully running a lot more seniors will pay a whole lot less than they do today for their much-needed medications.</p><p>Having kids is something I want to see in my future - I hope.</p><p>I don&#39;t care what other critics say, I only hope to be played.</p><p>We all hope for breakthrough rebirth moments.</p><p>I&#39;m a vegetarian and very much active in regards to how I feel about animal rights and protecting animals and giving animals a voice. But at the same time, I appreciate and respect other people&#39;s decisions to eat meat. The only thing that I hope is that people are educated, that they&#39;re aware, that they&#39;re living a conscious lifestyle.</p><p>I hope SeaWorld is exploring how, like Ringling, it can get out of the wild animal business.</p><p>By presenting a faithful and honest record of my experience as a mother, I hope to show both my readers and my children how truth can redeem even what you fear might be the gravest of sins.</p><p>To not be self-conscious of your appearance is huge, and something that I desperately hope to carry into film at some point in my useless life - to not be thinking, &#39;My ear looks weird from this angle, why is the camera over there?&#39;</p><p>You know, in my hometown of Hope, Arkansas, the three sacred heroes were Jesus, Elvis, and FDR, not necessarily in that order.</p><p>It&#39;s true that General Musharraf opposes my return, seeing me as a symbol of democracy in the country. He is comfortable with dictatorship. I hope better sense prevails.</p><p>If newspapers were a baseball team, they would be the Mets - without the hope for those folks at the very pinnacle of the financial food chain - who average nearly $24 million a year in income - &#39;next year.&#39;</p><p>The myth of the liberal media empowers conservatives to control debate in the United States to the point where liberals cannot even hope for a fair shake anymore.</p><p>I gather from a lawyer that there was a rehearsal yesterday. We haven&#39;t a hope. I know the presiding judge too: I&#39;ve had the misfortune to sleep with his wife. He was specially picked.</p><p>I have taken this step because I want the discipline, the fire and the authority of the Church. I am hopelessly unworthy of it, but I hope to become worthy.</p><p>Well, I&#39;ve been reading a lot about the fifty years since the Second World War, about Western foreign policy and all that. I try not to let it get to me, but sometimes I just think that there&#39;s no hope.</p><p>Like all parents, my husband and I just do the best we can, hold our breath and hope we&#39;ve set aside enough money for our kid&#39;s therapy.</p><p>Like when I host a party. I hope my guests get along. But if not, how interesting!</p><p>Hope is a flatterer, but the most upright of all parasites for she frequents the poor man&#39;s hut, as well as the palace of his superior.</p><p>What you hope for, like Unforgiven did a lot to give you a chance to do it again sometime.</p><p>I hope we will not so characterize religious people as being so narrow and so biased towards people not of their own religion that they cannot even work with them in this common cause to which you say they are committed.</p><p>Hope is a risk that must be run.</p><p>I&#39;m moving on. I should have made that clear when I made the announcement. I guess I wasn&#39;t clear. If people think you&#39;re leaving a show after all these years, you might be retiring. So I understand where they&#39;re coming from, but I should have impressed the fact that I hope I&#39;m just moving on right now.</p><p>I try and reduce myself to an almost blank slate and hope to God that I am creative.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel despair because I am able to make the films I want to make, and that gives me hope.</p><p>I would hope everyone would be a feminist.</p><p>I hope to keep entertaining in some way until I can&#39;t physically entertain any longer. It&#39;s what I was born to do, and I love this profession.</p><p>Jake Roberts has a hard enough time being Jake Roberts. The truth is a brutal thing, I just hope that the kids take the time to learn about each of the wrestlers in the game, and if the kids can learn from our mistakes, that would make me a happy man.</p><p>You can always get the truth from an American statesman after he has turned seventy, or given up all hope of the Presidency.</p><p>In fact, it works the other way: A government as big and bossy as this one is maintained on the backs of the middle class and those who hope to join it.</p><p>White actors still get way more money in Hollywood. It&#39;s been that way for a very long time. I hope it&#39;ll change, but it&#39;s a matter of forcing that change.</p><p>I hope girls read what I say in interviews - they should just be themselves.</p><p>Reconciliation should be accompanied by justice, otherwise it will not last. While we all hope for peace it shouldn&#39;t be peace at any cost but peace based on principle, on justice.</p><p>It is above all by the imagination that we achieve perception and compassion and hope.</p><p>Inventions have long since reached their limit, and I see no hope for further development.</p><p>Certain it is that a great responsibility rests upon the statesmen of all nations, not only to fulfill the promises for reduction in armaments, but to maintain the confidence of the people of the world in the hope of an enduring peace.</p><p>You hope people are going to be listening to you after you&#39;re gone. And they like you better after you&#39;re gone.</p><p>As a young actor, people were trying to define who I was before I really knew that for myself. But I still remember thinking, &#39;This is what I love doing, and I hope I&#39;m going to be able to do it forever.&#39;</p><p>Pope John Paul II brought hope to all corners of the world, to people of all faiths and backgrounds, with his powerful belief in the human spirit.</p><p>Being an artist is a very long game. It is not a 10-year game. I hope I&#39;ll be around making art when I&#39;m 80.</p><p>I hope to make a positive, productive contribution, as cheesy as that may sound.</p><p>Little Miss Sunshine&#39; snowballed. It was a tiny movie. We shot it in 30 days, and it was really fun to do, but it was one of those small movies that you don&#39;t hold out huge hope for.;Greg Kinnear;hope 36686;The London games mark the 24th anniversary of my winning two golds and setting the world record in the heptathlon. Someone is going to want it records are made to be broken - it&#39;s only a matter of time. I hope mine will outlive me.;Jackie Joyner-Kersee;hope 36687;My denial and irresponsible attitude about asthma put me at great risk and caused me so much needless suffering. My hope is that the kids I talk to learn to open up about their asthma, become educated about their condition, and seek help.;Jackie Joyner-Kersee;hope 36688;The 2012 London Olympic Games fostered a generation of hope. I witnessed women participating for the very first time, representing every nation.;Jackie Joyner-Kersee;hope 36689;I remember thinking, That&#39;s what I need - and that hope was in Jesus Christ.;Willie Aames;hope 36690;You promised to take care of me and not to turn your back on me. How is it possible that you never wrote to me even once and you never came back to see me? Do you think that it is fun for me to spend months, even years, without any news, without any hope!;Camille Claudel;hope 36691;And I hope America will realise, as the only superpower now, it really must use its power in a way that&#39;s going to build up the world, and to support the United Nations.;George Carey;hope 36692;I hope to get out before they start football next year.;Bear Bryant;hope 36693;Your own experience keeps taking you towards something.

I hope all teachers realize that.</p><p>I&#39;ve had some incredible moments in my life - thus far. I hope a lot more are coming.</p><p>We are all here to be a service to those who can&#39;t be a service to themselves. We can give people hope and more reasons for being human.</p><p>My hope is that countries like Morocco will have investment to create work, so people don&#39;t have to leave.</p><p>Yes, well I really hope I can make a difference, even in the smallest way. I am looking forward to helping as much as I can.</p><p>My daddy, Rev. A. D. King, my granddaddy, Martin Luther King, Senior - we are a family of faith, hope and love.</p><p>We&#39;re reclaiming America and restoring honor. I believe we do that with faith, with hope, with charity, and honoring our brothers and our sisters as we honor each other.</p><p>When I go to a concert, I can&#39;t help but feel happy and everything else just goes away. I hope everyone feels that way at my concerts.</p><p>Sometimes I feel I hope I am not taking advantage of my stardom.</p><p>I love making movies and hope to write my own screenplay someday and do some producing and be behind-the-scenes as well.</p><p>Hope springs eternal, even in politics.</p><p>When I was a kid, my father didn&#39;t really have much hope for me. He thought I was a dreamer he didn&#39;t think I would amount to anything. My mother also.</p><p>I don&#39;t remember deciding to become a writer. You decide to become a dentist or a postman. For me, writing is like being gay. You finally admit that this is who you are, you come out and hope that no one runs away.</p><p>Before I do a play I say that I hope it&#39;s going to be for as short a time as possible but, once you do it, it is a paradoxical pleasure. One evening out of two there are five minutes of a miracle and for those five minutes you want to do it again and again. It&#39;s like a drug.</p><p>I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don&#39;t know... one of my favorite movies is &#39;The Notebook&#39; so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It&#39;s about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.</p><p>I&#39;m thrilled to continue my partnership with U by Kotex for Generation Know while helping to empower girls. I&#39;ve always been a motivational resource for my younger sisters and hope I can positively impact and inspire other young girls too.</p><p>I saw Richard Linklater&#39;s film &#39;Slacker&#39; for my twenty-first birthday. That was the moment when it all seemed possible. This guy gave me hope.</p><p>There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope.</p><p>Flowers are without hope. Because hope is tomorrow and flowers have no tomorrow.</p><p>There&#39;s no hope of me becoming completely relaxed on stage. If I did, I&#39;d sit down and doze off.</p><p>Even if the hopes you started out with are dashed, hope has to be maintained.</p><p>Would it be possible that I should not in any degree succeed? I can scarcely think so. Ah delusive hope, how much further wilt thou lead me?</p><p>I do hope that our spring will be starting shortly and we will all be able to enjoy some sunshine again.</p><p>There are no ideas in the Republican Party right now in the Congress. They&#39;re the party of no. They desperately need some intellectual leadership. And whatever you think of Newt Gingrich, he can supply intellectual leadership. So I hope he does run.</p><p>Families are the tie that reminds us of yesterday, provide strength and support today, and give us hope for tomorrow. No government, no matter how well-intentioned, or well-managed, can provide what our families provide.</p><p>I hope that at the end of the seven years, people will say that I have been of some inspirational value to them at home in terms of inclusiveness and abroad, I look forward to representing Ireland.</p><p>Boast is always a cry of despair, except in the young it is a cry of hope.</p><p>I&#39;m more than open to hope, but I think men and women have a difficult time dealing with each other and often take the low road.</p><p>Fighting a war on terrorism is like fighting against crime. We can never hope to eradicate crime, so we shouldn&#39;t bother fighting it.</p><p>The past is a source of knowledge, and the future is a source of hope. Love of the past implies faith in the future.</p><p>Courage is sometimes frail as hope is frail: a fragile shoot between two stones that grows brave toward the sun though warmth and brightness fail, striving and faith the only strength it knows.</p><p>I hope that it can relate to and be a blessing to anybody, with the hope that someday they will find Jesus Christ to be the same God that I&#39;ve found Him to be.</p><p>I just believe that the feeling of wonder is amazing. I am pushing myself as far as I can humanly push myself... I can only hope for the best and expect the worse.</p><p>I hope I never get so old I get religious.</p><p>We&#39;re in an emergency situation. The United States has become an absolutely terrifying country, and I would hope that I could participate in some way in stopping the horror and the brutality.</p><p>But because we&#39;ve all been readers, we know what the experience is like, and we hope that what certain writers have given to us, we will give to someone.</p><p>I really subscribe to that old adage that you should never let the audience get ahead of you for a second. So if the film&#39;s abrasive and wrongfoots people then, y&#39;know, that&#39;s great. But I hope it involves an audience.</p><p>I hope that just what I sing about and how I relate to my audience is as much of a political statement as I need to make.</p><p>We need international support so that our people live a life of normality, of dignity, of liberty and freedom. I hope that our cry for freedom may be heard.</p><p>Helplessness induces hopelessness, and history attests that loss of hope and not loss of lives is what decides the issue of war.</p><p>Well I certainly have learned and I hope I&#39;m moving on and certainly two years of prison was a terrible punishment.</p><p>You travel with the hope that something unexpected will happen. It has to do with enjoying being lost and figuring it out and the satisfaction. I always get a little disappointed when I know too well where I&#39;m going, or when I&#39;ve lived in a place so long that there&#39;s no chance I could possibly get lost.</p><p>Well, you know, the definition of second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience.</p><p>Yes, I do often write poems from the mind, but I hope I don&#39;t ignore feelings and emotions.</p><p>I hope one day I will host my own charity event to give back to society.</p><p>I am making amends and seeking forgiveness. My only hope is that some good can come out of my situation.</p><p>So foolish is the heart of man that he ever puts his hope in the future, learning nothing from his past errors and fancying that tomorrow must be better than today.</p><p>The comfortable estate of widowhood is the only hope that keeps up a wife&#39;s spirits.</p><p>Whatever I do, I hope it&#39;s quality, I hope it&#39;s something that&#39;s class.</p><p>In live action movies, you just hope that everything works. Because the actor may had a bad morning and doesn&#39;t play good, or accidents happen continuously. Many things contradict what you are trying to say. But in cartoons, nothing contradict what you want to say.</p><p>Even if I went off to some other career, I hope I would still be doing Coen films.</p><p>My great hope would be that Quebec would realize itself fully as a distinct part of Canada, and stay Canadian, bringing to Canada a part of its richness.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to tell your story because you&#39;re a insensitive, self-centered moron. I&#39;ve told a lot of stories about young people, and I always feel there&#39;s hope.</p><p>I would not run for president. I really like what I&#39;m doing now. People say I&#39;m giving them energy and hope.</p><p>Our democracy is the centerpiece of who we are as a nation. And it is the fondest hope of all Americans that we can help bring democracy to every corner of the world.</p><p>That&#39;s the way both they and I travel sometimes. Pick road at random, and when it&#39;s time to pull over, you pull over and hope you can find a place to crash.</p><p>I hope that my government can help change Italian mentality.</p><p>Access to books and the encouragement of the habit of reading: these two things are the first and most necessary steps in education and librarians, teachers and parents all over the country know it. It is our children&#39;s right and it is also our best hope and their best hope for the future.</p><p>I hope I&#39;m in a position to make stuff that I really want to make as opposed to stuff that I just have to make for money reasons, or to sustain a certain marquee value.</p><p>Wherever my story takes me, however dark and difficult the theme, there is always some hope and redemption, not because readers like happy endings, but because I am an optimist at heart. I know the sun will rise in the morning, that there is a light at the end of every tunnel.</p><p>Next year, I hope there will be even more parties, lots of holidays and just having a good time, really. Plus wing-walking, air shows and learning to fly, as they are all things I want to do. I won&#39;t be restricted by age.</p><p>I think if there&#39;s a great depression there might be some hope.</p><p>I&#39;m terrible as I never take my make-up off at night, which I know is really dreadful. Whenever I&#39;m out partying I just can&#39;t be bothered and now I am on &#39;Loose Women&#39; that tends to be all the time. I hope next year holds even more parties for me.</p><p>You learn timing on the road. You learn structure and how to read an audience. You learn so much about the business of laughter that you can&#39;t learn on a set, because it&#39;s all on you. Sometimes you bomb, and you know not to tell that joke again... You just hope people find the humor in the awkwardness.</p><p>I hope to make acting my career for the rest of my life, if I can.</p><p>My greatest desire is that the hope that has overcome fear in my country will help vanquish it around the world.</p><p>I hope that I serve by being a teacher.</p><p>I hope that seeing the excitement of solving this problem will make young mathematicians realize that there are lots and lots of other problems in mathematics which are going to be just as challenging in the future.</p><p>I hope to focus on what I&#39;m passionate about because I think I&#39;d do them best job on them - education, urban education, women and children&#39;s issues and literacy.</p><p>No, I am not a homosexual. If I were a homosexual, I would hope I would have the courage to say so. What&#39;s cruel is that you are forcing me to say I am not a homosexual. This means you are putting homosexuals down. I don&#39;t want to do that.</p><p>I hope to continue writing. I hope to continue teaching.</p><p>I hope we don&#39;t get to the point where we have to have the cat stop chasing the mouse to teach him glassblowing and basket weaving.</p><p>I hope to work with kids any way possible.</p><p>People are rapidly losing hope and trust. They believe their government has been captured by special interests and no longer cares about them, and they are right.</p><p>The way you deal with a scare is the way you deal with a laugh. The timing has to be perfect. When you&#39;re dealing with fear or laughter - emotions that happen spontaneously - you hope it&#39;s working. But in the moment, you really have no idea.</p><p>My object will be, if possible, to form Christian men, for Christian boys I can scarcely hope to make.</p><p>It is in vain to hope to please all alike. Let a man stand with his face in what direction he will, he must necessarily turn his back on one half of the world.</p><p>When they see those fourteen lights, they&#39;re looking at a miracle. And deep down, they feel that whatever&#39;s going to happen, there will be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope.</p><p>If you live through the initial stage of fame and get past it, and remember thats not who you are. If you live past that, then you have a hope of maybe learning how to spell the word artist.</p><p>Being insecure - I&#39;m a master, a virtuoso - they can be handing me the keys to the kingdom and all I can think is, I hope I don&#39;t drop the key.</p><p>We go through the whole season working on next season&#39;s car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff. And we obviously give ideas of what we would hope next year&#39;s car would have even if it&#39;s small things like buttons on the steering wheel and different positions and whatever.</p><p>My hope is that we will turn Greece into maybe the most transparent country in the world with everything on the web.</p><p>We love a good, hyped sound, but when it starts to sound insincere, that&#39;s when I lose interest. I hope that our music, even if it sounds polished, doesn&#39;t sound insincere.</p><p>I am not the same man I was 35 years ago. And I hope that five years and ten years from now, I&#39;ll be a better man, a more mature man, a wiser man, a more humble man and a more spirited man to serve the good of my people and the good of humanity.</p><p>Take hope from the heart of man and you make him a beast of prey.</p><p>I think as a rifle platoon and company commander your view is about 1,000 meters in front of you and you hope you can cover that ground and not have to back up and give it up again.</p><p>You don&#39;t know what someone&#39;s going to walk away from a movie with, but you hope it&#39;s something positive, but if nothing, you want them most basically to be entertained and engaged. That&#39;s your job. But you also hope to give them something to chew on or maybe some insight into the human existence, you hope a little bit. Not to sound too lofty.</p><p>Our only hope is to control the vote.</p><p>We need to recognise that the whole edifice of our fifth estate, of our journalism, has been built on a foundation of newspaper journalism and that that foundation is crumbling. The management of the media companies will deny that the end is nigh. I hope they are right.</p><p>I&#39;ve had nine of my books adapted to film, and almost all were enjoyable. I&#39;ve been very lucky with Hollywood, and look forward to more movies being adapted. But I don&#39;t get involved in that process. I know nothing about making movies and I stay away from it and hope for the best.</p><p>I hope that we can continue this cooperation on other critical issues related to America&#39;s future technological competitiveness. We must work together to encourage the creative talents that have made our country the world leader in technology.</p><p>As the war on terror continues, Americans must honor the brave men and women who gave their lives for the protection of this nation and the hope of peace.</p><p>There is a part of me that still wants to go out and grab a backpack and unplug - not take a cellphone or even a camera and just get out there and experience the world and travel. I have yet to do that, but someday I hope.</p><p>I hope America can also be the cultural leader of the world, and use this frontier spirit to lead and show others that we need courage to go places where we have not gone before.</p><p>I hope that America as a whole, and especially its architects, will become more seriously involved in producing a new architectural culture that would bring the nation to the apex - where it has stood before - and lead the world.</p><p>I hope to stay on &#39;Glee,&#39; I hope to still be a &#39;Housewife&#39; and I hope to do &#39;The New Normal.&#39; I just want to do it all! Why not? I&#39;m only going to be young for a little while longer.</p><p>I&#39;m Method trained. How is this character like me? What does she think of her mother? What does her mother think of her? It&#39;s like construction, and then, yes, you hope you&#39;re talented and that the universe aligns and captures the kind of laborer&#39;s work you&#39;ve done and whatever else sprinkles down on you, and it&#39;s all caught on film or onstage.</p><p>I really hope that we&#39;ll have a sustainable future on this planet, I really do. So I probably geek out mostly about learning more about how potentially we can hopefully make that happen, hopefully we&#39;re not too far lost.</p><p>To me, what I love about the draft is first, you see the young men who are realizing their dreams that they&#39;ve worked so hard for. That&#39;s a pretty cool thing. You saw the emotion from some of these guys the other day. And then, the second thing is this total sense of hope and optimism. And, I think that&#39;s great for everybody.</p><p>Gabriel Byrne is an extraordinary human being. We have two extraordinary kids and we work at it. We were always friends. He stuck by me through very hard times, and I hope he&#39;d say the same about me.</p><p>It&#39;s a pity that the tennis is really going down the drain. Every year it&#39;s getting worse and worse and worse. There has to be a radical change, and I hope it will be really soon.</p><p>The one thing I would hope would go on my tombstone is, &#39;I made my parents proud.&#39;</p><p>President Obama chose politics over leadership. &#39;Hope&#39; and &#39;Change&#39; have become bait-and-switch.</p><p>I&#39;d die if I was Madonna. I&#39;d die. God, what a horrible way to live. And Michael Jackson! To be so famous and to feel so isolated. I feel so bad for them. I don&#39;t know how it feels, and I hope it never happens to me.</p><p>It&#39;s a different outlook, and one that I understand. When you are a former member of the Warsaw Pact, when you have lived behind the Berlin Wall, when you have experienced the communist systems that existed in these countries, for them, the West represents hope.</p><p>I tried to use words that were dealing with the emotional quality that any human being could recognize in the way that they felt about their country. It&#39;s to do with the world we live in. That world is a brutal one and full of war. It&#39;s also full of many wonderful things and love and hope.</p><p>I think there&#39;s been a decline in the public&#39;s access to what&#39;s being done with their tax dollars, what&#39;s being done in their name. I hope that that will be repaired.</p><p>You know, this is a war of ideology, a war of thoughts and of faith. And we need people to really stand for faith and trust, not hope and change.</p><p>I still have, I hope, a lot of years and there are still a lot of things I want to do.</p><p>Zhang Yimou tried to use martial arts to talk about Chinese culture, Chinese people. What do they think, what do they want and what do they hope.</p><p>Writing a song is much like being an author. Yes, we all have tools to write (everyone has a brain I hope!), but that doesn&#39;t all of a sudden make us best selling authors.</p><p>I hope that my investment into Atomico will become my best financial investment to date.</p><p>Open markets offer the only realistic hope of pulling billions of people in developing countries out of abject poverty, while sustaining prosperity in the industrialized world.</p><p>We need to keep hope alive and strive to do better.</p><p>I am encouraged that there&#39;s going to be much better dialogue between the federal government and the state of Arizona. I mean, I hope that&#39;s not wishful thinking.</p><p>So you know, I think that the federal government, the Democrats, and President Obama are selling a lot of hope and change, but no delivery of any of those promises.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot of great people out here, I just appreciate it and hope everybody has had fun because I&#39;ve enjoyed my ride.</p><p>It is my fervent hope and prayer that by exposing my mistakes and by pointing out the things that were a part of my early life, some who might be following the same paths might not make those same mistakes.</p><p>I hope everybody&#39;s had fun, because I&#39;ve enjoyed my ride. I can tell you that. Now it&#39;s time to step aside and let some other young kid come in and win. Hopefully, they will, too.</p><p>I was sort of in denial about doing country for awhile but I sort of grew up and realized who I was, what I wanted to say. I think country music is the best music in the world and I&#39;m glad to be doing a country album. I hope people will love it as much as I loved making it.</p><p>I hope to refine music, study it, try to find some area that I can unlock. I don&#39;t quite know how to explain it but it&#39;s there. These can&#39;t be the only notes in the world, there&#39;s got to be other notes some place, in some dimension, between the cracks on the piano keys.</p><p>If you&#39;ve never felt that you quite got a hold of it, you just feel that before you die, you&#39;ve got to try and get it right once. And hope that the experience you have makes up for the some of the diminishing energy.</p><p>A joke is a very serious thing.</p><p>Humor is mankind&#39;s greatest blessing.</p><p>Common sense and a sense of humor are the same thing, moving at different speeds. A sense of humor is just common sense, dancing.</p><p>If I had no sense of humor, I would long ago have committed suicide.</p><p>A person without a sense of humor is like a wagon without springs. It&#39;s jolted by every pebble on the road.</p><p>Everything human is pathetic. The secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven.</p><p>A sense of humor... is needed armor. Joy in one&#39;s heart and some laughter on one&#39;s lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life.</p><p>The secret source of humor is not joy but sorrow there is no humor in Heaven.</p><p>You can turn painful situations around through laughter. If you can find humor in anything, even poverty, you can survive it.</p><p>Imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not a sense of humor to console him for what he is.</p><p>Everywhere is within walking distance if you have the time.</p><p>Start every day off with a smile and get it over with.</p><p>The secret to humor is surprise.</p><p>There is hope for the future because God has a sense of humor and we are funny to God.</p><p>When humor goes, there goes civilization.</p><p>Alimony is like buying hay for a dead horse.</p><p>A well-developed sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life.</p><p>My computer beat me at checkers, but I sure beat it at kickboxing.</p><p>A sense of humor is a major defense against minor troubles.</p><p>Humor is reason gone mad.</p><p>Like a welcome summer rain, humor may suddenly cleanse and cool the earth, the air and you.</p><p>Humor is perhaps a sense of intellectual perspective: an awareness that some things are really important, others not and that the two kinds are most oddly jumbled in everyday affairs.</p><p>Comedy is simply a funny way of being serious.</p><p>A taste for irony has kept more hearts from breaking than a sense of humor, for it takes irony to appreciate the joke which is on oneself.</p><p>Humor is laughing at what you haven&#39;t got when you ought to have it.</p><p>Humor is emotional chaos remembered in tranquility.</p><p>Wit - the salt with which the American humorist spoils his intellectual cookery by leaving it out.</p><p>Analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog. Few people are interested and the frog dies of it.</p><p>Humor brings insight and tolerance. Irony brings a deeper and less friendly understanding.</p><p>Humor is just another defense against the universe.</p><p>Wit is the lowest form of humor.</p><p>Humor is richly rewarding to the person who employs it. It has some value in gaining and holding attention, but it has no persuasive value at all.</p><p>Humor is one of the best ingredients of survival.</p><p>A humorist is a person who feels bad, but who feels good about it.</p><p>A sense of humor is the ability to understand a joke - and that the joke is oneself.</p><p>A pun is the lowest form of humor, unless you thought of it yourself.</p><p>Humor is something that thrives between man&#39;s aspirations and his limitations. There is more logic in humor than in anything else.

Your opponent must react at the same highest level.</p><p>It&#39;s through the small things that we develop our moral imagination, so that we can understand the sufferings of others.</p><p>Imagination is not the exclusive appanage of artists, but belongs in varying degrees to all men.</p><p>He is indebted to his memory for his jests and to his imagination for his facts.</p><p>The first piece of music that captured my imagination was probably Ray Charles Live At Newport.</p><p>I write from my imagination, not from what I&#39;ve read in books or seen on TV or to make money. I wrote from an idea I was passionate about.</p><p>Someone once said that history has more imagination than all the scenario writers in the Pentagon, and we have a lot of scenario writers here. No one ever wrote a scenario for commercial airliners crashing into the World Trade Center.</p><p>I don&#39;t like this idea of Method. I come from that school, but what I was taught was that it&#39;s your imagination. You do your homework, and you use your imagination.</p><p>The desire to live in our imagination is driven by this suspicion that we&#39;re disembodied sensibilities cobbled into our bodies. That idea has infused most of human thought since the very beginning.</p><p>I still have a photo on my wall of the greatest idol I will ever have in my life, and it&#39;s myself at eight. Because that&#39;s when the forces of imagination have the same value as the real world, when they&#39;re an instrument of survival: when my mother disappeared, and I imagined a mother. That was me at my best.</p><p>I like something where I can really use my imagination and be an active participant in the construction of the monster and usually that&#39;s in the world of the supernatural or the world of the fantastic, so that&#39;s why those kinds of stories about demons and the supernatural appeal to me or maybe I&#39;m really interested in that subject.</p><p>Our imagination just needs space. It&#39;s all it needs, that moment where you just sort of stare into the distance where your brain gets to sort of somehow rise up.</p><p>One way we can enliven the imagination is to push it toward the illogical. We&#39;re not scientists. We don&#39;t always have to make the logical, reasonable leap.</p><p>I deeply adored my mum. She was an extraordinary person, even for the prejudice I&#39;m likely to have. She was beautiful, amusing, a tremendous elaborator of things into comic proportions and extravagant in her imagination.</p><p>The human imagination... has great difficulty in living strictly within the confines of a materialist practice or philosophy. It dreams, like a dog in its basket, of hares in the open.</p><p>I&#39;m an emotional sort of person in general and I have a vivid imagination, so I feel the whole spectrum of emotion strongly when I write.</p><p>Ultimately, so much Dr. Seuss is about empowerment. He invites us to disappear into our imagination and then blows the doors off what that can mean.</p><p>I use a lot of film images, analogies, and imagination.</p><p>I am not interested in slice of life, what I want is a slice of the imagination.</p><p>There must be room for the imagination to exercise its powers we must conceive and apprehend a thousand things which we do not actually witness.</p><p>There can be no passion, and by consequence no love, where there is not imagination.</p><p>There&#39;s just so many great stories in the past that you can know a little bit about, but you can&#39;t know it all, and that&#39;s where imagination can work.</p><p>The thing that most attracts me to historical fiction is taking the factual record as far as it is known, using that as scaffolding, and then letting imagination build the structure that fills in those things we can never find out for sure.</p><p>You want to do something that shows some type individuality and talent and imagination - at the same time, you want to be truthful to the predecessors, because obviously the audience liked something about them and you have to replicate that experience to a certain extent.</p><p>A young imagination is bold, likes to make bigger leaps. It likes to, well, imagine that the dustbuster is a dinosaur that the computer mouse is a hotrod that the box is a cave that the rawhide is a torch... or a baton... or something.</p><p>Lyrically I like to use themes that make the listener use his or her imagination, and to give a little of the lessons I&#39;ve learned in my own life.</p><p>Many memory techniques involve creating unforgettable imagery, in your mind&#39;s eye. That&#39;s an act of imagination. Creating really weird imagery really quickly was the most fun part of my training to compete in the U.S. Memory Competition.</p><p>I tried to stir the imagination and enthusiasms of students to take risks, to do what they were most afraid of doing, to widen their horizons of action.</p><p>Dreaming is an act of pure imagination, attesting in all men a creative power, which if it were available in waking, would make every man a Dante or Shakespeare.</p><p>I feel very giddy with the idea of making my imagination take form and being able to put on a show where people leave feeling like they&#39;ve experienced something.</p><p>On the one hand, the guns were there to help capture the imagination of the people. But more important, since we knew that you couldn&#39;t observe the police without guns, we took our guns with us to let the police know that we have an equalizer.</p><p>How can a doctor judge a woman&#39;s sanity by merely bidding her good morning and refusing to hear her pleas for release? Even the sick ones know it is useless to say anything, for the answer will be that it is their imagination.</p><p>I look back into past history, the stored experiences or products of the imagination. I look no further forward than the evening.</p><p>Love doesn&#39;t grow on trees like apples in Eden - it&#39;s something you have to make. And you must use your imagination too.</p><p>I have been afraid all my life that I am going to die. All my life it has been stuffed in my imagination.</p><p>There is no better way of exercising the imagination than the study of law. No poet ever interpreted nature as freely as a lawyer interprets the truth.</p><p>We all know here that the law is the most powerful of schools for the imagination. No poet ever interpreted nature as freely as a lawyer interprets the truth.</p><p>When something is such a creative medium as the web, the limits to it are our imagination.</p><p>You will obtain a vision of matter that is perhaps fatiguing for your imagination, but pure and stripped of what the requirements of life make you add to it in external perception.</p><p>I have an imagination because my life is so boring that my imagination lets me get off the reality of what&#39;s going on.</p><p>I&#39;m looking for a way out of here. I can&#39;t have it physically, so I&#39;m going to have it intellectually. It was a beautiful thing to ride Seabiscuit in my imagination. And it&#39;s just fantastic to be there alongside Louie as he&#39;s breaking the NCAA mile record. People at these vigorous moments in their lives - it&#39;s my way of living vicariously.</p><p>My favorite literature to read is fairly dry history. I like the framework, and my imagination can do the rest.</p><p>I suffer from the delusion that every product of my imagination is not only possible, but always on the cusp of becoming real.</p><p>Vision gets the dreams started. Dreaming employs your God-given imagination to reinforce the vision. Both are part of something I believe is absolutely necessary to building the life of a champion, a winner, a person of high character who is consistently at the top of whatever game he or she is in.</p><p>Use your imagination, and you&#39;ll see that even the most narrow, humdrum lives are infinite in scope if you examine them with enough care.</p><p>I don&#39;t necessarily start with the beginning of the book. I just start with the part of the story that&#39;s most vivid in my imagination and work forward and backward from there.</p><p>I think my imagination dictates the technologies I use. But at the same time, my imagination can be technologic. Sometimes I see a tool and I know immediately how to use it, but most of the time I use the tool for an idea I already have.</p><p>Imagination creates some big monsters.</p><p>It&#39;s not only imagination, it&#39;s the distortion of the vision. You suddenly think, This person is idealistic, this person is strong, this person has dreams, when you know better most of the time. You put what you want to see on people.</p><p>I am an actor and I live in the world of pretend in my working capacity. I live in the world of my imagination.</p><p>Ellis Peters&#39;s historical detail is very accurate and very minute, and therefore is not only interesting to read but good for an actor to acquire a sense of the period. And the other thing I think is that an actor lives in the land of imagination.</p><p>Ultimately it&#39;s a leap of faith and a leap of imagination to put yourself back in time into those conditions and situations and see how you would react.</p><p>When we were filming &#39;The Darkest Hour,&#39; we didn&#39;t even know what the aliens were going to look like, we didn&#39;t even have a graphic reference. So it was definitely a big challenge to sell those kind of extreme moments when you&#39;re just generating them from your own imagination.</p><p>I believe that imagination inspires nations. It&#39;s something that I live by.</p><p>Vulgarity begins when imagination succumbs to the explicit.</p><p>Under no stretch of imagination can war be regarded as an ethical process yet war, force, terror, and propaganda were the evolutionary means employed to weld the German people into a tribal whole.</p><p>I always believe it&#39;s better to have 30 imaginations working on a project, rather than one imagination telling the other 29 what to do.</p><p>I have enough love to last me a lifetime! Thank God I&#39;ll never lose my imagination and my passion. That&#39;s really what it is. I&#39;m still passionate about what I do.</p><p>Clearly, some creative thinking is badly needed if humans are to have a future beyond Earth. Returning to the Moon may be worthy and attainable, but it fails to capture the public&#39;s imagination. What does get people excited is the prospect of a mission to Mars.</p><p>Literary imagination is an aesthetic object offered by a writer to a lover of books.</p><p>It was like there was a pile of kindling that was in the back of my imagination just waiting there. Once I lit it, it just flared up and I kept getting ideas and ideas.</p><p>We especially need imagination in science.</p><p>Reality is how we interpret it. Imagination and volition play a part in that interpretation. Which means that all reality is to some extent a fiction.</p><p>Never forget that the key to the situation lies in the will and not in the imagination.</p><p>I do as much comedy as I possibly can, but I&#39;m basically limited by the imagination of the secretaries who make the decisions.</p><p>Imagination comes of not having things.</p><p>It&#39;s what still excites me most about acting: letting your imagination go places it&#39;s never been before. There&#39;s nothing better than that.</p><p>Sometimes a technology is so awe-inspiring that the imagination runs away with it - often far, far away from reality. Robots are like that. A lot of big and ultimately unfulfilled promises were made in robotics early on, based on preliminary successes.</p><p>Well, I think that as a country, we&#39;ve drifted away from appreciating the importance of imagination.</p><p>We forget that what matters begins with the imagination.</p><p>I want to kick-start your imagination and let you discover the places it can take you.</p><p>Imagination is as good as many voyages - and how much cheaper!</p><p>I&#39;ve never taken any issue off the table for lack of suitability. Only for lack of imagination.</p><p>They seem much rarer now, those auteur films that come out of a director&#39;s imagination and are elliptical and hermetic. All those films that got me into independent cinema when I was watching it seem thin on the ground.</p><p>I always wanted to ride a dragon myself, so I decided to do this for a year in my imagination.</p><p>Just about this time, when in imagination I was so great a warrior, I had good use in real life for more strength, as I was no longer taken to school by the nurse, but instead had myself to protect my brother, two years my junior.</p><p>I hope that I&#39;m sexy in a different kind of way than I think that a lot of girls are right now. I think a lot of girls in the public eye, especially musical artists, are just kind of objectified a little bit and wearing super-skimpy outfits and leaving nothing to the imagination.</p><p>Only in your imagination can you revise.</p><p>It&#39;s a great excuse and luxury, having a job and blaming it for your inability to do your own art. When you don&#39;t have to work, you are left with the horror of facing your own lack of imagination and your own emptiness. A devastating possibility when finally time is your own.</p><p>The peculiar fascination which the South held over my imagination and my limited capital decided me in favor of Atlanta University so about the last of September I bade farewell to the friends and scenes of my boyhood and boarded a train for the South.</p><p>But I&#39;m never gonna get to a point in my life where what it costs to shoot a movie is going to determine what it is. The limits of my imagination is the only thing that&#39;s gonna stop me.</p><p>You have to just go with your imagination, where your instinct takes you.</p><p>Death is the tyrant of the imagination.</p><p>Well, the fact is that one imagination is critically important, and if you have had your imagination stimulated by what is basically a variety of subjects, you are much more amenable to accepting, to understanding and interacting with the realities of the world.</p><p>I&#39;ll confess right here that I secretly wish I&#39;d have drawn a strip about a little boy with a fake tiger, going for adventures throughout the universe in spaceships of his imagination.</p><p>Fairy tales opened up a door into my imagination - they don&#39;t conform to the reality that&#39;s around you as a child. I started reading when I was three and read everything, but I wanted to be an actress.</p><p>Busted is not the ideal band I&#39;d like to be in by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>Charles Laughton, who&#39;s a great hero of mine, only ever made one film and it happens to be one of the great films ever, which is &#39;The Night of the Hunter.&#39; It&#39;s full of his kind of imagination and creation and how you do things and just in the way he used the studio, I just thought it was a fantastical way of using the studio.</p><p>I think I&#39;m an actor because I have very strong imagination and empathy. I never studied acting, but those two qualities are exactly the qualities that make for an activist.</p><p>The moment of inspiration can come from memory, or language, or the imagination, or experience - anything that makes an impression forcibly enough for language to form.</p><p>President Reagan was a leader at a time when the American people most needed leadership. He outlined a vision that captured the imagination of the free world, a vision that toppled the Communist empire and freed countless millions.</p><p>So much of what we do as artists is a combination of personal experience and imagination, and how that all creeps into your work is not so linear.</p><p>I&#39;ve never really had a problem with the imagination level of an audience. They&#39;re always smarter and savvier than any studio exec will give them credit for.</p><p>It is not enough to know your craft - you have to have feeling. Science is all very well, but for us imagination is worth far more.</p><p>I have deliberately left Sylvester and Julia&#39;s appearances to the reader&#39;s imagination.</p><p>Imagination which comes into play in falling in love is different from any other. Certainly in my case, and I&#39;ve fallen in love all my life, one imagines the person to be as you want them to be. They frequently turn out to be someone different, for better or worse.</p><p>My life has been a gift up to this point, and I&#39;ve been blessed beyond my wildest imagination. And wherever this ride takes me is where I&#39;m going.</p><p>A place makes a deep impression on you when you&#39;re young. It lives with you. It&#39;s like your childhood. It fertilises the imagination.</p><p>For some reason I can&#39;t explain, artist and musicians tend to look younger than our age. Being in music, you need this youthful sense of discovery and wonder for what you&#39;re doing and keep your imagination open. That&#39;s a youthful way of looking at life and I think that reflects in how you age.</p><p>On &#39;Into The Wild&#39; I spent months risking my life and on &#39;Speed Racer&#39; I spent 60 days acting in front of a green screen. No danger to my physical self, but I sure had to use my imagination.</p><p>We also maintain - again with perfect truth - that mystery is more than half of beauty, the element of strangeness that stirs the senses through the imagination.</p><p>Then there was Clark Ashton Smith, who wrote for Weird Tales and who had a wild imagination. He wasn&#39;t a very talented writer, but his imagination was wonderful.</p><p>The thing about imagination is that by the very act of putting it down, there must be some truth in one&#39;s own imagination.</p><p>I mean, the most important thing to me is imagination.</p><p>You&#39;d have to have one hell of an imagination to completely make up a story, but historians are very anal about what they think should be portrayed on screen. Thankfully they don&#39;t make movies we do.</p><p>They are imaginary characters. But perhaps not solely the products of my imagination, since there are some aspects of the characters that relate to my own experience of a wide variety of people.</p><p>I didn&#39;t really hear any other music other than what my dad was working on until I was 12. My recollection of hearing other music was that I liked some things that I heard but I always thought, &#39;Where&#39;s the rest of it?&#39; It didn&#39;t have the same amount of detail or instrumentation or imagination in the arrangements.</p><p>The costume that I wear on the show is a little snug and doesn&#39;t leave a whole lot to the imagination. I don&#39;t have a problem with it because of the way this character&#39;s been written.</p><p>Imagination needs to be fed.</p><p>The artist must bow to the monster of his own imagination.</p><p>I&#39;ve studied a technique called the Sanford Miesner technique, that teaches you how to focus. It&#39;s mainly about daydreaming. And the technique&#39;s really about imaginary circumstances. Using your imagination to sort of daydream about stuff. It makes you emotional in a scene.</p><p>In my imagination yes, I remember, when I was six years old, I was conducting all this concert in my house. But now it&#39;s real.</p><p>My true function within a society which embraces all of us is to continue an age-old tradition. This tradition is to create images from the depths of the imagination and to give them form, whether visual, intellectual or musical.</p><p>Shakespeare fascinated me. He hardly ever left the country. His imagination was worldwide though reading.</p><p>I&#39;m a better coach now than when I joined Celtic. The longer you stay in any job, the better you become. If you lose your drive, your enthusiasm, your imagination, that experience is no good.</p><p>There is no connection between the political ideas of our educated class and the deep places of the imagination.</p><p>Poetry is that art which selects and arranges the symbols of thought in such a manner as to excite the imagination the most powerfully and delightfully.</p><p>Sooner or later you must move down an unknown road that leads beyond the range of the imagination, and the only certainty is that the trip has to be made.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/quotes/edit/main/src/guide/my ways are.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/My%20guess.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>My guess</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/Nabokov.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Nabokov</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
