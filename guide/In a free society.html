If people want change at the top, they will have to live in different ways. Our major social problems are not the cause of our decadence. They are a reflection of it.</p><p>It is hard to feel individually responsible with respect to the invisible processes of a huge and distant government.</p><p>Let the people think they govern and they will be governed.</p><p>Washington is a place where politicians don&#39;t know which way is up and taxes don&#39;t know which way is down.</p><p>Democracy is the only system that persists in asking the powers that be whether they are the powers that ought to be.</p><p>I&#39;m tired of hearing it said that democracy doesn&#39;t work. Of course it doesn&#39;t work. We are supposed to work it.</p><p>Here is my first principle of foreign policy: good government at home.</p><p>Democracy is an abuse of statistics.</p><p>A corporation&#39;s primary goal is to make money. Government&#39;s primary role is to take a big chunk of that money and give it to others.</p><p>The fact that political ideologies are tangible realities is not a proof of their vitally necessary character. The bubonic plague was an extraordinarily powerful social reality, but no one would have regarded it as vitally necessary.</p><p>Talk is cheap - except when Congress does it.</p><p>The danger is not that a particular class is unfit to govern: every class is unfit to govern.</p><p>Government is a trust, and the officers of the government are trustees. And both the trust and the trustees are created for the benefit of the people.</p><p>I have long believed taxpayers make better use of their money than the government ever could.</p><p>To hear some men talk of the government, you would suppose that Congress was the law of gravitation, and kept the planets in their places.</p><p>The way people in democracies think of the government as something different from themselves is a real handicap. And, of course, sometimes the government confirms their opinion.</p><p>If human beings are fundamentally good, no government is necessary if they are fundamentally bad, any government, being composed of human beings, would be bad also.</p><p>Americans no longer look to government for economic security rather, they look to their portfolios.</p><p>Our nation is built on the bedrock principle that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.</p><p>Government alone cannot solve the problems we deal with in our correctional facilities, treatment centers, homeless shelters and crisis centers - we need our faith-based and community partners.</p><p>Bureaucracy gives birth to itself and then expects maternity benefits.</p><p>The mistakes made by Congress wouldn&#39;t be so bad if the next Congress didn&#39;t keep trying to correct them.</p><p>There are three species of government: republican, monarchical, and despotic.</p><p>Government is an unnecessary evil. Human beings, when accustomed to taking responsibility for their own behavior, can cooperate on a basis of mutual trust and helpfulness.</p><p>The essence of good government is trust.</p><p>But no one has yet succeeded in reducing the size or scope of the federal government.</p><p>We live under a government of men and morning newspapers.</p><p>As a governor, I am naturally inclined to focus on the domestic side of protecting the United States.</p><p>But let us remember, at the same time, government is sacred, and not to be trifled with.</p><p>If we can but prevent the government from wasting the labours of the people, under the pretence of taking care of them, they must become happy.</p><p>When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. When the government fears the people, there is liberty.</p><p>A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul.</p><p>My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government.</p><p>This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or exercise their revolutionary right to overthrow it.</p><p>Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable - a most sacred right - a right, which we hope and believe, is to liberate the world.</p><p>Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.</p><p>Man is not free unless government is limited.</p><p>Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves.</p><p>No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we&#39;ll ever see on this earth!</p><p>Government&#39;s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.</p><p>Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.</p><p>Government&#39;s first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives.</p><p>Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.</p><p>A Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government, and what no just government should refuse, or rest on inference.</p><p>Nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.</p><p>If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there&#39;d be a shortage of sand.</p><p>The problem is not that people are taxed too little, the problem is that government spends too much.</p><p>The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next.</p><p>We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by brute force.</p><p>The most terrifying words in the English language are: I&#39;m from the government and I&#39;m here to help.</p><p>Loyalty to the country always. Loyalty to the government when it deserves it.</p><p>The people will save their government, if the government itself will allow them.</p><p>Government does not solve problems it subsidizes them.</p><p>Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.</p><p>The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only object of good government.</p><p>It is amazing that people who think we cannot afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, and medication somehow think that we can afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, medication and a government bureaucracy to administer it.</p><p>Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country.</p><p>Government is like a baby. An alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other.</p><p>When the government violates the people&#39;s rights, insurrection is, for the people and for each portion of the people, the most sacred of the rights and the most indispensible of duties.</p><p>It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.</p><p>The republican is the only form of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the rights of mankind.</p><p>The Chinese government wants me to say that for many centuries Tibet has been part of China. Even if I make that statement, many people would just laugh. And my statement will not change past history. History is history.</p><p>Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.</p><p>The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive.</p><p>Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question.</p><p>History, in general, only informs us of what bad government is.</p><p>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.</p><p>When I am abroad, I always make it a rule never to criticize or attack the government of my own country. I make up for lost time when I come home.</p><p>Anyone who knows history, particularly the history of Europe, will, I think, recognize that the domination of education or of government by any one particular religious faith is never a happy arrangement for the people.</p><p>The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.</p><p>Conquest is not in our principles. It is inconsistent with our government.</p><p>If the machine of government is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law.</p><p>Potentially, a government is the most dangerous threat to man&#39;s rights: it holds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force against legally disarmed victims.</p><p>Democracy is worth dying for, because it&#39;s the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.</p><p>I own that I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It is always oppressive.</p><p>An oppressive government is more to be feared than a tiger.</p><p>So confident am I in the intentions, as well as wisdom, of the government, that I shall always be satisfied that what is not done, either cannot, or ought not to be done.</p><p>That government is the strongest of which every man feels himself a part.</p><p>No government ought to be without censors and where the press is free no one ever will.</p><p>Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.</p><p>Be thankful we&#39;re not getting all the government we&#39;re paying for.</p><p>The taxpayer - that&#39;s someone who works for the federal government but doesn&#39;t have to take the civil service examination.</p><p>The second office in the government is honorable and easy the first is but a splendid misery.</p><p>It was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.</p><p>Government always finds a need for whatever money it gets.</p><p>One way to make sure crime doesn&#39;t pay would be to let the government run it.</p><p>Protecting the rights of even the least individual among us is basically the only excuse the government has for even existing.</p><p>Over grown military establishments are under any form of government inauspicious to liberty, and are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty.</p><p>The most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out... without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane, intolerable.</p><p>The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren&#39;t enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.</p><p>The Democrats are the party that says government will make you smarter, taller, richer, and remove the crabgrass on your lawn. The Republicans are the party that says government doesn&#39;t work and then they get elected and prove it.</p><p>If the federal government had been around when the Creator was putting His hand to this state, Indiana wouldn&#39;t be here. It&#39;d still be waiting for an environmental impact statement.</p><p>Today, if you invent a better mousetrap, the government comes along with a better mouse.</p><p>I think that people want peace so much that one of these days government had better get out of their way and let them have it.</p><p>It&#39;s time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century, we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient, more transparent, and more creative. That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent.</p><p>My brother Bob doesn&#39;t want to be in government - he promised Dad he&#39;d go straight.</p><p>If liberty and equality, as is thought by some, are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be best attained when all persons alike share in government to the utmost.</p><p>There is no kind of dishonesty into which otherwise good people more easily and frequently fall than that of defrauding the government.</p><p>In general, the art of government consists of taking as much money as possible from one class of citizens to give to another.</p><p>He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.</p><p>Christmas is the time when kids tell Santa what they want and adults pay for it. Deficits are when adults tell government what they want and their kids pay for it.</p><p>Different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means, and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government.</p><p>I don&#39;t make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts.</p><p>Democracy... is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.</p><p>We are persuaded that good Christians will always be good citizens, and that where righteousness prevails among individuals the Nation will be great and happy. Thus while just government protects all in their religious rights, true religion affords to government it&#39;s surest support.</p><p>How does it become a man to behave towards the American government today? I answer, that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it.</p><p>The basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government.</p><p>What is ominous is the ease with which some people go from saying that they don&#39;t like something to saying that the government should forbid it. When you go down that road, don&#39;t expect freedom to survive very long.</p><p>When the federal government spends more each year than it collects in tax revenues, it has three choices: It can raise taxes, print money, or borrow money. While these actions may benefit politicians, all three options are bad for average Americans.</p><p>If the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.</p><p>I&#39;d rather entrust the government of the United States to the first 400 people listed in the Boston telephone directory than to the faculty of Harvard University.</p><p>Mankind, when left to themselves, are unfit for their own government.</p><p>If you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant. Personal liberty is the purpose of government, to protect liberty - not to run your personal life, not to run the economy, and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live.</p><p>A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.</p><p>A free America... means just this: individual freedom for all, rich or poor, or else this system of government we call democracy is only an expedient to enslave man to the machine and make him like it.</p><p>When any government, or any church for that matter, undertakes to say to its subjects, This you may not read, this you must not see, this you are forbidden to know, the end result is tyranny and oppression no matter how holy the motives.</p><p>By definition, a government has no conscience. Sometimes it has a policy, but nothing more.</p><p>Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.</p><p>Democracy is a form of government that substitutes election by the incompetent many for appointment by the corrupt few.</p><p>It may be laid down as a primary position, and the basis of our system, that every Citizen who enjoys the protection of a Free Government, owes not only a proportion of his property, but even of his personal services to the defense of it.</p><p>I am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the American way of life is freedom, limited government, and minding our own business overseas.</p><p>The art of government is the organisation of idolatry.</p><p>Fascism should rightly be called Corporatism, as it is the merger of corporate and government power.</p><p>The government is us we are the government, you and I.</p><p>The administration of justice is the firmest pillar of government.</p><p>Only government can take perfectly good paper, cover it with perfectly good ink and make the combination worthless.</p><p>Do not separate text from historical background. If you do, you will have perverted and subverted the Constitution, which can only end in a distorted, bastardized form of illegitimate government.</p><p>An ideal form of government is democracy tempered with assassination.</p><p>The punishment which the wise suffer who refuse to take part in the government, is to live under the government of worse men.</p><p>The real goal should be reduced government spending, rather than balanced budgets achieved by ever rising tax rates to cover ever rising spending.</p><p>The art of government is to make two-thirds of a nation pay all it possibly can pay for the benefit of the other third.</p><p>Society in every state is a blessing, but government, even in its best stage, is but a necessary evil in its worst state an intolerable one.</p><p>It&#39;s not tyranny we desire it&#39;s a just, limited, federal government.</p><p>A democratic government is the only one in which those who vote for a tax can escape the obligation to pay it.</p><p>I believe there is something out there watching us. Unfortunately, it&#39;s the government.</p><p>On account of being a democracy and run by the people, we are the only nation in the world that has to keep a government four years, no matter what it does.</p><p>Now, let me be clear. The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle to grave assurance that government will always be the solution. If this election is a bidding war for who can promise the most goodies and the most benefits, I&#39;m not your president. You have that president today.</p><p>Government is an association of men who do violence to the rest of us.</p><p>There are many people who feel that it is useless and futile to continue talking about peace and non-violence against a government whose only reply is savage attacks on an unarmed and defenceless people.</p><p>Things in our country run in spite of government, not by aid of it.</p><p>If you make any money, the government shoves you in the creek once a year with it in your pockets, and all that don&#39;t get wet you can keep.</p><p>Many people want the government to protect the consumer. A much more urgent problem is to protect the consumer from the government.</p><p>There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty.</p><p>I spent my whole life in the private sector, 25 years in the private sector. I understand that when government takes more money out of the hands of people, it makes it more difficult for them to buy things. If they can&#39;t buy things, the economy doesn&#39;t grow. If the economy doesn&#39;t grow, we don&#39;t put Americans to work.</p><p>It&#39;s easy being a humorist when you&#39;ve got the whole government working for you.</p><p>It&#39;s a good thing we don&#39;t get all the government we pay for.</p><p>The Great Depression, like most other periods of severe unemployment, was produced by government mismanagement rather than by any inherent instability of the private economy.</p><p>The greatest advances of civilization, whether in architecture or painting, in science and literature, in industry or agriculture, have never come from centralized government.</p><p>There is only one kind of freedom and that&#39;s individual liberty. Our lives come from our creator and our liberty comes from our creator. It has nothing to do with government granting it.</p><p>The only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the goverment.</p><p>I am sometimes a fox and sometimes a lion. The whole secret of government lies in knowing when to be the one or the other.</p><p>I was ecstatic they re-named &#39;French Fries&#39; as &#39;Freedom Fries&#39;. Grown men and women in positions of power in the U.S. government showing themselves as idiots.</p><p>When one gets in bed with government, one must expect the diseases it spreads.</p><p>I am absolutely opposed to a national ID card. This is a total contradiction of what a free society is all about. The purpose of government is to protect the secrecy and the privacy of all individuals, not the secrecy of government. We don&#39;t need a national ID card.</p><p>There&#39;s no trick to being a humorist when you have the whole government working for you.</p><p>The Internet didn&#39;t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet. The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.</p><p>The happiness of society is the end of government.</p><p>Not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our government to give employment to idle men.</p><p>We believe in individual initiative, personal responsibility, opportunity, freedom, small government, the Constitution. These principles, these American principles are key to getting our economy back to being successful and leading the world.</p><p>Dependency is death to initiative, to risk-taking and opportunity. It&#39;s time to stop the spread of government dependency and fight it like the poison it is.</p><p>Freedom isn&#39;t free. It shouldn&#39;t be a bragging point that &#39;Oh, I don&#39;t get involved in politics,&#39; as if that makes someone cleaner. No, that makes you derelict of duty in a republic. Liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didn&#39;t insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable.</p><p>The ideal form of government is democracy tempered with assassination.</p><p>The best government is a benevolent tyranny tempered by an occasional assassination.</p><p>Government is taking 40 percent of the GDP. And that&#39;s at the state, local and federal level. President Obama has taken government spending at the federal level from 20 percent to 25 percent. Look, at some point, you cease being a free economy, and you become a government economy. And we&#39;ve got to stop that.</p><p>The universe never did make sense I suspect it was built on government contract.</p><p>Life in general has never been even close to fair, so the pretense that the government can make it fair is a valuable and inexhaustible asset to politicians who want to expand government.</p><p>The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government.</p><p>I&#39;m not really conservative. I&#39;m conservative on certain things. I believe in less government. I believe in fiscal responsibility and all those things that maybe Republicans used to believe in but don&#39;t any more.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with describing Conservatism as protecting the Constitution, protecting all things that limit government. Government is the enemy of liberty. Government should be very restrained.</p><p>The Negro revolution is controlled by foxy white liberals, by the Government itself. But the Black Revolution is controlled only by God.</p><p>The worst government is often the most moral. One composed of cynics is often very tolerant and humane. But when fanatics are on top there is no limit to oppression.</p><p>And a special thank you to the citizens of Massachusetts: You are paying all the taxes, creating all the jobs, raising all the children. This government is yours. Thank you for letting me serve you. I love this job.</p><p>The highest glory of the American Revolution was this: it connected in one indissoluble bond the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.</p><p>The best government is that which teaches us to govern ourselves.</p><p>I believe that all government is evil, and that trying to improve it is largely a waste of time.</p><p>Just in general, any government throughout history hasn&#39;t really wanted its people to be educated, because then they couldn&#39;t control them as easily.</p><p>The world runs on individuals pursuing their self interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn&#39;t construct his theory under order from a, from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn&#39;t revolutionize the automobile industry that way.</p><p>All government, of course, is against liberty.</p><p>Perhaps religious conscience upsets the designs of those who feel that the highest wisdom and authority comes from government. But from the beginning, this nation trusted in God, not man. Religious liberty is the first freedom in our Constitution.</p><p>Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, and to make our lives better than all the programs of government combined.</p><p>Which government is the best? The one that teaches us to govern ourselves.</p><p>The United States Constitution has proved itself the most marvelously elastic compilation of rules of government ever written.</p><p>Every decent man is ashamed of the government he lives under.</p><p>Liberty has never come from Government. Liberty has always come from the subjects of it. The history of liberty is a history of limitations of governmental power, not the increase of it.</p><p>Democracy means government by the uneducated, while aristocracy means government by the badly educated.</p><p>Why has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of man will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint.</p><p>Just think of what Woodrow Wilson stood for: he stood for world government. He wanted an early United Nations, League of Nations. But it was the conservatives, Republicans, that stood up against him.</p><p>Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.</p><p>The right way to reign in healthcare costs is not by applying more government and more controls and making it more like the post office, it&#39;s by making it more like a consumer-driven market.</p><p>You balance the budget by restraining the growth of government and encouraging the growth of the private sector.</p><p>By making bold cuts in spending and commonsense entitlement reforms, we will make our government simpler, smaller, and smarter.</p><p>It&#39;s opportunity. It&#39;s opportunity, not a check from government - it&#39;s opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans.</p><p>It is horrifying that we have to fight our own government to save the environment.</p><p>A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government.</p><p>The answer for healthcare is market incentives, not healthcare by a Godzilla-sized government bureaucracy.</p><p>I would cap the amount of federal government can spend at 20 percent of the economy. Bring it back to 20 percent or lower. And say, we are not going to spend above that level. Democrats, they want to raise your taxes and spend more and more and turn us into an economy which is no longer driven by the private sector.</p><p>Our nation is too different, too diverse to say that what works in Massachusetts is somehow going to be grabbed by the federal government, usurping the power of states and imposing a one-size-fits-all plan on the nation. That will not work.</p><p>This President takes his inspiration from the capitals of Europe we look to the cities and small towns of America. This President puts his faith in government. We put our faith in the American people.</p><p>I know what it&#39;s like to start a business. I know how extra ordinarily difficult it is to build something from nothing. I know how government kills jobs and, yes, I know how it can help from time- to-time.</p><p>On one of the most personal matters of our lives, our health care, President Obama would turn decision making over to government bureaucrats. He forced through Obama-care and I will repeal it.</p><p>Democrats want to use the slowdown as an excuse to do what their special interests are always begging for: higher taxes, bigger government and less trade with other nations.</p><p>This is the America that I love. This is a great people. We can do anything. We can achieve anything. We&#39;ve got a government that has gotten in the way of the American people. We&#39;re going to change that in November.</p><p>Julia progresses from cradle to grave, showing how government makes every good thing in her life possible. The weak economy, high unemployment, falling wages, rising gas prices, the national debt, the insolvency of entitlements - all these are fictionally assumed away in a cartoon that is produced by a president who wants us to forget about them.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to transform America. I want to restore to America the economic values of freedom and opportunity and limited government that has made us the powerhouse of the world.</p><p>I think people need to be educated to the fact that marijuana is not a drug. Marijuana is an herb and a flower. God put it here. If He put it here and He wants it to grow, what gives the government the right to say that God is wrong?</p><p>No government can help the destinies of people who insist in putting sectional and class consciousness ahead of general weal.</p><p>I had the privilege of practicing medicine in the early &#39;60s, before we had any government. It worked rather well, and there was nobody on the street suffering with no medical care.</p><p>A Conservative Government is an organized hypocrisy.</p><p>No group and no government can properly prescribe precisely what should constitute the body of knowledge with which true education is concerned.</p><p>In other words, a democratic government is the only one in which those who vote for a tax can escape the obligation to pay it.</p><p>Well private money can take risks in a way that government money often isn&#39;t willing to.</p><p>All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act, is founded on compromise and barter.</p><p>My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.</p><p>The duty of government is to leave commerce to its own capital and credit as well as all other branches of business, protecting all in their legal pursuits, granting exclusive privileges to none.</p><p>In our civilization, and under our republican form of government, intelligence is so highly honored that it is rewarded by exemption from the cares of office.</p><p>To establish any mode to abolish war, however advantageous it might be to Nations, would be to take from such Government the most lucrative of its branches.</p><p>Government does not create wealth. The major role for the government is to create an environment where people take risks to expand the job rate in the United States.</p><p>Most of the energy of political work is devoted to correcting the effects of mismanagement of government.</p><p>The impersonal hand of government can never replace the helping hand of a neighbor.</p><p>A government of laws, and not of men.</p><p>Anyone who thinks that the vice-president can take a position independent of the president of his administration simply has no knowledge of politics or government. You are his choice in a political marriage, and he expects your absolute loyalty.</p><p>There is too much government today. We&#39;ve got to remember the government should be by the people, of the people, and for the people.</p><p>The reason this country continues its drift toward socialism and big nanny government is because too many people vote in the expectation of getting something for nothing, not because they have a concern for what is good for the country.</p><p>One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace, good people don&#39;t go into government.</p><p>Those who want the Government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination.</p><p>Even to observe neutrality you must have a strong government.</p><p>Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear - kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor - with the cry of grave national emergency.</p><p>We are beginning a new era in our government. I cannot too strongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy and an inflexible determination not to enlarge the income beyond the real necessities of the government.</p><p>I don&#39;t think the government should be in the trailer-park business. I don&#39;t think they know how to run a trailer park.</p><p>Freedom of opinion can only exist when the government thinks itself secure.</p><p>No one should negotiate their dreams. Dreams must be free to fly high. No government, no legislature, has a right to limit your dreams. You should never agree to surrender your dreams.</p><p>The income tax created more criminals than any other single act of government.</p><p>The federal government has sponsored research that has produced a tomato that is perfect in every respect, except that you can&#39;t eat it. We should make every effort to make sure this disease, often referred to as &#39;progress&#39;, doesn&#39;t spread.</p><p>Both the American people and nations that censor the internet should understand that our government is committed to helping promote internet freedom.</p><p>But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain - that it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case, it is unfit to exist.</p><p>In the long-run every Government is the exact symbol of its People, with their wisdom and unwisdom we have to say, Like People like Government.</p><p>As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics.</p><p>Perhaps the fact that we have seen millions voting themselves into complete dependence on a tyrant has made our generation understand that to choose one&#39;s government is not necessarily to secure freedom.</p><p>If everybody in this town connected with politics had to leave town because of chasing women and drinking, you would have no government.</p><p>A little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own, have rendered the great government of the United States helpless and contemptible.</p><p>One of my goals upon becoming Secretary of State was to take diplomacy out of capitals, out of government offices, into the media, into the streets of countries.</p><p>The nuclear arsenal that Pakistan has, I believe is secure. I think the government and the military have taken adequate steps to protect that.</p><p>If you are working 50 hours a week in a factory, you don&#39;t have time to read 10 newspapers a day and go back to declassified government archives. But such people may have far-reaching insights into the way the world works.</p><p>Nothing turns out to be so oppressive and unjust as a feeble government.</p><p>You know why there&#39;s a Second Amendment? In case the government fails to follow the first one.</p><p>A claim for equality of material position can be met only by a government with totalitarian powers.</p><p>While all other sciences have advanced, that of government is at a standstill - little better understood, little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago.</p><p>Gun control means control. It means control for the government and the government starts controlling the people.</p><p>I don&#39;t think the government is out to get me or help someone else get me but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they were out to sell me something or help someone else sell me something. I mean, why else would the Census Bureau want to know my telephone number?</p><p>And I have no doubt that every new example will succeed, as every past one has done, in showing that religion and Government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together.</p><p>For those who aspire to live in a high cost, high tax, big government place, our nation and the world offers plenty of options. Vermont, Canada and Venezuela all offer you the opportunity to live in the socialist, big government paradise you long for.</p><p>Whatever it is that the government does, sensible Americans would prefer that the government does it to somebody else. This is the idea behind foreign policy.</p><p>As long as our government is administered for the good of the people, and is regulated by their will as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property, liberty of conscience and of the press, it will be worth defending.</p><p>We don&#39;t need a weakened government but a strong government that would take responsibility for the rights of the individual and care for the society as a whole.</p><p>The black market was a way of getting around government controls. It was a way of enabling the free market to work. It was a way of opening up, enabling people.</p><p>A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce, or a tragedy, or perhaps both.</p><p>The essence of a free government consists in an effectual control of rivalries.</p><p>We must always remember that America is a great nation today not because of what government did for people but because of what people did for themselves and for one another.</p><p>The first duty of government is to see that people have food, fuel, and clothes. The second, that they have means of moral and intellectual education.</p><p>For Forms of Government let fools contest whatever is best administered is best.</p><p>The government of the United States is a device for maintaining in perpetuity the rights of the people, with the ultimate extinction of all privileged classes.</p><p>Any government that supports, protects or harbours terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent and equally guilty of terrorist crimes.</p><p>The mystery of government is not how Washington works but how to make it stop.</p><p>I also believe that government has no business telling us how we should live our lives. I think our lifestyle choices should be left up to us. What we do in our private lives is none of the government&#39;s business. That position rules out the Republican Party for me.</p><p>War should only be declared by the authority of the people, whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens, instead of the government which is to reap its fruits.</p><p>No Government can be long secure without a formidable Opposition.</p><p>I know it&#39;s going to be the private sector that leads this country out of the current economic times we&#39;re in. You can spend your money better than the government can spend your money.</p><p>If government were a product, selling it would be illegal.</p><p>Ever occur to you why some of us can be this much concerned with animals suffering? Because government is not. Why not? Animals don&#39;t vote.</p><p>That fatal drollery called a representative government.</p><p>I hope all of you are going to fill out your census form when it comes in the mail next month. If you don&#39;t return the form the area you live in might get less government money and you wouldn&#39;t want that to happen, would you.</p><p>A President needs political understanding to run the government, but he may be elected without it.</p><p>Government proposes, bureaucracy disposes. And the bureaucracy must dispose of government proposals by dumping them on us.</p><p>The future is not Big Government. Self-serving politicians. Powerful bureaucrats. This has been tried, tested throughout history. The result has always been disaster. President Obama, your agenda is not new. It&#39;s not change, and it&#39;s not hope.</p><p>Do we believe that the goal of government is to promote equal opportunity for all Americans to make the most of their lives? Or, do we now believe that government&#39;s role is to equalize the results of peoples lives?</p><p>Poor people cannot rely on the government to come to help you in times of need. You have to get your education. Then nobody can control your destiny.</p><p>Fiscal conservatism is just an easy way to express something that is a bit more difficult, which is that the size and scope of government, and really the size and scope of politics in our lives, has grown uncomfortable, unwieldy, intrusive and inefficient.</p><p>We need to understand that we as citizens and as a government in any community throughout this country have no more important obligation than to educate those who are going to replace us.</p><p>Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men&#39;s minds.</p><p>Politically, the world is so confused right now - there&#39;s so much suffering caused by various movements by various parties and people in power in government.</p><p>If any foreign minister begins to defend to the death a &#39;peace conference,&#39; you can be sure his government has already placed its orders for new battleships and airplanes.</p><p>Democrats think the country works better with a strong middle class, real opportunities for poor people to work their way into it and a relentless focus on the future, with business and government working together to promote growth and broadly shared prosperity. We think &#39;we&#39;re all in this together&#39; is a better philosophy than &#39;you&#39;re on your own.&#39;</p><p>What would annoy the most people most often? That is the true left-wing test of government intervention.</p><p>This used to be a government of checks and balances.

If you are not careful you could replace a bad government with one much worse!</p><p>We need a government, alas, because of the nature of humans.</p><p>The inherent purpose of American government is let people seek their own goals and to encourage them to be responsible on the various adventures they have on their way to those goals, good, bad, and otherwise.</p><p>The best defense against usurpatory government is an assertive citizenry.</p><p>When you decide to get involved in a military operation in a place like Syria, you&#39;ve got to be prepared, as we learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, to become the government, and I&#39;m not sure any country, either the United States or I don&#39;t hear of anyone else, who&#39;s willing to take on that responsibility.</p><p>The most important ways in which I think the Internet will affect the big issue is that it will make it more difficult for government to collect taxes.</p><p>And that&#39;s really what&#39;s happening in this country is a violation of the First Commandment. We have become a country entrenched in idolatry, and that idolatry is the dependency upon our government. We&#39;re supposed to depend upon God for our protection and our provision and for our daily bread, not for our government.</p><p>It&#39;s a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one&#39;s safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a government contract.</p><p>One of the things the government can&#39;t do is run anything. The only things our government runs are the post office and the railroads, and both of them are bankrupt.</p><p>I have no doubt but that the misery of the lower classes will be found to abate whenever the Government assumes a freer aspect and the laws favor a subdivision of Property.</p><p>The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived.</p><p>When one may pay out over two million dollars to presidential and Congressional campaigns, the U.S. government is virtually up for sale.</p><p>We got rid of a terrible dictator. We gave the Iraqi people an opportunity for a new life under a representative form of government.</p><p>We all hoped in 2001 that we could put in place an Afghan government under President Karzai that would be able to control the country, make sure al-Qaeda didn&#39;t come back, and make sure the Taliban wasn&#39;t resurging. It didn&#39;t work out.</p><p>Money is power, and in that government which pays all the public officers of the states will all political power be substantially concentrated.</p><p>Government has no other end, but the preservation of property.</p><p>The essence of Government is power and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.</p><p>We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper. Under this approach, the spirit of initiative - not political clout - determines who succeeds.</p><p>Government is an evil it is only the thoughtlessness and vices of men that make it a necessary evil. When all men are good and wise, government will of itself decay.</p><p>I don&#39;t look for much to come out of government ownership as long as we have Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>To restore the trust of the people, we must reform the way the government operates.</p><p>When the people become involved in their government, government becomes more accountable, and our society is stronger, more compassionate, and better prepared for the challenges of the future.</p><p>I would not give half a guinea to live under one form of government other than another.

It is true that he worked to reduce the size of government and cut federal taxes and he eliminated many regulations, but he also raised taxes when necessary.</p><p>A government, for protecting business only, is but a carcass, and soon falls by its own corruption and decay.</p><p>The new rage is to say that the government is the cause of all our problems, and if only we had no government, we&#39;d have no problems. I can tell you, that contradicts evidence, history, and common sense.</p><p>I only ask of the government to be treated as all other men are treated.</p><p>The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests.

We need to put each government expenditure online so every Floridian can see where their tax money is being spent.</p><p>The control of information is something the elite always does, particularly in a despotic form of government. Information, knowledge, is power. If you can control information, you can control people.</p><p>People forget... that we structured it so that the government, or the people, would be repaid with a really good rate of return. And as it turns out, that aspect of TARP, that&#39;s what happened.</p><p>As Americans, we don&#39;t see the role of government as guaranteeing outcomes, but allowing free men and women to flourish based on their own vision, their hard work and their personal responsibility.</p><p>Political tyranny is nothing compared to the social tyranny and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man than a politician who defies Government.</p><p>The government is tottering. We must deal it the death blow an any cost. To delay action is the same as death.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe we need the government&#39;s help as much as some think we do. That belief sets me apart from the Democrats, since their way of dealing with everything is to tax and spend.</p><p>The income tax is a twentieth-century socialist experiment that has failed. Before the income tax was imposed on us just 80 years ago, government had no claim to our income. Only sales, excise, and tariff taxes were allowed.</p><p>That&#39;s the definition of &#39;success&#39; for the modern Democrat Party. As many people dependent on government as possible is the objective.</p><p>Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25 percent for domestic government agencies - an 84 percent increase when you include the failed stimulus. All of this new government spending was sold as &#39;investment.&#39;</p><p>Every country has the government it deserves.</p><p>Most Americans aren&#39;t the sort of citizens the Founding Fathers expected they are contented serfs.

And I want any force, any person, any element of an overarching Big Government that would stop your success, I want that organization, that element or that person to fail. I want you to succeed.</p><p>Government stimulates the democrat party.</p><p>We are witnessing an enormous shift of collective consciousness throughout the world. We are at the precipice of great transformation within our culture and government.</p><p>This is a government takeover of our healthcare system. It is the government basically running the entire healthcare system, turning large insurers into de facto public utilities, depriving people of choice, depriving people of options, raising people&#39;s prices, raising taxes when we need new jobs.</p><p>The liberals think government exists to fix what&#39;s wrong with America. They find fault with our Constitution, our economic model and our core values. We disagree with the premise of their argument. We believe there&#39;s nothing wrong with America that an extra dose of freedom won&#39;t cure.</p><p>Every Indian outbreak that I have ever known has resulted from broken promises and broken treaties by the government.</p><p>Freedom of expression - in particular, freedom of the press - guarantees popular participation in the decisions and actions of government, and popular participation is the essence of our democracy.</p><p>The Federal Government should be the last resort, not the first. Ask if a potential program is truly a federal responsibility or whether it can better be handled privately, by voluntary organizations, or by local or state governments.</p><p>If Bush, as I believe, has reliable information on the fact that Saddam Hussein is making weapons of mass destruction, I cannot not support the policies of his government.</p><p>I think there are certain folks in Missouri that don&#39;t trust government.

It&#39;s called senility.</p><p>But then it hasn&#39;t really been a focus of our government to make us an educated people.</p><p>Under the doctrine of separation of powers, the manner in which the president personally exercises his assigned executive powers is not subject to questioning by another branch of government.</p><p>I am concerned about the whole man. I am concerned about what the people, using their government as an instrument and a tool, can do toward building the whole man, which will mean a better society and a better world.</p><p>The lesson should be constantly enforced that though the people support the Government, Government should not support the people.</p><p>Increased government spending can provide a temporary stimulus to demand and output but in the longer run higher levels of government spending crowd out private investment or require higher taxes that weaken growth by reducing incentives to save, invest, innovate, and work.</p><p>I think if you look at people, whether in business or government, who haven&#39;t had any moral compass, who&#39;ve just changed to say whatever they thought the popular thing was, in the end they&#39;re losers.</p><p>Many people around the President have sizeable egos before entering government, some with good reason. Their new positions will do little to moderate their egos.</p><p>I happen to agree with many of the liberal emphasis on compassion, justice and equality. I just disagree that it&#39;s the government&#39;s role to provide everything.</p><p>You know what the fastest growing religion in America is? Statism. The growing reliance on government.</p><p>Democracy is when the people keep a government in check.</p><p>Our government is founded upon the intelligence of the people. I for one do not despair of the republic. I have great confidence in the virtue of the great majority of the people, and I cannot fear the result.</p><p>In the inner city, there&#39;s a mentality that the government owes you something. My breakthrough came when I stopped feeling sorry for myself and took responsibility for every part of my life. No more pity parties. I&#39;ve gotta love me more than anybody else loves me.</p><p>We believe that the government has an important role to create the conditions that promote entrepreneurship, upward mobility, and individual responsibility.</p><p>The belief that recipients of government aid are better off the more we spend on them is remarkably persistent. No matter how many times this central tenet of liberalism gets debunked, like Brett Favre, it just keeps coming back.</p><p>Activist government overreach and ongoing economic stagnation have shown us why Washington should not try to displace what is best left to civil society.</p><p>Experience teaches us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government&#39;s purposes are beneficent.</p><p>Peace as a goal is an ideal which will not be contested by any government or nation, not even the most belligerent.</p><p>I&#39;ve got the greatest job in the world. There&#39;s no other job in government where cause and effect is so tightly coupled where you can make a difference every day in so many different ways and in so many different people&#39;s lives. It&#39;s a great challenge.</p><p>Every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches.</p><p>Democracy is not so much a form of government as a set of principles.</p><p>I didn&#39;t do improv in college, I never performed, I didn&#39;t do theater either. I was in student government, I was a history major.</p><p>In the late 1990s, some of the worst terrorist atrocities in the world were what the Turkish government itself called state terror, namely massive atrocities, 80 percent of the arms coming from the United States, millions of refugees, tens of thousands of people killed, hideous repression, that&#39;s international terror, and we can go on and on.</p><p>Government workers often get a bad rap, but it&#39;s rare for them to receive much appreciation when government works.</p><p>The government&#39;s view is that the best time to announce bad news, news that it doesn&#39;t want the public to dwell on is late on a Friday, when it will wind up in the Saturday papers, which if you were readers, then the week day editions. A holiday weekend is even better.</p><p>I believe we need to attract a new generation of the best and brightest to public service and I believe that government can be a source of inspiration, not degradation.</p><p>In a very weak economy, when you say &#39;cut government spending,&#39; what you mean is you&#39;re laying off school teachers and you&#39;re de-funding various programs that put money into the economy. This means you have more unemployed people that then draw unemployment benefits and don&#39;t pay taxes.</p><p>So the American government lied to the Native Americans for many, many years, and then President Clinton lied about a relationship, and everyone was surprised! A little naive, I feel!</p><p>I don&#39;t imagine Heads of Government would ever be able to say I&#39;m not an economist therefore I can&#39;t take decisions on matters of the economy I&#39;m not a soldier I can&#39;t take decisions on matters of defence I&#39;m not an educationist so I can&#39;t take decisions about education.</p><p>We are all representatives of the American people. We all do town hall meetings. We all talk to our constituents. And I&#39;ve got to tell you, the American people are engaged. And if you think they want a government takeover of health care, I would respectfully submit you&#39;re not listening to them.</p><p>We need to reclaim our American system of limited government, low taxes, reasonable regulations, and sound money, which has blessed us with unprecedented prosperity. And it has done more to help the poor than any other economic system ever designed.</p><p>Conventional wisdom on government&#39;s role in inequality often has it backwards. Tax reforms have resulted in a more progressive federal income tax government transfer payments have become less progressive.</p><p>President Obama&#39;s reckless defense cuts that are hanging over our cloud, hanging over the horizon could put almost 44,000 jobs at stake right here in Pennsylvania. we are not going to let that happen. You know why? Because No. 1, national defense is the first priority of the federal government.</p><p>In a clean break from the Obama years, and frankly from the years before this president, we will keep federal spending at 20 percent of GDP, or less. That is enough. The choice is whether to put hard limits on economic growth, or hard limits on the size of government, and we choose to limit government.</p><p>I think its rather peculiar. It&#39;s not in keeping with our founding documents, our founding vision. But I&#39;d guess you&#39;d have to ask the Obama administration why they purged all this language from their platform. There sure is a lot of mention of government, so I guess I would put the onus on them to answer why they did all these purges of God.</p><p>I can&#39;t really criticize the Tea Party people, because I came into the White House pretty much on the same basis that they have become popular. That is dissatisfaction with the way things are going in Washington and disillusionment and disencouragement about the government.</p><p>Say what you like about my bloody murderous government,&#39; I says, &#39;but don&#39;t insult me poor bleedin&#39; country.</p><p>To reduce deficit spending and our enormous debt, you reign in spending.

We&#39;ve come to take our government back.</p><p>Government works less efficiently when it begins to grow out of control and takes on more and more of the responsibilities that belong to the citizens.</p><p>It was settled by the Constitution, the laws, and the whole practice of the government that the entire executive power is vested in the President of the United States.</p><p>That no government, so called, can reasonably be trusted, or reasonably be supposed to have honest purposes in view, any longer than it depends wholly upon voluntary support.</p><p>The Bible must be considered as the great source of all the truth by which men are to be guided in government as well as in all social transactions.</p><p>The weather is like the government, always in the wrong.</p><p>But those who believe that what our people desire is big government are living in a state of delusion.</p><p>But America was founded on the principle that every person has God-given rights.

You should never depend on the government for your retirement, your financial security, for anything.

It begins with the principles of our founding documents, principles that recognize that our rights come from God, not from our government.</p><p>The problem is that when government controls the economy, those who can influence government keep winning, and everybody else just stays the same.</p><p>You know that big government doesn&#39;t hurt big corporations. They&#39;ve got the best lawyers and accountants in the world. You know who gets destroyed by big government? It&#39;s the little guys.</p><p>Unfortunately, President Obama&#39;s failed policies of new regulations, higher taxes, and Obamacare and his anti-business rhetoric have hit Hispanics especially hard. Big government really hurts those who are trying to make it.</p><p>Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. People have the right to expect that these wants will be provided for by this wisdom.</p><p>It&#39;s very difficult for the American people to believe that our government, one of the richest on Earth, is also one of the stingiest on Earth.</p><p>Government is the great fiction, through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.</p><p>World War II was the last government program that really worked.</p><p>Communism is a hateful thing, and a menace to peace and organized government.</p><p>As someone who worked hard for a Labour victory in the 90s, do I regret it? Not really. It was bound to happen. And it&#39;ll happen with the next government, and the one after it. Because all governments serve us. They serve the filth.</p><p>I decided I ought to pick a project that would not be controversial, that would not really cost the government a lot of money.</p><p>Government&#39;s role should be only to keep the playing field level, and to work hand in hand with business on issues such as employment. But beyond this, to as great an extent as possible, it should get the hell out of the way.</p><p>We tried to have diplomas without learning, we tried to have jobs without work, we tried to have houses without savings, we tried to have government without responsibility.</p><p>It is time we passed a balanced budget amendment and return this government to limited spending.</p><p>The time has come to tell the truth about the corruption of the government employee unions in this country.</p><p>Surely the President can agree with us, that theft from government is not good. I know it&#39;s bold. It&#39;s out on the edge. I know from a Chicago-Springfield background it&#39;s hard to fully grasp that honesty could be part of government.</p><p>People should be free, people should be unencumbered by regulation as much as possible, that big government always goes corrupt and the truth shall always set you free.</p><p>Both my parents are English and came out to Australia in 1967.

My parents, and immigrants like them, were known as &#39;&amp;pound10 poms.&#39; Back then, the Australian government was trying to get educated British people and Canadians - to be honest, educated white people - to come and live in Australia.</p><p>Knowledge about the economy, ideas about capitalism and government, the future of the world and geopolitics were things I was never really interested in.</p><p>America needs jobs, smaller government, less spending and a president with the courage to offer more than yet another speech.</p><p>In the rush to become all things to all people, the federal government has lost sight of its core responsibilities. As a result we&#39;re stuck in this frustrating paradox where Washington actually neglects things it&#39;s clearly supposed to be doing, while interfering in other areas where they are neither welcome nor authorized.</p><p>In the government schools, which are referred to as public schools, Indian policy has been instituted there, and its a policy where they do not encourage, in fact, discourage, critical thinking and the creation of ideas and public education.</p><p>Of all tasks of government the most basic is to protect its citizens against violence.</p><p>And you can&#39;t have a prosperous economy when the government is way overspending, raising tax rates, printing too much money, over regulating and restricting free trade. It just can&#39;t be done.</p><p>In my view, the Christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children, under a free government ought to be instructed.</p><p>Leaders at the highest levels of our government are undertaking a deliberate and systematic effort to redefine our government, our economy and our country.</p><p>And here&#39;s the fact: the fact is it doesn&#39;t solve the problem. First of all, if you taxed these people at 100 percent, basically next year you said, &#39;Look, every penny you make next year the government&#39;s going to take it from you,&#39; it still doesn&#39;t solve the debt.</p><p>I traveled the state of Florida for two years campaigning. I have never met a job creator who told me that they were waiting for the next tax increase before they started growing their business.

Maybe a minister does, maybe your belief in God does, maybe there&#39;s another set of moral codes, but I don&#39;t think government has a role.</p><p>Secrecy, being an instrument of conspiracy, ought never to be the system of a regular government.</p><p>The Canadian government continues to say they will not help us if we go to war with Iraq. However, the prime minister of Canada said he&#39;d like to help, but he&#39;s pretty sure that last time he checked, Canada had no army.</p><p>I believe the American people have a genuine and justifiable fear of government intrusion in what they instinctively know is going to be an ever more intrusive world.</p><p>Dishonesty in government is the business of every citizen.

We must tell our elected representatives to at least delay the Canada-China FIPA until it has been examined more thoroughly, and to reconsider the inclusion of investor-state arbitration mechanisms in all trade deals.</p><p>Government cannot do it all. As we work hard to break welfare dependency and get young people ready for the labour market, we need businesses to give them a chance and not just fall back on labour from abroad.</p><p>All too often, government&#39;s response to social breakdown has been a classic case of &#39;patching&#39; - a case of handing money out, containing problems and limiting the damage but, in doing so, supporting - even reinforcing - dysfunctional behaviour.</p><p>I think if you have a two-story office and you hire someone who&#39;s handicapped, it might be reasonable to let him have an office on the first floor rather than the government saying you have to have a $100,000 elevator.</p><p>Does the owner of the restaurant own his restaurant? Or does the government own his restaurant?</p><p>People in government and public life are being kicked around at a high rate of speed.</p><p>When people don&#39;t understand that the government doesn&#39;t have their interests in mind, they&#39;re more susceptible to go to war.</p><p>If you seek Hamilton&#39;s monument, look around. You are living in it.

Anyone acquainted with both black and white people knows this assessment is not only absurd but monstrous. And yet it is the law.</p><p>The Founders recognized that Government is quite literally a necessary evil, that there must be opposition, between its various branches, and between political parties, for these are the only ways to temper the individual&#39;s greed for power and the electorates&#39; desires for peace by submission to coercion or blandishment.</p><p>If, indeed, a firearm were more dangerous to its possessors than to potential aggressors, would it not make sense for the government to arm all criminals, and let them accidentally shoot themselves? Is this absurd? Yes, and yet the government, of course, is arming criminals.</p><p>Rarely in modern times has there been such a revolution in commercial sentiment as occurred in 2008, or such a display in government and business of panic and helplessness.</p><p>Nature is not simply a technical or economical resource, and human beings are not mere numbers.

It was a continuation of what I tried to do in government.</p><p>I have long said there are three distinct groups under the GOP&#39;s tent: theological warriors, who want to impose their social views on the rest of society Tea Party zealots, who say with a straight face that they want the government to get out of their Medicare and remnants of the pro-business moderates.</p><p>We are all used to paying a sales tax when we buy things - almost 9 percent here in New York City. The application of this concept to the financial sector could solve our need for revenue, bring some sanity back into the financial sector, and give us a way to raise the revenue we need to run the government in a fiscally responsible way.</p><p>Health care reform, the marquee legislative accomplishment of the Obama administration&#39;s first term, was passed before we entered the world of divided government.</p><p>The reality of split government puts a premium on creativity within the administration. President Obama needs to put the right people in charge of the agencies and then have them push the bounds of administrative power to change policy through those agencies. President Obama has a pretty good track record of this.</p><p>You can&#39;t have a situation in which companies proceed on a permanent basis relying only on cash from the government.</p><p>As more people rely on government programs, the harder it becomes to conduct the necessary reforms to preserve them to help our society&#39;s most vulnerable.</p><p>A wise government knows how to enforce with temper, or to conciliate with dignity.</p><p>I&#39;m not driven to get back into politics. It&#39;s not on my top five things to do before I die, but saying that, I may be in politics in the next year or the next ten years.

Government has not offered tax incentives for investment, as it has in a dozen foreign markets. Banks have redlined it. Industries have moved out, they&#39;ve redlined it. Clearly, to break up the redlining process, there must be incentives to green-line with hedges against risk.</p><p>We&#39;ve been so preoccupied with getting the government to behave in a fair and democratic way, we were not able to focus on the private sector where most of the jobs are, where most of the wealth and opportunities are.</p><p>We oppose the reactionary policies of the U.S. government but we do not oppose the American people. We want to have many good friends in the United States.</p><p>Is there any wonder why we are in such big trouble? Any question why the people don&#39;t trust their government anymore, and demand a change?</p><p>And I just think that we&#39;re at a point in our economic life here in our state - and - and, candidly, across the country, where increased taxes is just the wrong way to go. The people of our state are not convinced that state government, county government, local government has done all they can with the money we already give them, rather than the money that we have before.</p><p>Someone has to stay on the line and say, no, we can do this by cutting spending and reducing the size of government. That&#39;s what I was committed to doing.</p><p>Now, in New Jersey, we have more government workers per square mile than any state in America. But since I&#39;ve been governor we now have fewer people on the state payroll at any time since Christie Whitman left office in January 2001. That&#39;s the right direction, Mr. President, not the wrong direction.</p><p>Attending that Convention and talking with those people and many others convinced me that I should become a blogger in my efforts to reform the government and uphold the integrity of the Constitution and the laws made in furtherance thereof.</p><p>Nothing is so galling to a people not broken in from the birth as a paternal, or, in other words, a meddling government, a government which tells them what to read, and say, and eat, and drink and wear.</p><p>A government is the only vessel that leaks from the top.</p><p>I believe in the America people&#39;s ability to govern themselves. If government would just get out of the way and allow them to lead their lives as they choose, they will succeed.</p><p>I strive never to forget the real world consequences of my decisions on individuals, businesses and government.</p><p>We must force the government to stop the bird migration.

And I think that that&#39;s what the Tea Party was all about. It&#39;s getting back to a constitutional conservative government. And that is limited, but it&#39;s also effective and efficient.

That is what being in the United Kingdom is all about.</p><p>When the news is good, the BBC view is: &#39;Get the government out of the picture quickly, don&#39;t allow them to say anything about it.&#39; When the news is bad: &#39;Let&#39;s all dump on the government.&#39;</p><p>The American Dream, coupled with government subsidies of utilities and cheap consumer goods courtesy of slave labour somewhere else, has kept the poor huddled masses from rising up.</p><p>There is a Western world.

But, now, our concern is the Democrats are in charge and they&#39;re tripling the debt.

Every government program, every individual, we are all going to have to sacrifice.</p><p>It&#39;s counterintuitive, but the most divisive arrangement is when the same party controls both Congress and the presidency, a situation encountered in eight of the past 10 years. With government unified under a single party, the minority has the least possible incentive to cooperate with the majority.</p><p>You can have a revolution wherever you like, except in a government office even were the world to come to an end, you&#39;d have to destroy the universe first and then government offices.</p><p>Unfortunately, corruption is widespread in government agencies and public enterprises.

But with this freedom comes responsibility. That responsibility has been abdicated here by some in the media and some in the government.</p><p>And some of what we&#39;re doing in Government even now, some of the welfare reform programs that are helping lone mothers come into work are based on things that were very new under the Labour Government in the eighties.</p><p>This Bible is for the government of the people, by the people and for the people.</p><p>One of the essential elements of government responsibility is to communicate effectively to the American people, especially in time of a potential terrorist attack or a natural disaster.</p><p>All&#39;s the government should do is keep the taxes and regulations at a manageable rate, keep a decent standing army and get out of the way.</p><p>Government does not have a revenue problem government has a spending problem.

Or are we a country that is resigned to whatever liberty the government decides to dish out?</p><p>When decisions on nuclear power stations and runways are delayed and the government dilly-dallies, people think they aren&#39;t important.</p><p>Engineering undergraduates should not be charged fees. They should receive grants, not student loans, and the government will get the money back long-term from increased exports.</p><p>You can&#39;t fall back on the private sector and say, &#39;You take care of the nation&#39;s banking system.&#39; That&#39;s a fundamental function of the government, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the FDIC, etc. All of those agencies have a major role to play there.</p><p>In the Pentagon Papers case, the government asserted in the Supreme Court that the publication of the material was a threat to national security. It turned out it was not a threat to U.S. security. But even if it had been, that doesn&#39;t mean that it couldn&#39;t be published.</p><p>We all learn in school that the judicial, legislative and executive branches of government must check and balance each other. But other non state institutions must participate in this important system of checks and balances as well. These checking institutions include the academy, the media, religious institutions and NGOs.</p><p>Among the weeds choking out growth and good government are the hundreds of boards, commissions, and advisory committees that have sprouted over the years. They devour time, money, and energy far beyond any real contribution they make.</p><p>The federal government now spends one of every four dollars in the entire economy. It borrows one of every three dollars it spends. No nation, no entity, large or small, public or private, can thrive, or survive intact, with debts as huge as ours.</p><p>We are all in this together. We want to have, I suppose, a single point of entry so that anyone coming near a disability service can get a very complete picture. Government needs to understand that picture, and we need to be able to offer somebody a one-stop shop.</p><p>Watergate provides a model case study of the interaction and powers of each of the branches of government. It also is a morality play with a sad and dramatic ending.</p><p>All the measures of the Government are directed to the purpose of making the rich richer and the poor poorer.</p><p>The number of illegal activities were so large that one was bound to come out and lead to the uncovering of the others. Nixon was too willing to use the power of government to settle scores and get even with enemies.</p><p>We say to the British government: you have kept those sculptures for almost two centuries. You have cared for them as well as you could, for which we thank you. But now in the name of fairness and morality, please give them back.</p><p>Using these unnamed sources, if done properly, carefully and fairly, provides more accountability in government.</p><p>I&#39;m very, very concerned about the Bush presidency. I&#39;m worried about the kinds of cuts in domestic programs that mean something to a lot of people, including members of my family, who depend on certain things from the government.</p><p>Anyone who saw Nagasaki would suddenly realize that they&#39;d been kept in the dark by the United States government as to what atomic bombs can do.</p><p>Many health care providers, particularly physicians in rural and urban areas, are leaving the Government programs because of inadequate reimbursement rates.</p><p>I was criticized at some level within the Republican Party by those who say government should not be in the economic development business at all. My response is that the only country I know that doesn&#39;t have an economic development plan is Papa New Guinea.</p><p>It is unclear exactly how many law enforcement agencies are currently using this capability, but it is reasonable to say that while resource limitations used to discourage the government from tracking you without a good reason, these constraints have largely disappeared.</p><p>If the government fails to listen to your demands, then you will decide what is best for you.</p><p>If it does not serve the Iraqi people, there are only political means that must be followed to reform the government - a new government that we must give a chance to prove that it is there to serve the people.</p><p>I think the American people have become more reliant upon government and less reliant upon themselves and that they now tend to put security ahead of freedom, but I think freedom is the most important aspect of our lives.</p><p>Open the way before the new government to prove that it is for serving the people.</p><p>We must not tolerate oppressive government or industrial oligarchy in the form of monopolies and cartels.</p><p>The U.S. will ignore the opinion of the Iraqi people and it will compose the new government according to its own desires.</p><p>I&#39;m interested in the human impact of the giant foot of misplaced government. After all, we encounter it every day.</p><p>I don&#39;t want the chair of the government because it will be controlled by the U.S. and I don&#39;t want to be controlled by the U.S.</p><p>Acquire a government over your ideas, that they may come down when they are called, and depart when they are bidden.</p><p>I believe the government of the United States should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stance toward the Palestinian cause.</p><p>We need the private sector to create jobs. If the government could create jobs Communism would have worked, but it didn&#39;t.</p><p>I&#39;m against big bureaucracy in Washington making health care decisions. I just have an aversion to bureaucrats. But it&#39;s not just government bureaucrats. I don&#39;t like HMO bureaucrats and insurance company bureaucrats either.</p><p>So it was sort of an odd time because I had been hired, but my paperwork hadn&#39;t gone through. So I worked as an intern during the government shutdown, as an intern, but I already had a job.</p><p>I decided to run for governor because I got mad... I want to make government more directly accountable to the people.</p><p>Big-government proponents embrace both the power of the federal government and the idea that millions of Americans ought to be dependent on its largesse. It&#39;s time to return to our Founders&#39; love for small government. More is not always better.</p><p>There are a lot of good causes out there, but they can&#39;t possibly all be served by government.</p><p>I clearly believe a lot more than some of my coalition colleagues - Tories - in redistribution and using the tax system for that purpose. I also believe in the government having an active role in the economy, which is having an industrial strategy. I&#39;m not a believer in laissez-faire.</p><p>Republicans rarely criticize Obama for lack of empathy - in part because liberals have traditionally been seen as standing up for the weak and the vulnerable. Conservatives can be just as empathetic. But they believe that, in most cases, it&#39;s not government&#39;s role to be the primary dispenser of empathy.</p><p>Love is by far bigger than the government can ever be.</p><p>You can&#39;t win with some people. If you&#39;re not in government, you&#39;re criticised for being not serious. If you are in government, you&#39;re criticised for wanting power. That&#39;s the Labour party&#39;s line of attack, and it&#39;s a bit ridiculous.</p><p>The Left regards the Constitution as defective and outmoded - in part because it impedes the government&#39;s ability to control institutions, like churches and families, which stand between the state and individuals.</p><p>If you want to change the way your banking system is regulated, if you want to learn the mistakes of what&#39;s gone wrong, then you have to change your government.</p><p>For wide swaths of training and education there are valuable spillovers which mean that the private sector needs support from the government. That is why I have been so determined to protect and grow apprenticeships and put higher education on a sustainable footing.</p><p>I was very happy being a secretary. I loved working for the government. I was very happy with my life.</p><p>What the Lib Dems have failed to do is offer any meaningful agenda for government or for power.</p><p>One of those promises was to limit the size of government and to have the government serve the people - and not the other way around.</p><p>In Scotland, the indication is that for the Westminster elections at least, Labour voters are satisfied with their government.</p><p>I promised to empower the taxpayer - instead of a handful of big government union bosses.</p><p>The choice between a Labour government and a Tory one is sharpening minds.</p><p>These are tough times and under this Tory-led government many people in Manchester are suffering and getting left behind. If elected I will use all my energy, skills, experience and knowledge to stand up for our communities and get things done for the better.</p><p>I believe that smaller government is better government. But I also believe that in the areas where government does play a legitimate role, we should demand that it is done better.</p><p>As the prospect of a Tory government gets nearer, many traditional Labour voters - some who switched away in recent times and many who stayed at home - seem more determined to prevent that happening.</p><p>We are the ones looking out for the middle class. Who do think pays for the endless expansion of government? Its middle class taxpayers. Our reforms protect middle class taxpayers.</p><p>As the economy faces such difficulties, more tough questions need to be asked about what the Tories would do if elected. Their ideology of free markets and small government needs challenging. That has to be part of our job.</p><p>More people on unemployment benefits is not success in America, fewer people on not because we kicked them off but because they have been able to get a job in the private sector, because government got out of the way.</p><p>It&#39;s become unfashionable to celebrate political achievement, and Labour achievement even less so. And it&#39;s positively uncouth to be proud of something that this Labour government is doing. So, slam me for saying so, but I&#39;m really proud of the NHS.</p><p>I think most people believe success in government is how many fewer people are in government, not because you kick them off of benefits like unemployment but they&#39;ve been able to control their own destiny because private sector employers have created more jobs.</p><p>We in the Labour party know better than most that opposition is the easy part. What&#39;s more difficult is governing and setting out an agenda for government.</p><p>People create jobs, not the government.</p><p>Although my seat is a contest between Labour and the Lib Dems, it could well make the difference between a Labour and a Tory government at the next election. In terms of international development, this choice is a very clear one.</p><p>It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds. A Harvard education and a Yale degree.</p><p>God will not look you over for medals degrees or diplomas, but for scars.</p><p>A graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that &#39;individuality&#39; is the key to success.</p><p>Never go to your high school reunion pregnant or they will think that is all you have done since you graduated.</p><p>Knowledge is invariably a matter of degree: you cannot put your finger upon even the simplest datum and say this we know.</p><p>You are educated. Your certification is in your degree. You may think of it as the ticket to the good life. Let me ask you to think of an alternative. Think of it as your ticket to change the world.</p><p>I learned law so well, the day I graduated I sued the college, won the case, and got my tuition back.</p><p>It makes little difference how many university courses or degrees a person may own. If he cannot use words to move an idea from one point to another, his education is incomplete.</p><p>For a man to attain to an eminent degree in learning costs him time, watching, hunger, nakedness, dizziness in the head, weakness in the stomach, and other inconveniences.</p><p>Life is the most exciting opportunity we have. But we have one shot. You graduate from college once, and that&#39;s it. You&#39;re going out of that nest. And you have to find that courage that&#39;s deep, deep, deep in there. Every step of the way.</p><p>I always wanted to have my own album released before I graduated from high school.</p><p>This man used to go to school with his dog. Then they were separated.

Arnold says California&#39;s schools are so bad that its graduates are willing to vote for me.</p><p>When I was going for my graduate degree, I decided I was going to make a feature film as my thesis.

Some of the most educated people I know have never been near a university.</p><p>I think young writers should get other degrees first, social sciences, arts degrees or even business degrees. What you learn is research skills, a necessity because a lot of writing is about trying to find information.</p><p>For students today, only 10 percent of children from working-class families graduate from college by the age of 24 as compared to 58 percent of upper-middle-class and wealthy families.</p><p>At the School of Visual Arts in New York, you can get your degree in Net art, which is really a fantastic way of thinking of theater in new ways.</p><p>I did get a degree in special education.</p><p>When I graduated from Santa Monica High in 1927, I was voted the girl most likely to succeed.

I graduated from one and so did my mother. Private schools are useful and we often use public funds to pay for their infrastructures and other common needs.</p><p>Our record number of teenagers must become our record number of high school and college graduates and our record number of teachers, scientists, doctors, lawyers, and skilled professionals.</p><p>ACT and SAT each have their own parts of the country. The GRE has its lock on graduate admissions. And so, one could blame the companies, but really, economically, they have no incentive to change things very much because they&#39;re getting the business.</p><p>Having a college degree gave me the opportunity to be... well-rounded.

I don&#39;t know if you can remember back that far, but when I went to graduate school they didn&#39;t want females in graduate school. They were very open about it. They didn&#39;t mince their words. But then I got in and I got my degree.</p><p>Our promise to our children should be this: if you do well in school, we will pay for you to obtain a college degree.</p><p>The idea of winning a doctor&#39;s degree gradually assumed the aspect of a great moral struggle, and the moral fight possessed immense attraction for me.</p><p>My personal advice is to go to school first and get a liberal arts education, and then if you want to pursue acting, go to graduate school.</p><p>I think women as well as men are concerned about jobs and the economy and spending and, and other issues.

They&#39;re not traveling as much. When you were a college student, the next thing you would do on graduation was to take a year off and travel. That&#39;s what I did. I went to Indonesia.</p><p>I fell in love with theater there, and after graduation I moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting.</p><p>It was only when I finished the course and left my graduation diploma on the bus that I realised I&#39;d become an actor.</p><p>One of the most difficult speeches to prepare is an address to a graduation class, which is why I don&#39;t often do them.</p><p>At the end of four years&#39; time, at graduation, we were down to 12.

There is a greater happiness possible than to be lord of heaven and earth that is the happiness of being truly loved.</p><p>Since every man desires happiness, it is evidently no small matter whether he conceives of happiness in terms of work or of enjoyment.</p><p>The office of government is not to confer happiness, but to give men the opportunity to work out happiness for themselves.</p><p>What can be added to the happiness of a man who is in health, out of debt, and has a clear conscience?</p><p>Ultimately, all human activities have as their goal the realization of happiness. Why, then, have we ended up producing the opposite result? Could the underlying cause be our failure to correctly understand the true nature of happiness?</p><p>I can be forced to live without happiness, but I will never consent to live without honor.</p><p>Money, if it does not bring you happiness, will at least help you be miserable in comfort.</p><p>It&#39;s enough to indulge and to be selfish but true happiness is really when you start giving back.</p><p>There is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving.</p><p>Happiness is no respecter of persons.</p><p>To be able to throw one&#39;s self away for the sake of a moment, to be able to sacrifice years for a woman&#39;s smile - that is happiness.</p><p>I don&#39;t know the true meaning of happiness.</p><p>Those who won our independence... valued liberty as an end and as a means.

I was wrong, happiness is like a butterfly which appears and delights us for one brief moment, but soon flits away.</p><p>Happiness isn&#39;t happiness unless there&#39;s a violin-playing goat.</p><p>I certainly wasn&#39;t happy. Happiness has to do with reason, and only reason earns it. What I was given was the thing you can&#39;t earn, and can&#39;t keep, and often don&#39;t even recognize at the time I mean joy.</p><p>Happiness is perfume, you can&#39;t pour it on somebody else without getting a few drops on yourself.</p><p>I have often met with happiness after some imprudent step which ought to have brought ruin upon me, and although passing a vote of censure upon myself I would thank God for his mercy.</p><p>Try to make at least one person happy every day. If you cannot do a kind deed, speak a kind word. If you cannot speak a kind word, think a kind thought. Count up, if you can, the treasure of happiness that you would dispense in a week, in a year, in a lifetime!</p><p>I don&#39;t understand why Europeans and South Americans can take more sophistication. Why is it that Americans need to hear their happiness major and their tragedy minor, and as jazzy as they can handle is a seventh chord? Are they not experiencing complex emotions?</p><p>The art of living does not consist in preserving and clinging to a particular mode of happiness, but in allowing happiness to change its form without being disappointed by the change happiness, like a child, must be allowed to grow up.</p><p>The ultimate end of education is happiness or a good human life, a life enriched by the possession of every kind of good, by the enjoyment of every type of satisfaction.</p><p>There is no fulfillment in things whatsoever. And I think one of the reasons that depression reigns supreme amongst the rich and famous is some of them thought that maybe those things would bring them happiness. But what, in fact, does is having a cause, having a passion. And that&#39;s really what gives life&#39;s true meaning.</p><p>We&#39;ve got people looking at our seamy side and our sad side a lot of the time because that&#39;s easier.

But I would be bored out of my mind if I were happy all the time.</p><p>I&#39;ve run into certain geniuses of individualism - they are very few and far between - who live their lives completely on their own terms they are very powerful and have a great amount of happiness. We all should aspire to that.</p><p>As to happiness in this life it is hardly compatible with that diminished respect which ever attends the relinquishing of labour.</p><p>No human being can really understand another, and no one can arrange another&#39;s happiness.</p><p>There is no correlation between happiness and amounts of money.</p><p>Even when they have nothing, the Irish emit a kind of happiness, a joy.</p><p>And of all illumination which human reason can give, none is comparable to the discovery of what we are, our nature, our obligations, what happiness we are capable of, and what are the means of attaining it.</p><p>As a child is indulged or checked in its early follies, a ground is generally laid for the happiness or misery of the future man.</p><p>Well, there are two kinds of happiness, grounded and ungrounded. Ungrounded happiness is cheesy and not based on reality. Grounded happiness is informed happiness based on the knowledge that the world sometimes sucks, but even then you have to believe in yourself.</p><p>To play someone who is who they are because of the happiness and contentedness that they&#39;ve known in their life is interesting because of sort of how banal it is.</p><p>It is now possible to quantify people&#39;s levels of happiness pretty accurately by asking them, by observation, and by measuring electrical activity in the brain, in degrees from terrible pain to sublime joy.</p><p>Oh, I adored Mickey Mouse when I was a child. He was the emblem of happiness and funniness. You went to the movies then, you saw two movies and a short. When Mickey Mouse came on the screen and there was his big head, my sister said she had to hold onto me. I went berserk.</p><p>I adored Mickey Mouse when I was a child. He was the emblem of happiness and funniness.</p><p>Happiness is a matter of one&#39;s most ordinary and everyday mode of consciousness being busy and lively and unconcerned with self.</p><p>It is not the possession of truth, but the success which attends the seeking after it, that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him.</p><p>It&#39;s horrible when people are only interested in buying labels, because it doesn&#39;t bring them the happiness they think it will.</p><p>An institution or reform movement that is not selfish, must originate in the recognition of some evil that is adding to the sum of human suffering, or diminishing the sum of happiness.</p><p>I learned from a very young age that if I pursued the things that truly excited me, that they would reward in more important ways, like happiness.</p><p>I enjoy being happy every day, and hopefully you can hear my happiness in my music. Life is beautiful.</p><p>All people desire what they believe will make them happy. If a person is not full of desire for God, we can only conclude that he is engaged with another happiness.</p><p>One must never look for happiness: one meets it by the way.</p><p>Most people ask for happiness on condition. Happiness can only be felt if you don&#39;t set any condition.</p><p>True religion... is giving and finding one&#39;s happiness by bringing happiness into the lives of others.</p><p>There is no happiness in love, except at the end of an English novel.</p><p>When God loves a creature he wants the creature to know the highest happiness and the deepest misery He wants him to know all that being alive can bring.

A very wholesome and comfortable doctrine, and to which we have but one objection, namely, that it is not true.</p><p>America has believed that in differentiation, not in uniformity, lies the path of progress. It acted on this belief it has advanced human happiness, and it has prospered.</p><p>Remember the rights of the savage, as we call him. Remember that the happiness of his humble home, remember that the sanctity of life in the hill villages of Afghanistan, among the winter snows, is as inviolable in the eye of Almighty God, as can be your own.</p><p>There is no happiness for people at the expense of other people.</p><p>It is the personality of the mistress that the home expresses. Men are forever guests in our homes, no matter how much happiness they may find there.</p><p>I try to stress to my children that buying something never leads to true happiness.</p><p>Getting married, for me, was the best thing I ever did. I was suddenly beset with an immense sense of release, that we have something more important than our separate selves, and that is the marriage. There&#39;s immense happiness that can come from working towards that.</p><p>The pursuit of happiness, which American citizens are obliged to undertake, tends to involve them in trying to perpetuate the moods, tastes and aptitudes of youth.</p><p>Why does watching a dog be a dog fill one with happiness?</p><p>Happiness is always a coincidence.</p><p>I will always stay close to all compatriots, and share together the happiness and suffering.</p><p>All happiness depends on a leisurely breakfast.</p><p>My idea of perfect happiness is a healthy family, peace between nations, and all the critics die.</p><p>The gratification of desire is not happiness.</p><p>Happiness is a choice. You can choose to be happy. There&#39;s going to be stress in life, but it&#39;s your choice whether you let it affect you or not.</p><p>Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings. It is based on the experience of one&#39;s identity as a being of worth and dignity.</p><p>That is happiness to be dissolved into something complete and great.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/quotes/edit/main/src/guide/In a free society.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Immanuel-Kant.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Immanuel-Kant</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/internet.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>internet</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
