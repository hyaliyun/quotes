can learn as much about the history from reading about the present as you can vice versa, that is learning about the present through history, which is what I do for a living.</p><p>The Seinfeld motto: No learning, no hugging.</p><p>It disturbs me when Obama says in the State of the Union address that he wants to make dropping out of school at 18 illegal, because people learn differently and before

me when it comes to learning songs or scripts.</p><p>And where does magic come from? I think that magic&#39;s in the learning.</p><p>When we think about online learning, it&#39;s such &#39;early days.&#39; Bill Gates is a wildly smart insightful guy.

I watch them at least once or twice a month probably. And I never stop learning from them as a filmmaker.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been an avid reader. If I don&#39;t have a book in the car, I&#39;ll stop and pick one up just to have something to read. I don&#39;t even remember learning to read.</p><p>I think Russian people are learning that democracy is not an alien thing it&#39;s not a western invention.</p><p>What keeps you confident in a healthy way is knowing that everyone else around you is going to support you and teach you and you&#39;re going to learn from them.

And I think that I&#39;m just now starting to get a hold on what I do.</p><p>I really hope that we&#39;ll have a sustainable future on this planet, I really do. So I probably geek out mostly about learning more about how potentially we can hopefully make that happen, hopefully we&#39;re not too far lost.</p><p>I spent a lot of time in the school psychologist&#39;s office.

My mother thought I had learning disabilities.</p><p>There has to be innate circuitry that does the learning, that creates the culture, that acquires the culture, and that responds to socialization.</p><p>You have to study your field and you have to find out how other people do it, and you have to keep working and learning and practicing and ultimately, you would be able to do it.</p><p>I feel like I was writing as I was learning to talk.

And it&#39;s by exploring your life or experimenting or making mistakes and learning from them hopefully that you start to forge an identity.</p><p>I had an acting coach while I was doing the show and every week I could see my work improving. I really liked working on the show because I was learning new things every day.</p><p>You&#39;re always learning on different avenues and this is an opportunity for me to start on a fresh plate and start learning some other things that can really help me, that I need, and I want, to progress forward.</p><p>Children don&#39;t just play any more - they&#39;re far too busy learning to fence and taking extra French classes. In the end, you&#39;re actually doing more damage to your children by trying to hot-house them. It&#39;s far better to remain a calm parent.</p><p>I like working solo and it was a lot of fun joking around with the audience, saying things. I&#39;m only just learning how to do certain things.</p><p>To summarize, the particular song a male sings, and the behavioral responses of females to song and morphological signals, are not genetically inherited in a fixed manner but are determined by learning early in life.</p><p>I think the biggest thing was that I was putting pressure on myself leading up to Beijing. Now I am learning how to take that pressure off and seeing this as an incredible opportunity, but not like, &#39;I absolutely have to medal.&#39;</p><p>I don&#39;t think any other city in the world... the sun doesn&#39;t shine the same way anywhere as it does in New York. And then I guess everyone&#39;s very good at hanging out. Not in a crazy way, but you&#39;re just constantly interacting and learning.</p><p>I really believe that what happens one day affects the next, and I think that came from that experience of learning that if I told the score inning by inning, play by play, it built up to its natural climax.</p><p>Imagination is as vital to any advance in science as learning and precision are essential for starting points.</p><p>I think as an actor you&#39;re always learning, you&#39;re always trying to experience more things.</p><p>I think my books talk about kids learning to like and respect themselves and each other. You can&#39;t write a message book you just tell the best story you know how to tell.</p><p>There is only one thing more painful than learning from experience and that is not learning from experience.</p><p>The second half of the &#39;60s really was a kind of learning period, in terms of writing, for me.</p><p>I&#39;m now learning how to distinguish when I&#39;m acting and when I&#39;m not acting - offstage as well as onstage.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m just learning how to play the guitar. I mean, really learning to play the guitar.</p><p>As you get older, you&#39;re always maturing, you&#39;re always learning something new about yourself.</p><p>I think it&#39;s so important to keep learning and keep your brain active.</p><p>Learning how to get in tune with your field of energy and understand how to create your energy, expand that energy, and move that energy through your body. Coming back to your center, and approaching life from that center-to-line place... That to me gave me strength and understanding and hopefully wisdom to solve life&#39;s problems and challenges.</p><p>I wanted to translate from one flat surface to another. In fact, my learning disabilities controlled a lot of things. I don&#39;t recognize faces, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s what drove me to portraits in the first place.</p><p>Productivity is going to be a critical issue. And it&#39;s not just about getting more time for professors in the classroom. It involves reexamining the learning experience and restructuring faculty and the use of faculty time.</p><p>I tell students, &#39;If you are learning from YouTube I almost don&#39;t want to teach you because what you learn from YouTube it takes 10 times as long to unlearn.&#39; They do an approximation of the centre of the note, an approximation of the interpretation, a cloned version.</p><p>I really believe I&#39;ve been a good person. Not perfect - forget about perfect - but just learning by what I was taught and living by my own values. I might have stepped on a few ants - and a few other things as well - but I&#39;ve never hurt anybody.</p><p>I love the work, I love being in front of the camera and working with actors and directors and creating something. For me, it&#39;s like learning everyday.</p><p>I think when you&#39;re learning an instrument, you are restricted because much of it is the noise of individual theory and your ability to play the instrument.</p><p>Of course, I&#39;d like to produce and direct a blockbuster, but you gotta build up to that. So now I&#39;m learning from a bunch of little movies. And it&#39;s more fun with smaller pictures. It&#39;s more creative.</p><p>In any of the arts, you never stop learning.</p><p>I got started when I was 3 years old because my father was a music teacher and my lessons were free. Instead of learning to walk, you learn to play the piano.</p><p>I&#39;m learning something all the time. That&#39;s the way I want it to go, and that&#39;s the way I&#39;ll go until I am no longer on this planet.</p><p>Cops and robbers resemble each other, so there&#39;s not a lot to learn in terms of learning the logistics of committing the crime or investigating the crime.</p><p>I think jazz is a wonderful learning tool.</p><p>The top experts in the world are ardent students. The day you stop learning, you&#39;re definitely not an expert.</p><p>To make a kung fu film is like a dream come true, because I&#39;m a big fan of kung fu movies and I&#39;m learning kung fu for a long time.</p><p>I did learn Chinese kung-fu in a school for a short time, but I couldn&#39;t afford to pay for long-term learning.</p><p>I suppose I am a frustrated musician so I annoy my family by playing guitar in the house. I used to be into acoustic stuff but my son Joseph is learning drums, so now I have an electric guitar and we play Metallica. We have an amp and a PA in the garage with his drum kit.</p><p>I&#39;ve done some TV and I&#39;ve done a lot of theater, obviously, and the last character I played on Broadway was a very fast-talking broad. I&#39;m used to learning material and words.</p><p>I was just learning to play guitar when Tracy Chapman came out. She wrote these songs, she played them by herself and I so admired her for that.</p><p>My number one goal was not getting &#39;A&#39;s&#39; - and I proved it. I was a &#39;C&#39; student. You have to be ready to learn. If you&#39;re not interesting in learning, it doesn&#39;t work. As I grew older and wanted to learn and desperately wanted inside information, learning was a lot easier.</p><p>The rite of passage of learning to build a fire that will burn all night with one match is not an insignificant one in my husband&#39;s family, and I grew up camping and backpacking. I love to camp.</p><p>I believe that every role that I have done this far has had quality and content. My roles have been very demanding and every role has been a challenge and a learning experience that has helped me mature as an actress.</p><p>But the important thing about learning to wait, I feel sure, is to know what you are waiting for.</p><p>I have had many occasions this year where I questioned and second-guessed my decision in a game, but it comes down to learning from mistakes and being accountable for what you did right or did wrong.</p><p>I think the biggest difficulty is that when I&#39;m here in America, there&#39;s a necessity of using English, so I really have a great sense of really wanting to learn, but unfortunately when I head back to Japan, the necessity vanishes and so does my enthusiasm about learning.</p><p>I was fairly solitary. I didn&#39;t like structured learning. People didn&#39;t seem to be my cup of tea.</p><p>In addition to the research, I enjoyed learning French and assimilating the culture of another country.</p><p>In such an environment, I was able to study things that could be of immediate usefulness to the world. That learning experience undoubtedly served me well when I eventually entered the work force.</p><p>I am dumb when it comes to learning dance steps.</p><p>I count myself as one of millions of Americans whose life simply would not be the same without the libraries that supported my learning.</p><p>I&#39;m not a very good painter, but I&#39;m learning a lot.</p><p>The fundamentals of baseball haven&#39;t changed, but how we can teach those fundamentals has. With an e-book, learning can be more rewarding and fun.</p><p>Each experience I go through - marriage, my public life, my personal life - I&#39;m learning as I go.</p><p>In the past, I had my idols but today I enjoy learning from all the soccer I watch.</p><p>I was 17 and just learning what high fidelity was, what good sound was, and learning the mechanics of tape machines. It was a real education, going right from the consumer end to the record factory.</p><p>My entire learning process is slow, because I have no visual memory.</p><p>I want to keep learning, keep exploring, keep doing more.</p><p>I&#39;d love to be a saxophonist. I don&#39;t know why, but I pretend I&#39;m the saxophonist when I listen to music. I have about as much chance playing the sax as I do learning how to fly.</p><p>Learning to drive is a scary thing for a parent. I had to basically lie to get the keys when I was a kid.</p><p>I think kids slowly begin to realize that what they&#39;re learning relates to other things they know. Then learning starts to get more and more exciting.</p><p>I&#39;m still learning, and that&#39;s what life is about.</p><p>I only have one child. But I am learning that there is a lot to being a parent that you did not expect.</p><p>I always wanted to go to the Chavez school but I could never afford it when I was growing up so a lot of my learning came from magic books and watching other magicians. I was also very lucky that I had a couple of really good magic teachers.</p><p>Our libraries are valuable centers of education, learning and enrichment for people of all ages. In recent years, libraries have taken on an increasingly important role. today&#39;s libraries are about much more than books.</p><p>My one thing is I continue to be interested and want to be a student. I don&#39;t want to be a master. When I&#39;m learning something, I&#39;m in my element.</p><p>Today when I think about diversity, I actually think about the word &#39;inclusion.&#39; And I think this is a time of great inclusion. It&#39;s not men, it&#39;s not women alone. Whether it&#39;s geographic, it&#39;s approach, it&#39;s your style, it&#39;s your way of learning, the way you want to contribute, it&#39;s your age - it is really broad.</p><p>I&#39;m learning to embrace who I am and what I look like.</p><p>Art in the classroom not only spurs creativity, it also inspires learning.</p><p>Everything in life is a lesson and I have learned from each marriage. Yes, I&#39;ve made mistakes but every experience is a learning curve.</p><p>I love learning about different dialects and I own all sorts of regional and time-period slang dictionaries. I often browse through relevant ones while writing a story. I also read a lot of diaries and oral histories.</p><p>We do a lot of shows for young people who have probably never been to the theater before and they are learning about the Holocaust, which unhappily, many of them do not know about.</p><p>If you feel your school is failing you, the question is why. Is it a lack of parental involvement, large classes, school violence, poor learning environment? Are there any standards to determine where problems are? Are there tutoring or mentoring programs? If the school is still failing after 3 years then what are your options?</p><p>People trust I know what I&#39;m doing. I have lots of credibility. I&#39;ve had years of learning. I know and understand my business.</p><p>I&#39;m learning a lot how to be good at what I do and also how lucky I am and take it all in and be grateful for all this late in life success I&#39;ve been having and it&#39;s good to have people that have been around and successful for awhile and work with them and see how they behave and it&#39;s why they are who they are and why they&#39;re still successful.</p><p>I enjoy the element of pushing yourself, learning something new, whether it&#39;s a dance step, a scene, an emotion.</p><p>The director&#39;s job is full of all sorts of annoyances and details - like how many cars are on the street. Ugh. I don&#39;t want it. I like my gig. And I feel that for the next 30 years or so I can keep learning more about it.</p><p>Learning starts with failure the first failure is the beginning of education.</p><p>I think I&#39;d like to stay anchoring because, number one, I&#39;m learning a lot, and I love it when I&#39;m learning. And number two, I also have the luxury of a stable life.</p><p>I&#39;d think learning to play the guitar would be very confusing for sighted people.</p><p>My daughter, the one who lives nearby, is raising her children to be very much aware. We went on a nature walk on Monday I&#39;m learning so much from her.</p><p>I&#39;ve just been learning how to direct my own videos, choreography, doing costumes... every creative opportunity there is with my music I&#39;ve taken.</p><p>I spent many years trying to write a lot like Ben Folds or John Lennon or Rivers Cuomo. I think that&#39;s healthy when you&#39;re learning to write and seeing how chords fit together and how songs take shape.</p><p>In Britain, you do your job. When you do an American TV show, there is a sense of being one with the crew, and there is a leadership element, which was a learning curve for me because it is very different culturally. In Britain, you just do it, leave and say, &#39;Thanks.&#39;</p><p>Learning lines is my biggest challenge.</p><p>Learning can take place in the backyard if there is a human being there who cares about the child. Before learning computers, children should learn to read first. They should sit around the dinner table and hear what their parents have to say and think.</p><p>Belief gets in the way of learning.</p><p>I love talking about women because they are a constant study and you&#39;re always learning.</p><p>Learning teacheth more in one year than experience in twenty.</p><p>Young children were sooner allured by love, than driven by beating, to attain good learning.</p><p>Let the master praise him, and say, &#39;Here ye do well.&#39; For, I assure you, there is no such whetstone to sharpen a good wit, and encourage a will to learning, as is praise.</p><p>In mine opinion, love is fitter than fear, gentleness better than beating, to bring up a child rightly in learning.</p><p>Oprah was not somebody who was telling us what to do, she wasn&#39;t really teaching us like so many people we see today. With Oprah, she was learning and we were learning with her. And I think that&#39;s really was the seed that was planted for all of us to just hang in there with her.</p><p>Then as everything, like I say, things started to come together, when things started to go our way, that&#39;s when you results started to come. I was no different driver. I was certainly learning every time I went in the car.</p><p>When I have the time at home, I&#39;ll practice three or four hours a day. I have to. And I&#39;m a late starter I started at age 17 and at age 51 I&#39;m still learning.</p><p>I know it may seem surprising to people, but learning dialog that has a conversational flow to it is not that difficult.</p><p>But I think it&#39;s hard for me to only put out one record a year. Because I get too antsy. But it&#39;s good I&#39;m learning to do that, because each record counts. And you should make it count.</p><p>Maybe our young people are not as vacuous as we would like to lead ourselves to believe - that all they&#39;re interested in is hairdos and looking at other beautiful people. Maybe they&#39;re interested in learning something.</p><p>In the United States, we spend millions of dollars on sports because it promotes teamwork, discipline, and the experience of learning to make great progress in small increments. Learning to play music does all this and more.</p><p>There are hurdles to overcome in sport and in life. Sport is a very valuable learning ground for how to live your life in the best possible way.</p><p>Melville brought to the task a sound knowledge of actual whaling, much curious learning in the literature of the subject, and, above all, an imagination which worked with great power upon the facts of his own experience.</p><p>After the United States entered the war, I joined the Naval Reserve and spent ninety days in a Columbia University dormitory learning to be a naval officer.</p><p>Diabetes is a disease that&#39;s had a deep impact on my family. My little brother has had type 1 diabetes since he was a baby and I have spent time learning about the disease and trying to bring attention to it so that one day soon we will reach a cure.</p><p>It was a fantastic learning experience and OK, I got slammed because I wasn&#39;t Audrey Hepburn but you could have predicted that, really, if you&#39;d opened your eyes wide enough.</p><p>I want to direct, produce, and write, learning as I go.</p><p>An important aspect of the current situation is the strong social reaction against suggestions that the home language of African American children be used in the first steps of learning to read and write.</p><p>Everything is a learning experience.</p><p>I love learning new things that will never be put to practical use.</p><p>The Finland of the 21st century can thrive only if women of learning - in common with their male counterparts - are guaranteed the opportunity to use their creative potential to the full.</p><p>There&#39;s always a learning curve, where you&#39;ve got to learn what your subject is all about.</p><p>I played saxophone, so I was into jazz. I learned from each audience and each teacher that I had. I can&#39;t really tell you any rules or anything, but the way I develop my beliefs is really just by personally learning from different situations.</p><p>Learning is what most adults will do for a living in the 21st century.</p><p>Obviously, I&#39;ve been on sets before but nothing as big as &#39;Twilight.&#39; You forget sometimes that you&#39;re on set of one of the biggest movies ever- so when you just sit back and think about it its just so incredible. It&#39;s such a great learning experience.</p><p>Everything starts and ends with the song, and working with writers and really learning their process and craft was an invaluable experience.</p><p>Students who are interested in learning about the environment should not be dissuaded from doing so, but only if they have proved their proficiency in other basic courses, such as U.S. history. Until then, we need to focus on producing well-educated citizens steeped in their country&#39;s history and mindful of their civic responsibilities.</p><p>Some kids don&#39;t know where they&#39;ll spend the night. How can we expect them to focus on learning?</p><p>Under these conditions it is not astonishing that learning was highly prized in fact, my parents made sacrifices to be able to give their children a good education.</p><p>I&#39;m learning as much martial arts as I possibly can. My show is packed with action. Enough to get a rise.</p><p>The introduction of many minds into many fields of learning along a broad spectrum keeps alive questions about the accessibility, if not the unity, of knowledge.</p><p>The British system had requirements, including Latin. I&#39;m not positive you ever had to know Greek, but there are certainly kinds of curricula where you had to know Greek too. I think in Britain there was the most mindless, repetitive sort of learning.</p><p>I avoid the media circus, keep my head down and try to keep growing and learning things.</p><p>Pop songs are not as graceful as they used to be. Performers today haven&#39;t gone through the regimen of learning how to write. And of course, everyone wants to own copyrights.</p><p>Growing up, my sisters and I would always talk stories. One of my frustrations was I didn&#39;t know anything about cameras. I didn&#39;t know how to make a film and I obviously didn&#39;t have a special effects budget. I was a kid. So I was learning to draw to get down the stuff that was in my head, that I couldn&#39;t afford to actually do.</p><p>I come from Montana, and in eastern Montana we have a lot of dirt between light bulbs. It is expensive trying to bring the new technologies to smaller schools to upgrade their technologies to take advantage of distance learning.</p><p>When I left Bradford and got a phone call from Dave Parnaby asking &#39;did I want to come back in?&#39;, I was delighted to accept. The whole buzz at the club at the moment is great for someone like me who is still learning and wanting to hopefully go into management in my own right at some point.</p><p>Strictly Business&#39; is about a young black man who is learning about himself, and that applies to a lot of young black men, those who are trying to find jobs.

I write stories about women.</p><p>What I&#39;m doing is writing stories about women who care about justice. They are women who think about the difference between right and wrong, what&#39;s legal and illegal, ethical and unethical, moral and immoral.</p><p>Though every legal task demands this skill, it is especially important in the effort to frame public policy in a way that is properly responsive to human needs and predicaments.

As you know, this is an office with a long and rich tradition, not only of extraordinary legal skill but also of extraordinary professionalism and integrity. That is due, in large measure, to the people who have led it.</p><p>I&#39;ve become so earthy. And I never was earthy. I&#39;m doing all kinds of different roles which are not at all like the intellectual and the legal mind of Ben Stone.</p><p>Since 2001, the Patriot Act has provided the means to detect and disrupt terrorist threats against the U.S. Prior to enactment of the law, major legal barriers prevented intelligence, national defense, and law enforcement agencies from working together and sharing information.</p><p>Embryonic stem cell research is legal in America, and nothing in the administration&#39;s current policy affects that legality 400 lines are currently being used to conduct embryonic stem cell research, both in the private sector and by the Federal Government.</p><p>It is not unprofessional to give free legal advice, but advertising that the first visit will be free is a bit like a fox telling chickens he will not bite them until they cross the threshold of the hen house.</p><p>To play a lawyer and have one year of law school under your belt, you sort of know what you&#39;re talking about! I&#39;m able to memorize the legal courtroom stuff a lot faster than I would have been able to otherwise.</p><p>I later spent... five to eight months in hospitals in New Jersey, always on an involuntary basis, and always attempting a legal argument for release.</p><p>Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life.</p><p>In regards to The Haunting, people compared it to the old movie, which is unfair. We didn&#39;t have the rights to the movie. I couldn&#39;t duplicate a single thing because that would have been legal infringement.</p><p>We must make immigration a legal, orderly process to eliminate this issue, not further criminalize it.</p><p>There are half a billion people that listen to music online and the vast majority are doing so illegally. But if we bring those people over to the legal side and Spotify, what is going to happen is we are going to double the music industry and that will lead to more artists creating great new music.</p><p>There are millions of people who consume music illegally every month.

But I don&#39;t think that expanding the legal definition of copyright outside of actual copyright infringement is the right move.</p><p>It was not possible to broadcast any of that because of an agreement between Jackson and the family. Our legal advice was that we could not broadcast it.</p><p>Supercookies are legal, but I don&#39;t think they should be.</p><p>I feel like there was justice. It was served through the legal system you know. Everything that I endured. It was all worth it.</p><p>I have strongly rejected the proposal to pardon and transfer her to the United States. I do not have the legal power to pardon terrorists and even if I did, I would not use it.</p><p>Understand that legal and illegal are political, and often arbitrary, categorizations use and abuse are medical, or clinical, distinctions.</p><p>It is true that the aristocracies seem to have abused their monopoly of legal knowledge and at all events their exclusive possession of the law was a formidable impediment to the success of those popular movements which began to be universal in the western world.</p><p>I guess music, particularly the blues, is the only form of schizophrenia that has organised itself into being both legal and beneficial to society.</p><p>My job is to interpret the law based on how the legislature and the court has done it and then, of course, to use our system of justice to develop some new legal tools and new concepts.</p><p>We&#39;re involved right now in some very significant legal battles and it would be the wrong thing for me to do to step out in the middle of those battles.</p><p>I believe that President Clinton considered the legal merits of the arguments for the pardon as he understood them, and he rendered his judgment, wise or unwise, on the merits.</p><p>In my book, I detail the critical information we obtained from al Qaeda terrorists after they became compliant following a short period of enhanced interrogation. I have no doubt that that interrogation was legal, necessary and saved lives.</p><p>We knew that if the photos of CIA officers conducting authorized EIT (enhanced interrogation techniques) ever got out, the difference between a legal, authorized, necessary, and safe program and the mindless actions of some MPs (military police) would be buried by the impact of the images.</p><p>Drones can be a highly effective way of dealing with high-priority targets, but they should not become the drug of choice for an administration that is afraid to use successful, legal and safe tactics of the past.</p><p>People talk of me as being the inventor of the legal thriller.</p><p>I hope gay marriage will be legal in every state.</p><p>Companies shouldn&#39;t use the law to prevent consumers from doing something legal.</p><p>I object to a legal approach when settling questions of science or scientific behavior.</p><p>I&#39;m not a lawyer, and maybe I should have used more specific legal language.</p><p>I have a book coming out in September, for example, where the plot concerns counterfeiting, and I had to do a lot of research on that.

But if you know who you are and why you&#39;re there, all you need is the expertise and the information.</p><p>The right to a trial is a core principle of the American legal system. Depriving Americans of these essential liberties undermines the Constitution while doing nothing to strengthen our national security.</p><p>We need to be discussing issues specifically to help the American people.

But the rest of us have the right to question why they insist on doing so.</p><p>And books that were published in much larger numbers than Selfish, Little are hard to find.

Well, if you&#39;re game, the Duke Cunningham Legal Defense Fund is apparently ready to accept your donation.</p><p>Coercion may prevent many transgressions but it robs even actions which are legal of a part of their beauty.

If it means the kids go back home with them, that&#39;s what happens. If it means there are legal relatives in the United States that can take care of them, that can happen to.

They want all the benefits but none of the responsibilities.</p><p>Italy advocates the adoption of a legal instrument on cultural diversity, guaranteeing every country the protection of its own historical identity and the uniqueness of its physical and intangible cultural heritage.</p><p>I have a problem with censorship by the lawyer - by legal people by the publishing firm, and I may be changing publishers. They don&#39;t seem to want to take too many risks with living people.</p><p>Today, corruption has won and justice has lost. I brought corruption cases in good faith involving powerful people, and the political and legal establishment blatantly covered up and retaliated by targeting my law license.</p><p>We do not believe voters gave President Bush a mandate to turn back the clock decades on so many of our legal protections.</p><p>Even those who, like me, believe that Roe v. Wade and the decisions elaborating on reproductive rights were constitutionally correct must recognize that, for many on the right, the sudden and relatively sloppily reasoned character of the abortion rulings... did real damage to the Court&#39;s reputation as a relatively neutral arbiter of legal disputes.</p><p>Not a problem kid or anything like that so when you&#39;re in the legal system like that, it&#39;s always hard on a person for the first time to go through some things like that.</p><p>Daley may not feel a moral responsibility to eliminate discrimination but he has a legal obligation to do so.</p><p>The legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes, or altogether avoid them, by means which the law permits, cannot be doubted.</p><p>The president, just as any other American, deserves a legal defense against personal lawsuits not related to his office.

The whole problem started about 10 years ago with management and legal battles, then still trying to make albums while I was doing all of that.</p><p>We believe the use of force against Iraq, especially with reference to previous resolutions of the UN Security Council, has no grounds, including legal grounds.</p><p>By the fulfillment of my legal and moral duty I think I have earned punishment just as little as the tens of thousands of dutiful German officials who have now been imprisoned only because they carried out their duties.</p><p>Does the imam have a legal right to build the mosque at Ground Zero? The answer is yes. But is it the right thing to do? The answer is no.

Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one&#39;s definition of your life define yourself.</p><p>Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact.</p><p>Don&#39;t go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.</p><p>I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think, all the walks I want to take, all the books I want to read, and all the friends I want to see.</p><p>You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.</p><p>All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better.</p><p>Life is a dream for the wise, a game for the fool, a comedy for the rich, a tragedy for the poor.</p><p>Change is the law of life.

Live the life you have imagined.</p><p>A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.</p><p>Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don&#39;t resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.</p><p>My formula for living is quite simple. I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night. In between, I occupy myself as best I can.</p><p>Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.</p><p>I have a simple philosophy: Fill what&#39;s empty. Empty what&#39;s full. Scratch where it itches.</p><p>Any idiot can face a crisis - it&#39;s day to day living that wears you out.</p><p>The most important thing is to enjoy your life - to be happy - it&#39;s all that matters.</p><p>We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us.</p><p>Life&#39;s but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p><p>I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.</p><p>Change your life today. Don&#39;t gamble on the future, act now, without delay.</p><p>Every man dies. Not every man really lives.</p><p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p><p>If you love life, don&#39;t waste time, for time is what life is made up of.</p><p>A man sooner or later discovers that he is the master-gardener of his soul, the director of his life.</p><p>All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on.</p><p>Good friends, good books and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.</p><p>Our life always expresses the result of our dominant thoughts.</p><p>We need to give each other the space to grow, to be ourselves, to exercise our diversity.

I acted and behold, service was joy.</p><p>A person will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one part of his body - the wishbone.</p><p>There are three constants in life... change, choice and principles.</p><p>It&#39;s all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family.</p><p>Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.</p><p>My life is my message.</p><p>The true secret of happiness lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life.</p><p>I love those who yearn for the impossible.</p><p>I love life because what more is there?</p><p>I don&#39;t believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive.</p><p>Life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well.</p><p>Life loves the liver of it.</p><p>Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.</p><p>Once you say you&#39;re going to settle for second, that&#39;s what happens to you in life.</p><p>Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about.</p><p>The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy.</p><p>I do not regret one moment of my life.</p><p>Our life is what our thoughts make it.</p><p>Beware the barrenness of a busy life.</p><p>The shoe that fits one person pinches another there is no recipe for living that suits all cases.</p><p>Everything has been figured out, except how to live.</p><p>The only disability in life is a bad attitude.</p><p>If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.</p><p>Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies.</p><p>When life is too easy for us, we must beware or we may not be ready to meet the blows which sooner or later come to everyone, rich or poor.</p><p>I think I&#39;ve discovered the secret of life - you just hang around until you get used to it.</p><p>What we think determines what happens to us, so if we want to change our lives, we need to stretch our minds.</p><p>Doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life.</p><p>Everything in life is luck.</p><p>Use your health, even to the point of wearing it out. That is what it is for. Spend all you have before you die do not outlive yourself.</p><p>Life is a series of collisions with the future it is not the sum of what we have been, but what we yearn to be.</p><p>With the past, I have nothing to do nor with the future. I live now.</p><p>The story of life is quicker then the blink of an eye, the story of love is hello, goodbye.</p><p>Most people have never learned that one of the main aims in life is to enjoy it.</p><p>The aim of life is to live, and to live means to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware.</p><p>Life consists in what a man is thinking of all day.</p><p>Not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued.</p><p>Life becomes harder for us when we live for others, but it also becomes richer and happier.</p><p>A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.</p><p>I have found that if you love life, life will love you back.</p><p>May you live all the days of your life.</p><p>A healthful hunger for a great idea is the beauty and blessedness of life.</p><p>Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh.</p><p>To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.</p><p>Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.</p><p>The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.</p><p>Begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.</p><p>Look, I don&#39;t want to wax philosophic, but I will say that if you&#39;re alive you&#39;ve got to flap your arms and legs, you&#39;ve got to jump around a lot, for life is the very opposite of death, and therefore you must at very least think noisy and colorfully, or you&#39;re not alive.</p><p>When I hear somebody sigh, &#39;Life is hard,&#39; I am always tempted to ask, &#39;Compared to what?&#39;</p><p>People living deeply have no fear of death.</p><p>A well-spent day brings happy sleep.</p><p>Fortunately analysis is not the only way to resolve inner conflicts. Life itself still remains a very effective therapist.</p><p>Life in abundance comes only through great love.</p><p>The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes.</p><p>What is important in life is life, and not the result of life.</p><p>You have succeeded in life when all you really want is only what you really need.</p><p>An aim in life is the only fortune worth finding.</p><p>I look back on my life like a good day&#39;s work, it was done and I am satisfied with it.</p><p>While there&#39;s life, there&#39;s hope.</p><p>Get correct views of life, and learn to see the world in its true light. It will enable you to live pleasantly, to do good, and, when summoned away, to leave without regret.</p><p>Life is a long lesson in humility.</p><p>Life is half spent before we know what it is.</p><p>Life must be lived as play.</p><p>Maybe all one can do is hope to end up with the right regrets.</p><p>There is only one difference between a long life and a good dinner: that, in the dinner, the sweets come last.</p><p>One way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as an adventure.</p><p>Kindness, I&#39;ve discovered, is everything in life.</p><p>Unbeing dead isn&#39;t being alive.</p><p>To change ones life: Start immediately. Do it flamboyantly.</p><p>Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity, or registering wrongs.</p><p>This life is worth living, we can say, since it is what we make it.</p><p>Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It&#39;s the transition that&#39;s troublesome.</p><p>The purpose of life is a life of purpose.</p><p>We are all here for a spell, get all the good laughs you can.</p><p>The greatest pleasure of life is love.</p><p>The great use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.</p><p>Our business in life is not to succeed, but to continue to fail in good spirits.</p><p>The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.</p><p>While we are postponing, life speeds by.</p><p>There is just one life for each of us: our own.</p><p>The basic fact about human existence is not that it is a tragedy, but that it is a bore. It is not so much a war as an endless standing in line.</p><p>A chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and life is after all a chain.</p><p>Life is never easy for those who dream.</p><p>Life is too short to work so hard.</p><p>The chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions.</p><p>We are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from life.</p><p>For the happiest life, days should be rigorously planned, nights left open to chance.</p><p>Life well spent is long.</p><p>If you live long enough, you&#39;ll make mistakes. But if you learn from them, you&#39;ll be a better person. It&#39;s how you handle adversity, not how it affects you. The main thing is never quit, never quit, never quit.</p><p>Life is something to do when you can&#39;t get to sleep.</p><p>Life isn&#39;t a matter of milestones, but of moments.</p><p>We can&#39;t plan life. All we can do is be available for it.</p><p>Life will always be to a large extent what we ourselves make it.</p><p>Life is wasted on the living.</p><p>Life has meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself.</p><p>The art of life is to know how to enjoy a little and to endure very much.</p><p>The most exhausting thing in life is being insincere.</p><p>The main facts in human life are five: birth, food, sleep, love and death.</p><p>Life is a succession of moments, to live each one is to succeed.</p><p>There is no wealth but life.</p><p>Life is largely a matter of expectation.</p><p>Give me the luxuries of life and I will willingly do without the necessities.</p><p>The indispensable first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: decide what you want.</p><p>I take a simple view of life. It is keep your eyes open and get on with it.</p><p>Seventy percent of success in life is showing up.</p><p>Life is not an exact science, it is an art.</p><p>Every man regards his own life as the New Year&#39;s Eve of time.</p><p>To live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else.</p><p>What a wonderful life I&#39;ve had! I only wish I&#39;d realized it sooner.</p><p>Life is like a trumpet - if you don&#39;t put anything into it, you don&#39;t get anything out of it.</p><p>I take care of my flowers and my cats. And enjoy food. And that&#39;s living.</p><p>No man is a failure who is enjoying life.</p><p>The man who has no inner-life is a slave to his surroundings.</p><p>Wrong life cannot be lived rightly.</p><p>Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises.</p><p>Life is anything that dies when you stomp on it.</p><p>My life is every moment of my life. It is not a culmination of the past.</p><p>Life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act.</p><p>To me, if life boils down to one thing, it&#39;s movement. To live is to keep moving.</p><p>I did not direct my life. I didn&#39;t design it. I never made decisions. Things always came up and made them for me. That&#39;s what life is.</p><p>Human life is as evanescent as the morning dew or a flash of lightning.</p><p>To live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often.</p><p>Our entire life - consists ultimately in accepting ourselves as we are.</p><p>To know nothing is the happiest life.</p><p>To be free is to have achieved your life.</p><p>Variety&#39;s the very spice of life, That gives it all its flavor.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to be the Dalai Lama to tell people that life&#39;s about change.</p><p>Life is but thought.</p><p>Life itself is the proper binge.</p><p>The whole secret of life is to be interested in one thing profoundly and in a thousand things well.</p><p>Wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run. The daily work - that goes on, it adds up.</p><p>Life is a culmination of the past, an awareness of the present, an indication of a future beyond knowledge, the quality that gives a touch of divinity to matter.</p><p>The less routine the more life.</p><p>Life is much shorter than I imagined it to be.</p><p>Life ought to be a struggle of desire toward adventures whose nobility will fertilize the soul.</p><p>The Indian Summer of life should be a little sunny and a little sad, like the season, and infinite in wealth and depth of tone, but never hustled.</p><p>Any life is made up of a single moment, the moment in which a man finds out, once and for all, who he is.</p><p>What we play is life.</p><p>Life is a great sunrise. I do not see why death should not be an even greater one.</p><p>Life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.</p><p>Not a shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea that life is serious.</p><p>The fear of life is the favorite disease of the 20th century.</p><p>Life has a higher end, than to be amused.</p><p>The person lives twice who lives the first life well.</p><p>Unrest of spirit is a mark of life.</p><p>Life itself still remains a very effective therapist.</p><p>Life is a lot like jazz... it&#39;s best when you improvise.</p><p>I have inspiration and feelings of being alive most every day I live.</p><p>I had no blood relatives till I made some.</p><p>Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.</p><p>I believe that if life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade... And try to find somebody whose life has given them vodka, and have a party.</p><p>Where there is love there is life.</p><p>Life is one big road with lots of signs. So when you riding through the ruts, don&#39;t complicate your mind. Flee from hate, mischief and jealousy. Don&#39;t bury your thoughts, put your vision to reality. Wake Up and Live!</p><p>I&#39;ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I&#39;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&#39;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&#39;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</p><p>If you don&#39;t design your own life plan, chances are you&#39;ll fall into someone else&#39;s plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.</p><p>Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.</p><p>I hated every minute of training, but I said, &#39;Don&#39;t quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.&#39;</p><p>In everyone&#39;s life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit.</p><p>You have enemies? Good. That means you&#39;ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.</p><p>Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.</p><p>Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.</p><p>Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can&#39;t help them, at least don&#39;t hurt them.</p><p>Your time is limited, so don&#39;t waste it living someone else&#39;s life. Don&#39;t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people&#39;s thinking. Don&#39;t let the noise of others&#39; opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.</p><p>In the end, it&#39;s not the years in your life that count. It&#39;s the life in your years.</p><p>Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.</p><p>Choosing to be positive and having a grateful attitude is going to determine how you&#39;re going to live your life.</p><p>I&#39;ve failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.</p><p>Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.</p><p>Life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards.</p><p>My mother was the most beautiful woman I ever saw. All I am I owe to my mother. I attribute all my success in life to the moral, intellectual and physical education I received from her.</p><p>Character develops itself in the stream of life.</p><p>For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: &#39;If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?&#39; And whenever the answer has been &#39;No&#39; for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</p><p>I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn&#39;t, than live my life as if there isn&#39;t and die to find out there is.</p><p>But friendship is precious, not only in the shade, but in the sunshine of life, and thanks to a benevolent arrangement the greater part of life is sunshine.</p><p>Life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it.</p><p>I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, it&#39;s a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope. Which is what I do, and that enables you to laugh at life&#39;s realities.</p><p>Every moment and every event of every man&#39;s life on earth plants something in his soul.</p><p>Life&#39;s most persistent and urgent question is, &#39;What are you doing for others?&#39;</p><p>Imagine all the people living life in peace. You may say I&#39;m a dreamer, but I&#39;m not the only one. I hope someday you&#39;ll join us, and the world will be as one.</p><p>Life has its own hidden forces which you can only discover by living.</p><p>Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.</p><p>Whatever your life&#39;s work is, do it well. A man should do his job so well that the living, the dead, and the unborn could do it no better.</p><p>Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.</p><p>Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.</p><p>Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life&#39;s longing for itself. They came through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you.</p><p>Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.</p><p>All changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves we must die to one life before we can enter another.</p><p>All life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish, and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today.</p><p>If you can dream it, then you can achieve it. You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want.</p><p>No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we&#39;ll ever see on this earth!</p><p>I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Let&#39;s face it, friends make life a lot more fun.</p><p>To be idle is a short road to death and to be diligent is a way of life foolish people are idle, wise people are diligent.</p><p>Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life&#39;s coming attractions.</p><p>I&#39;m not going to change the way I look or the way I feel to conform to anything. I&#39;ve always been a freak. So I&#39;ve been a freak all my life and I have to live with that, you know. I&#39;m one of those people.</p><p>God gave us the gift of life it is up to us to give ourselves the gift of living well.</p><p>Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life.</p><p>Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome.</p><p>Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.</p><p>Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don&#39;t wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it&#39;s at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.</p><p>If you always put limit on everything you do, physical or anything else. It will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.</p><p>Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.</p><p>Bad things do happen how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness, immobilized by the gravity of my loss, or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I have - life itself.</p><p>The devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life. Either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat.</p><p>Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.</p><p>Again, you can&#39;t connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.</p><p>Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young.</p><p>When you rise in the morning, give thanks for the light, for your life, for your strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason to give thanks, the fault lies in yourself.</p><p>We love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving.</p><p>The quality, not the longevity, of one&#39;s life is what is important.</p><p>Without music, life would be a mistake.</p><p>I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best both for the body and the mind.</p><p>People fear death even more than pain. It&#39;s strange that they fear death. Life hurts a lot more than death. At the point of death, the pain is over. Yeah, I guess it is a friend.</p><p>Just as treasures are uncovered from the earth, so virtue appears from good deeds, and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind. To walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue.</p><p>Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us, but is always the result of a good conscience, good health, occupation, and freedom in all just pursuits.</p><p>I remember my mother&#39;s prayers and they have always followed me. They have clung to me all my life.</p><p>I&#39;ve learned that you shouldn&#39;t go through life with a catcher&#39;s mitt on both hands you need to be able to throw something back.</p><p>Of life&#39;s two chief prizes, beauty and truth, I found the first in a loving heart and the second in a laborer&#39;s hand.</p><p>You can&#39;t stop loving or wanting to love because when its right it&#39;s the best thing in the world. When you&#39;re in a relationship and its good, even if nothing else in your life is right, you feel like your whole world is complete.</p><p>The monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind.</p><p>Without deep reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people.</p><p>I love being married. It&#39;s so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life.</p><p>Property is intended to serve life, and no matter how much we surround it with rights and respect, it has no personal being. It is part of the earth man walks on. It is not man.</p><p>It&#39;s the game of life. Do I win or do I lose? One day they&#39;re gonna shut the game down. I gotta have as much fun and go around the board as many times as I can before it&#39;s my turn to leave.</p><p>Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life.</p><p>The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.</p><p>There is nothing more tragic than to find an individual bogged down in the length of life, devoid of breadth.</p><p>The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.</p><p>We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.</p><p>The only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows.</p><p>Today, more than ever before, life must be characterized by a sense of Universal responsibility, not only nation to nation and human to human, but also human to other forms of life.</p><p>Without health life is not life it is only a state of langour and suffering - an image of death.</p><p>He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.</p><p>When I was young I thought that money was the most important thing in life now that I am old I know that it is.</p><p>Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again.</p><p>The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.</p><p>In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don&#39;t try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.</p><p>If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with success unexpected in common hours.</p><p>Learning to trust is one of life&#39;s most difficult tasks.</p><p>Achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life, and that happiness, not pain or mindless self-indulgence, is the proof of your moral integrity, since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values.</p><p>The things that will destroy America are prosperity-at-any-price, peace-at-any-price, safety-first instead of duty-first, the love of soft living, and the get-rich-quick theory of life.</p><p>Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.</p><p>Don&#39;t Make Assumptions. Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.</p><p>Life is tough, but it&#39;s tougher when you&#39;re stupid.</p><p>A man who views the world the same at fifty as he did at twenty has wasted thirty years of his life.</p><p>Life&#39;s Tragedy is that we get old to soon and wise too late.</p><p>Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because it&#39;s only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.</p><p>You can&#39;t connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.</p><p>All the adversity I&#39;ve had in my life, all my troubles and obstacles, have strengthened me... You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you.</p><p>All my life I have tried to pluck a thistle and plant a flower wherever the flower would grow in thought and mind.</p><p>We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.</p><p>An armed society is a polite society. Manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life.</p><p>I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I&#39;m awake, you know?</p><p>The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own. You do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. You realize that you control your own destiny.</p><p>Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It&#39;s perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we&#39;ve learned something from yesterday.</p><p>Remembering that I&#39;ll be dead soon is the most important tool I&#39;ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.</p><p>And this, our life, exempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything.</p><p>Life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of eighty and gradually approach eighteen.</p><p>We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p>There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.</p><p>The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other&#39;s life.</p><p>So long as the memory of certain beloved friends lives in my heart, I shall say that life is good.</p><p>Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it.</p><p>To succeed in life, you need two things: ignorance and confidence.</p><p>You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help other people get what they want.</p><p>Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit.</p><p>My life has been one great big joke, a dance that&#39;s walked a song that&#39;s spoke, I laugh so hard I almost choke when I think about myself.</p><p>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven&#39;t found it yet, keep looking. Don&#39;t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you&#39;ll know when you find it.</p><p>There is only one thing in life worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.</p><p>Through humor, you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers. And once you find laughter, no matter how painful your situation might be, you can survive it.</p><p>The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you. If you do that, you&#39;re in control of your life. If you don&#39;t, life controls you.</p><p>All my life, my heart has yearned for a thing I cannot name.</p><p>If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough.</p><p>There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.</p><p>The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves.</p><p>What a wee little part of a person&#39;s life are his acts and his words! His real life is led in his head, and is known to none but himself.</p><p>Those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them for these only gave them life, those the art of living well.</p><p>Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams.</p><p>The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.</p><p>In our daily life, we encounter people who are angry, deceitful, intent only on satisfying their own needs. There is so much anger, distrust, greed, and pettiness that we are losing our capacity to work well together.</p><p>To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.</p><p>Our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself. Only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love God better because of them.</p><p>Make it a habit to tell people thank you. To express your appreciation, sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return. Truly appreciate those around you, and you&#39;ll soon find many others around you. Truly appreciate life, and you&#39;ll find that you have more of it.</p><p>Each person must live their life as a model for others.</p><p>I believe that being successful means having a balance of success stories across the many areas of your life. You can&#39;t truly be considered successful in your business life if your home life is in shambles.</p><p>True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.</p><p>There are four questions of value in life... What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same. Only love.</p><p>Money isn&#39;t the most important thing in life, but it&#39;s reasonably close to oxygen on the &#39;gotta have it&#39; scale.</p><p>I&#39;m the one that has to die when it&#39;s time for me to die, so let me live my life, the way I want to.</p><p>I decided, very early on, just to accept life unconditionally I never expected it to do anything special for me, yet I seemed to accomplish far more than I had ever hoped. Most of the time it just happened to me without my ever seeking it.</p><p>Life is a gamble. You can get hurt, but people die in plane crashes, lose their arms and legs in car accidents people die every day. Same with fighters: some die, some get hurt, some go on. You just don&#39;t let yourself believe it will happen to you.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe in guilt, I believe in living on impulse as long as you never intentionally hurt another person, and don&#39;t judge people in your life. I think you should live completely free.</p><p>You change your life by changing your heart.</p><p>Probably the happiest period in life most frequently is in middle age, when the eager passions of youth are cooled, and the infirmities of age not yet begun as we see that the shadows, which are at morning and evening so large, almost entirely disappear at midday.</p><p>I never thought of losing, but now that it&#39; s happened, the only thing is to do it right. That&#39;s my obligation to all the people who believe in me. We all have to take defeats in life.</p><p>Life stands before me like an eternal spring with new and brilliant clothes.</p><p>Life isn&#39;t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.</p><p>True friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils. Strive to have friends, for life without friends is like life on a desert island... to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune to keep him is a blessing.</p><p>The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only object of good government.</p><p>The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering.</p><p>My rule of life prescribed as an absolutely sacred rite smoking cigars and also the drinking of alcohol before, after and if need be during all meals and in the intervals between them.</p><p>Even when a person has all of life&#39;s comforts - good food, good shelter, a companion - he or she can still become unhappy when encountering a tragic situation.</p><p>March on. Do not tarry. To go forward is to move toward perfection. March on, and fear not the thorns, or the sharp stones on life&#39;s path.</p><p>You can never really live anyone else&#39;s life, not even your child&#39;s. The influence you exert is through your own life, and what you&#39;ve become yourself.</p><p>The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls.</p><p>The important thing is that men should have a purpose in life. It should be something useful, something good.</p><p>As you walk down the fairway of life you must smell the roses, for you only get to play one round.</p><p>Every man&#39;s life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.</p><p>If you ask me what I came into this life to do, I will tell you: I came to live out loud.</p><p>Part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside.</p><p>There&#39;s no tragedy in life like the death of a child. Things never get back to the way they were.</p><p>Some of the worst mistakes of my life have been haircuts.</p><p>Before success comes in any man&#39;s life, he&#39;s sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. That&#39;s exactly what the majority of men do.</p><p>You can change your world by changing your words... Remember, death and life are in the power of the tongue.</p><p>Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity.</p><p>Life is as tedious as twice-told tale, vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man.</p><p>A sense of humor... is needed armor. Joy in one&#39;s heart and some laughter on one&#39;s lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life.</p><p>The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time.</p><p>Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.</p><p>There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning.</p><p>Nothing is perfect. Life is messy. Relationships are complex. Outcomes are uncertain. People are irrational.</p><p>A nation which has forgotten the quality of courage which in the past has been brought to public life is not as likely to insist upon or regard that quality in its chosen leaders today - and in fact we have forgotten.</p><p>Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.</p><p>There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.</p><p>Literature adds to reality, it does not simply describe it. It enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides and in this respect, it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become.</p><p>If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life.</p><p>In the course of my life, I have often had to eat my words, and I must confess that I have always found it a wholesome diet.</p><p>Once I knew only darkness and stillness... my life was without past or future... but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living.</p><p>I am convinced that material things can contribute a lot to making one&#39;s life pleasant, but, basically, if you do not have very good friends and relatives who matter to you, life will be really empty and sad and material things cease to be important.</p><p>Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result.</p><p>Football is like life - it requires perseverance, self-denial, hard work, sacrifice, dedication and respect for authority.</p><p>For time and the world do not stand still. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future.</p><p>Life is either a great adventure or nothing.</p><p>Stop acting as if life is a rehearsal. Live this day as if it were your last. The past is over and gone. The future is not guaranteed.</p><p>Once in his life, every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead.</p><p>Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.</p><p>In war as in life, it is often necessary when some cherished scheme has failed, to take up the best alternative open, and if so, it is folly not to work for it with all your might.</p><p>Books constitute capital. A library book lasts as long as a house, for hundreds of years. It is not, then, an article of mere consumption but fairly of capital, and often in the case of professional men, setting out in life, it is their only capital.</p><p>The Christian life is not a constant high. I have my moments of deep discouragement. I have to go to God in prayer with tears in my eyes, and say, &#39;O God, forgive me,&#39; or &#39;Help me.&#39;</p><p>The ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival.</p><p>I guess I have always been deeply terrified to really be someone&#39;s wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really.</p><p>Life is never fair, and perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not.</p><p>People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built.</p><p>Without pain, there would be no suffering, without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes. To make it right, pain and suffering is the key to all windows, without it, there is no way of life.</p><p>If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.</p><p>Constant development is the law of life, and a man who always tries to maintain his dogmas in order to appear consistent drives himself into a false position.</p><p>Life is hard it&#39;s harder if you&#39;re stupid.</p><p>Let everyone try and find that as a result of daily prayer he adds something new to his life, something with which nothing can be compared.</p><p>No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don&#39;t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life&#39;s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.</p><p>It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power.</p><p>Truth is a deep kindness that teaches us to be content in our everyday life and share with the people the same happiness.</p><p>Holding on to anger, resentment and hurt only gives you tense muscles, a headache and a sore jaw from clenching your teeth. Forgiveness gives you back the laughter and the lightness in your life.</p><p>Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death.</p><p>Life is a series of experiences, each one of which makes us bigger, even though sometimes it is hard to realize this. For the world was built to develop character, and we must learn that the setbacks and grieves which we endure help us in our marching onward.</p><p>There is a very fine line between loving life and being greedy for it.</p><p>Life is one grand, sweet song, so start the music.</p><p>When we do the best that we can, we never know what miracle is wrought in our life, or in the life of another.</p><p>At fifteen life had taught me undeniably that surrender, in its place, was as honorable as resistance, especially if one had no choice.</p><p>One of the things I learned the hard way was that it doesn&#39;t pay to get discouraged. Keeping busy and making optimism a way of life can restore your faith in yourself.</p><p>As you simplify your life, the laws of the universe will be simpler solitude will not be solitude, poverty will not be poverty, nor weakness weakness.</p><p>Life loves to be taken by the lapel and told: &#39;I&#39;m with you kid. Let&#39;s go.&#39;</p><p>There are only three things women need in life: food, water, and compliments.</p><p>Life is an exciting business, and most exciting when it is lived for others.</p><p>I&#39;m not claiming divinity. I&#39;ve never claimed purity of soul. I&#39;ve never claimed to have the answers to life. I only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as I can... But I still believe in peace, love and understanding.</p><p>A life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things. There will be sleeping enough in the grave.</p><p>Each player must accept the cards life deals him or her: but once they are in hand, he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game.</p><p>We have one life it soon will be past what we do for God is all that will last.</p><p>Life is hard. After all, it kills you.</p><p>My philosophy of life is that if we make up our mind what we are going to make of our lives, then work hard toward that goal, we never lose - somehow we win out.</p><p>My favorite things in life don&#39;t cost any money. It&#39;s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.</p><p>A chief event of life is the day in which we have encountered a mind that startled us.</p><p>To deprive a man of his natural liberty and to deny to him the ordinary amenities of life is worse then starving the body it is starvation of the soul, the dweller in the body.</p><p>It was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.</p><p>My family, frankly, they weren&#39;t folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn&#39;t raise me in the church, so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.</p><p>Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself, and know that everything in life has purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences, all events are blessings given to us to learn from.</p><p>One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular.</p><p>The main purpose of life is to live rightly, think rightly, act rightly. The soul must languish when we give all our thought to the body.</p><p>At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, or a parent.</p><p>Life imitates art far more than art imitates Life.</p><p>Say there&#39;s a white kid who lives in a nice home, goes to an all-white school, and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me, because what that&#39;s saying is that he&#39;s living a fantasy life of rebellion.</p><p>I have spent many years of my life in opposition, and I rather like the role.</p><p>Freedom is never dear at any price. It is the breath of life. What would a man not pay for living?</p><p>Life every man holds dear but the dear man holds honor far more precious dear than life.</p><p>Alcohol is the anesthesia by which we endure the operation of life.</p><p>We have the duty to protect the life of an unborn child.</p><p>The greatest thing in family life is to take a hint when a hint is intended-and not to take a hint when a hint isn&#39;t intended.</p><p>You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love.</p><p>Religion is more than life. Remember that his own religion is the truest to every man even if it stands low in the scales of philosophical comparison.</p><p>Very little is needed to make a happy life it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.</p><p>The great danger for family life, in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure, comfort and independence, lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish.</p><p>There is more to life than increasing its speed.</p><p>Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the only proper basis for family life.</p><p>The world has grown suspicious of anything that looks like a happily married life.</p><p>I put all my genius into my life I put only my talent into my works.</p><p>There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathise with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life&#39;s sores the better.</p><p>I know in my heart that man is good. That what is right will always eventually triumph. And there&#39;s purpose and worth to each and every life.</p><p>Purity of personal life is the one indispensable condition for building up a sound education.</p><p>But what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads?</p><p>The man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.</p><p>The one charm about marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.</p><p>You do things when the opportunities come along. I&#39;ve had periods in my life when I&#39;ve had a bundle of ideas come along, and I&#39;ve had long dry spells. If I get an idea next week, I&#39;ll do something. If not, I won&#39;t do a damn thing.</p><p>Presents don&#39;t really mean much to me. I don&#39;t want to sound mawkish, but - it was the realization that I have a great many people in my life who really love me, and who I really love.</p><p>I&#39;m so glad I never feel important, it does complicate life!</p><p>One&#39;s real life is so often the life that one does not lead.</p><p>Education is not preparation for life education is life itself.</p><p>Life must be lived and curiosity kept alive. One must never, for whatever reason, turn his back on life.</p><p>I bear a charmed life.</p><p>Man does not control his own fate. The women in his life do that for him.</p><p>I haven&#39;t trusted polls since I read that 62% of women had affairs during their lunch hour. I&#39;ve never met a woman in my life who would give up lunch for sex.</p><p>In married life three is company and two none.</p><p>Life is pretty simple: You do some stuff. Most fails. Some works. You do more of what works. If it works big, others quickly copy it. Then you do something else. The trick is the doing something else.</p><p>Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country.</p><p>A man who has never made a woman angry is a failure in life.</p><p>Autobiographies are only useful as the lives you read about and analyze may suggest to you something that you may find useful in your own journey through life.</p><p>In modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude. It makes the whole world kin.</p><p>The greatest day in your life and mine is when we take total responsibility for our attitudes. That&#39;s the day we truly grow up.</p><p>For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.</p><p>It is one of the beautiful compensations in this life that no one can sincerely try to help another without helping himself.</p><p>In poverty and other misfortunes of life, true friends are a sure refuge. The young they keep out of mischief to the old they are a comfort and aid in their weakness, and those in the prime of life they incite to noble deeds.</p><p>I am a woman in process. I&#39;m just trying like everybody else. I try to take every conflict, every experience, and learn from it. Life is never dull.</p><p>When you have nobody you can make a cup of tea for, when nobody needs you, that&#39;s when I think life is over.</p><p>If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.</p><p>Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of.</p><p>Your daily life is your temple and your religion. When you enter into it take with you your all.</p><p>You have to take risks. We will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen.</p><p>Frazier is so ugly that he should donate his face to the US Bureau of Wild Life.</p><p>If anyone is crazy enough to want to kill a president of the United States, he can do it. All he must be prepared to do is give his life for the president&#39;s.</p><p>He who is not everyday conquering some fear has not learned the secret of life.</p><p>The greatest gift of life is friendship, and I have received it.</p><p>Life is without meaning. You bring the meaning to it. The meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be. Being alive is the meaning.</p><p>The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty, and all forms of human life.</p><p>Life is hard. Then you die. Then they throw dirt in your face. Then the worms eat you. Be grateful it happens in that order.</p><p>Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging.</p><p>I am sorry to say that there is too much point to the wisecrack that life is extinct on other planets because their scientists were more advanced than ours.</p><p>The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?</p><p>There is always inequality in life. Some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded and some men never leave the country. Life is unfair.</p><p>I really haven&#39;t had that exciting of a life. There are a lot of things I wish I would have done, instead of just sitting around and complaining about having a boring life. So I pretty much like to make it up. I&#39;d rather tell a story about somebody else.</p><p>Choose your life&#39;s mate carefully. From this one decision will come 90 percent of all your happiness or misery.</p><p>Many of life&#39;s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.</p><p>Success comes from taking the initiative and following up... persisting... eloquently expressing the depth of your love. What simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life?</p><p>I want to live my life so that my nights are not full of regrets.</p><p>Don&#39;t be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment.</p><p>This is the strangest life I&#39;ve ever known.</p><p>The wise man does not expose himself needlessly to danger, since there are few things for which he cares sufficiently but he is willing, in great crises, to give even his life - knowing that under certain conditions it is not worthwhile to live.</p><p>I swear, by my life and my love of it, that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.</p><p>Your life is the fruit of your own doing. You have no one to blame but yourself.</p><p>Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!</p><p>Life is thickly sown with thorns, and I know no other remedy than to pass quickly through them. The longer we dwell on our misfortunes, the greater is their power to harm us.</p><p>I have learned, that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.</p><p>When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, &#39;Why god? Why me?&#39; and the thundering voice of God answered, &#39;There&#39;s just something about you that pisses me off.&#39;</p><p>All the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination, Imagination is the workshop of your mind, capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth.</p><p>The quality of a person&#39;s life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavor.</p><p>Are you bored with life? Then throw yourself into some work you believe in with all your heart, live for it, die for it, and you will find happiness that you had thought could never be yours.</p><p>Old age is just a record of one&#39;s whole life.</p><p>The more sand has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it.</p><p>Death and life have their determined appointments riches and honors depend upon heaven.</p><p>A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer, and shall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams.</p><p>To be able to look back upon ones life in satisfaction, is to live twice.</p><p>An Atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church. An atheist believes that deed must be done instead of prayer said. An atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death. He wants disease conquered, poverty vanished, war eliminated.</p><p>You want to believe that there&#39;s one relationship in life that&#39;s beyond betrayal. A relationship that&#39;s beyond that kind of hurt. And there isn&#39;t.</p><p>I need drama in my life to keep making music.</p><p>I should have no objection to go over the same life from its beginning to the end: requesting only the advantage authors have, of correcting in a second edition the faults of the first.</p><p>One thing they never tell you about child raising is that for the rest of your life, at the drop of a hat, you are expected to know your child&#39;s name and how old he or she is.</p><p>There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them.</p><p>The ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace, making the best of circumstances.</p><p>Friendship is the shadow of the evening, which increases with the setting sun of life.</p><p>To lengthen thy life, lessen thy meals.</p><p>Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.</p><p>Life without liberty is like a body without spirit.</p><p>You may not always have a comfortable life and you will not always be able to solve all of the world&#39;s problems at once but don&#39;t ever underestimate the importance you can have because history has shown us that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own.</p><p>Have courage for the great sorrows of life and patience for the small ones and when you have laboriously accomplished your daily task, go to sleep in peace.</p><p>The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you&#39;ve got it made.</p><p>Be true to the game, because the game will be true to you. If you try to shortcut the game, then the game will shortcut you. If you put forth the effort, good things will be bestowed upon you.

He inspires everything in my life and enables me to do the best that I can.

You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups, get medical information, the latest experimental drugs. These things can profoundly influence life. I&#39;m not downplaying that.</p><p>Life is very interesting... in the end, some of your greatest pains, become your greatest strengths.</p><p>Today is life-the only life you are sure of. Make the most of today. Get interested in something. Shake yourself awake. Develop a hobby. Let the winds of enthusiasm sweep through you.

She&#39;s instilled in me a toughness and a perseverance and just a never-quit mentality, and I thank her every day for providing me, for what she sacrificed her life for.</p><p>How do you go from where you are to where you wanna be? And I think you have to have an enthusiasm for life. You have to have a dream, a goal. And you have to be willing to work for it.</p><p>The real test of friendship is: can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple?</p><p>The most glorious moments in your life are not the so-called days of success, but rather those days when out of dejection and despair you feel rise in you a challenge to life, and the promise of future accomplishments.</p><p>You come to a point in your life when you really don&#39;t care what people think about you, you just care what you think about yourself.</p><p>A well-developed sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life.</p><p>I&#39;ve been absolutely terrified every moment of my life - and I&#39;ve never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do.</p><p>Do the best you can, and don&#39;t take life too serious.</p><p>We only live once, but once is enough if we do it right. Live your life with class, dignity, and style so that an exclamation, rather than a question mark signifies it!</p><p>Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves.</p><p>I actually thought that it would be a little confusing during the same period of your life to be in one meeting when you&#39;re trying to make money, and then go to another meeting where you&#39;re giving it away. I mean is it gonna erode your ability, you know, to make money?

Life is too short to be vengeful or malicious.</p><p>I haven&#39;t lived a perfect life. I have regrets. But that&#39;s from a lifetime of taking chances, making decisions, and trying not to be frozen. The only thing that I can do with my regrets is understand them.</p><p>The value of life lies not in the length of days, but in the use we make of them...

It&#39;s like riding a bicycle or typing. If you&#39;re willing to work at it, you can rapidly improve the quality of evry part of your life.</p><p>Life lived for tomorrow will always be just a day away from being realized.</p><p>I never did a day&#39;s work in my life. It was all fun.</p><p>Let love flow so that it cleanses the world. Then man can live in peace, instead of the state of turmoil he has created through his past ways of life, with all those material interests and earthly ambitions.</p><p>Sometimes it&#39;s the smallest decisions that can change your life forever.</p><p>There is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will truly have defeated age.</p><p>Life is just one damned thing after another.</p><p>That&#39;s the way I got along in life. I don&#39;t ever remember being particularly jealous of anybody, because I figured if I can&#39;t do it myself, I don&#39;t deserve to get it.</p><p>Love, we say, is life but love without hope and faith is agonizing death.</p><p>The happiness of this life depends less on what befalls you than the way in which you take it.</p><p>It is possible to become discouraged about the injustice we see everywhere. But God did not promise us that the world would be humane and just. He gives us the gift of life and allows us to choose the way we will use our limited time on earth. It is an awesome opportunity.</p><p>And by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.</p><p>Man is subject to innumerable pains and sorrows by the very condition of humanity, and yet, as if nature had not sown evils enough in life, we are continually adding grief to grief and aggravating the common calamity by our cruel treatment of one another.</p><p>Television is not real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.</p><p>To expect too much is to have a sentimental view of life and this is a softness that ends in bitterness.</p><p>We have to be able to grow up. Our wrinkles are our medals of the passage of life. They are what we have been through and who we want to be.</p><p>Polygamy: An endeavour to get more out of life than there is in it.</p><p>What material success does is provide you with the ability to concentrate on other things that really matter. And that is being able to make a difference, not only in your own life, but in other people&#39;s lives.</p><p>My Alma mater was books, a good library... I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity.</p><p>Live by this credo: have a little laugh at life and look around you for happiness instead of sadness. Laughter has always brought me out of unhappy situations.</p><p>It&#39;s not the men in my life that count, it&#39;s the life in my men.</p><p>Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what&#39;s going to happen next.</p><p>What they&#39;re not ready for is guys like you and I and Nails and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life, that we are high priests, Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.</p><p>I blame my mother for my poor sex life. All she told me was &#39;the man goes on top and the woman underneath.&#39; For three years my husband and I slept in bunk beds.</p><p>Imagination and fiction make up more than three quarters of our real life.</p><p>Sleep - the most beautiful experience in life - except drink.</p><p>Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.</p><p>Be strong, believe in freedom and in God, love yourself, understand your sexuality, have a sense of humor, masturbate, don&#39;t judge people by their religion, color or sexual habits, love life and your family.</p><p>For if there is a sin against life, it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life.</p><p>As a remedy to life in society I would suggest the big city. Nowadays, it is the only desert within our means.</p><p>It is normal to give away a little of one&#39;s life in order not to lose it all.</p><p>I&#39;ve always taken &#39;The Wizard of Oz&#39; very seriously, you know. I believe in the idea of the rainbow. And I&#39;ve spent my entire life trying to get over it.</p><p>The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen but, if one will, are to be lived.</p><p>There are moments in life, when the heart is so full of emotion That if by chance it be shaken, or into its depths like a pebble Drops some careless word, it overflows, and its secret, Spilt on the ground like water, can never be gathered together.</p><p>It&#39;s funny the way most people love the dead. Once you are dead, you are made for life.</p><p>Life takes its path and sometimes there are people to blame. Of course there are bad people in this world. Good, bad, it happens unfortunately. But in a way I think if there was more focus on the good, more good would happen.</p><p>Life all comes down to a few moments. This is one of them.</p><p>The joy of life consists in the exercise of one&#39;s energies, continual growth, constant change, the enjoyment of every new experience. To stop means simply to die. The eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal.</p><p>One&#39;s family is the most important thing in life. I look at it this way: One of these days I&#39;ll be over in a hospital somewhere with four walls around me. And the only people who&#39;ll be with me will be my family.</p><p>The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future in life.</p><p>I like people that enjoy life, &#39;cause I do the same.</p><p>For God so loved the World that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</p><p>So if you stay ready, you ain&#39;t gotta get ready, and that is how I run my life.</p><p>Life is too short to spend hoping that the perfectly arched eyebrow or hottest new lip shade will mask an ugly heart.</p><p>We don&#39;t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? So this is what we&#39;ve chosen to do with our life.</p><p>If I had to choose a religion, the sun as the universal giver of life would be my god.</p><p>Life is made up, not of great sacrifices or duties, but of little things, in which smiles and kindness, and small obligations given habitually, are what preserve the heart and secure comfort.</p><p>There has never yet been a man in our history who led a life of ease whose name is worth remembering.</p><p>I just got one last thing, I urge all of you, all of you, to enjoy your life, the precious moments you have. To spend each day with some laughter and some thought, to get you&#39;re emotions going.</p><p>Do what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether it&#39;s business or baseball, or the theater, or any field. If you don&#39;t love what you&#39;re doing and you can&#39;t give it your best, get out of it. Life is too short. You&#39;ll be an old man before you know it.</p><p>I don&#39;t think you ever stop giving. I really don&#39;t. I think it&#39;s an on-going process. And it&#39;s not just about being able to write a check. It&#39;s being able to touch somebody&#39;s life.</p><p>Faith is the first factor in a life devoted to service. Without it, nothing is possible. With it, nothing is impossible.</p><p>My goal is to be one with the music. I just dedicate my whole life to this art.</p><p>A life lived with integrity - even if it lacks the trappings of fame and fortune is a shining star in whose light others may follow in the years to come.</p><p>If a man can bridge the gap between life and death, if he can live on after he&#39;s dead, then maybe he was a great man.</p><p>I like the idea of being alone. I like the idea of often being alone in all aspects of my life. I like to feel lonely. I like to need things.</p><p>Life is what we make it, always has been, always will be.</p><p>For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person&#39;s life at a given moment.</p><p>One&#39;s life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion.</p><p>I&#39;m at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life. In fact, I&#39;ve just had a mirror put over my kitchen table.</p><p>If I have any worth, it is to live my life for God so as to teach these peoples even though some of them still look down on me.</p><p>Life could be wonderful if people would leave you alone.</p><p>I really believe that everyone has a talent, ability, or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life.</p><p>I lost my sense of trust, honesty and compassion. I crashed down and became what I consider an emotional mess. I&#39;ve never been so miserable in my whole life. I just wanted to go to bed and never get up.</p><p>I have found it easier to identify with the characters who verge upon hysteria, who were frightened of life, who were desperate to reach out to another person. But these seemingly fragile people are the strong people really.</p><p>Life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives.</p><p>I have been up against tough competition all my life. I wouldn&#39;t know how to get along without it.</p><p>Life is all memory, except for the one present moment that goes by you so quickly you hardly catch it going.</p><p>I have a lot of things to prove to myself. One is that I can live my life fearlessly.</p><p>You make mistakes, but I don&#39;t have any regrets. I&#39;m the kind of person who takes responsibility for it and deals with it. I learn from everything I do. I work very hard, I have so many things going on in my life. Get to know me and see who I am.</p><p>Photography takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still.</p><p>Life&#39;s pretty good, and why wouldn&#39;t it be? I&#39;m a pirate, after all.</p><p>Sorrow is knowledge, those that know the most must mourn the deepest, the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life.</p><p>Creativity is a great motivator because it makes people interested in what they are doing. Creativity gives hope that there can be a worthwhile idea. Creativity gives the possibility of some sort of achievement to everyone. Creativity makes life more fun and more interesting.</p><p>Gratitude helps you to grow and expand gratitude brings joy and laughter into your life and into the lives of all those around you.</p><p>If I were to say, &#39;God, why me?&#39; about the bad things, then I should have said, &#39;God, why me?&#39; about the good things that happened in my life.</p><p>Music is love, love is music, music is life, and I love my life. Thank you and good night.</p><p>I was set free because my greatest fear had been realized, and I still had a daughter who I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn&#39;t be ours anymore.</p><p>Words can never adequately convey the incredible impact of our attitudes toward life. The longer I live the more convinced I become that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it.</p><p>I&#39;ll always stay connected with Apple. I hope that throughout my life I&#39;ll sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like a tapestry. There may be a few years when I&#39;m not there, but I&#39;ll always come back.</p><p>Friends are as companions on a journey, who ought to aid each other to persevere in the road to a happier life.</p><p>The first thing which I can record concerning myself is, that I was born. These are wonderful words. This life, to which neither time nor eternity can bring diminution - this everlasting living soul, began. My mind loses itself in these depths.</p><p>Take control of your consistent emotions and begin to consciously and deliberately reshape your daily experience of life.</p><p>When it comes to life the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude.</p><p>He who is void of virtuous attachments in private life is, or very soon will be, void of all regard for his country. There is seldom an instance of a man guilty of betraying his country, who had not before lost the feeling of moral obligations in his private connections.</p><p>Sometimes, I feel like one who is on the sidelines, who has missed life itself.</p><p>Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.</p><p>Life is to be entered upon with courage.</p><p>Difficult times have helped me to understand better than before, how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way, and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever.</p><p>Haters never win. I just think that&#39;s true about life, because negative energy always costs in the end.</p><p>In life you need either inspiration or desperation.</p><p>They tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice... that suicide is wrong when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.</p><p>Your problem is how you are going to spend this one odd and precious life you have been issued. Whether you&#39;re going to spend it trying to look good and creating the illusion that you have power over people and circumstances, or whether you are going to taste it, enjoy it and find out the truth about who you are.</p><p>You can&#39;t make positive choices for the rest of your life without an environment that makes those choices easy, natural, and enjoyable.</p><p>Woz is living his own life now. He hasn&#39;t been around Apple for about five years. But what he did will go down in history.</p><p>Half our life is spent trying to find something to do with the time we have rushed through life trying to save.</p><p>Choice of attention - to pay attention to this and ignore that - is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer. In both cases, a man is responsible for his choice and must accept the consequences, whatever they may be.</p><p>It is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all one&#39;s life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than &#39;try to be a little kinder.&#39;</p><p>I think togetherness is a very important ingredient to family life.</p><p>Sometimes you trust someone who turns out not to be honest. There are a lot of things that happen in life that don&#39;t turn out the way you&#39;re given the impression that they will. And I think that&#39;s all kind of a con. But I think we&#39;ve probably all been hurt.</p><p>My guiding principles in life are to be honest, genuine, thoughtful and caring.</p><p>Be thou the rainbow in the storms of life. The evening beam that smiles the clouds away, and tints tomorrow with prophetic ray.</p><p>I do not believe in excuses. I believe in hard work as the prime solvent of life&#39;s problems.</p><p>I made a mistake by being ejected from the presidency. Next time, I will choose a Cabinet which will allow me to be life President.</p><p>Life is too short to worry about anything. You had better enjoy it because the next day promises nothing.</p><p>The personal life deeply lived always expands into truths beyond itself.</p><p>You must pass your days in song. Let your whole life be a song.</p><p>A bachelor&#39;s life is a fine breakfast, a flat lunch, and a miserable dinner.</p><p>If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life. With confidence, you have won even before you have started.</p><p>You know what your problem is, it&#39;s that you haven&#39;t seen enough movies - all of life&#39;s riddles are answered in the movies.</p><p>Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.</p><p>You were made by God and for God, and until you understand that, life will never make sense.</p><p>Life is essentially a cheat and its conditions are those of defeat the redeeming things are not happiness and pleasure but the deeper satisfactions that come out of struggle.</p><p>My general attitude to life is to enjoy every minute of every day. I never do anything with a feeling of, &#39;Oh God, I&#39;ve got to do this today.&#39;</p><p>When you do the common things in life in an uncommon way, you will command the attention of the world.</p><p>Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life is impossible.</p><p>My focus is to forget the pain of life. Forget the pain, mock the pain, reduce it. And laugh.</p><p>Life is lived on the edge.</p><p>Life opens up opportunities to you, and you either take them or you stay afraid of taking them.</p><p>Part of the happiness of life consists not in fighting battles, but in avoiding them. A masterly retreat is in itself a victory.</p><p>Never build your emotional life on the weaknesses of others.</p><p>Justice in the life and conduct of the State is possible only as first it resides in the hearts and souls of the citizens.</p><p>A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won&#39;t be too bad.</p><p>You are doomed to make choices. This is life&#39;s greatest paradox.</p><p>I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life.</p><p>You use your money to buy privacy because during most of your life you aren&#39;t allowed to be normal.</p><p>I lead no party I follow no leader. I have given the best part of my life to careful study of Islam, its law and polity, its culture, its history and its literature.</p><p>We must declare ourselves, become known allow the world to discover this subterranean life of ours which connects kings and farm boys, artists and clerks. Let them see that the important thing is not the object of love, but the emotion itself.</p><p>Faith means living with uncertainty - feeling your way through life, letting your heart guide you like a lantern in the dark.</p><p>You see, in life, lots of people know what to do, but few people actually do what they know. Knowing is not enough! You must take action.</p><p>Life is not an easy matter... You cannot live through it without falling into frustration and cynicism unless you have before you a great idea which raises you above personal misery, above weakness, above all kinds of perfidy and baseness.</p><p>I have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream, when I lock into someone or something, you can&#39;t get me away from it because I commit that thoroughly. That&#39;s in friendship, that&#39;s a deal, that&#39;s a commitment. Don&#39;t give me paper - I can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it. But if you shake my hand, that&#39;s for life.</p><p>Find ecstasy in life the mere sense of living is joy enough.</p><p>You hear a lot about God these days: God, the beneficent God, the all-great God, the Almighty God, the most powerful God, the giver of life God, the creator of death. I mean, we&#39;re hearing about God all the time, so we better learn how to deal with it. But if we know anything about God, God is arbitrary.</p><p>Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.</p><p>Just when I think I have learned the way to live, life changes.</p><p>I remember a specific moment, watching my grandmother hang the clothes on the line, and her saying to me, &#39;you are going to have to learn to do this,&#39; and me being in that space of awareness and knowing that my life would not be the same as my grandmother&#39;s life.</p><p>When life knocks you down, try to land on your back. Because if you can look up, you can get up. Let your reason get you back up.</p><p>A lot of us grow up and we grow out of the literal interpretation that we get when we&#39;re children, but we bear the scars all our life. Whether they&#39;re scars of beauty or scars of ugliness, it&#39;s pretty much in the eye of the beholder.</p><p>In the last analysis, the individual person is responsible for living his own life and for &#39;finding himself.&#39; If he persists in shifting his responsibility to somebody else, he fails to find out the meaning of his own existence.</p><p>Every life has a measure of sorrow, and sometimes this is what awakens us.</p><p>It&#39;s surprising how many persons go through life without ever recognizing that their feelings toward other people are largely determined by their feelings toward themselves, and if you&#39;re not comfortable within yourself, you can&#39;t be comfortable with others.</p><p>My philosophy is that not only are you responsible for your life, but doing the best at this moment puts you I the best place for the next moment.</p><p>People have a moral standard about what they will do and will not do. At the end of the day someone who cheats has a lower moral standard than someone who does not. And they will cheat in other areas of life as well.</p><p>The tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives - the death of genuine feeling, the death of inspired response, the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself.</p><p>A man who has been the indisputable favorite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror.</p><p>Having Down syndrome is like being born normal. I am just like you and you are just like me. We are all born in different ways, that is the way I can describe it. I have a normal life.</p><p>Saving faith is an immediate relation to Christ, accepting, receiving, resting upon Him alone, for justification, sanctification, and eternal life by virtue of God&#39;s grace.</p><p>Cease trying to work everything out with your minds. It will get you nowhere. Live by intuition and inspiration and let your whole life be Revelation.</p><p>If you wish to succeed in life, make perseverance your bosom friend, experience your wise counselor, caution your elder brother, and hope your guardian genius.</p><p>I haven&#39;t understood a bar of music in my life, but I have felt it.</p><p>This is the highest wisdom that I own freedom and life are earned by those alone who conquer them each day anew.</p><p>Not by appointment do we meet delight Or joy they heed not our expectancy But round some corner of the streets of life they of a sudden greet us with a smile.</p><p>The meaning of life is contained in every single expression of life. It is present in the infinity of forms and phenomena that exist in all of creation.</p><p>The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence.</p><p>Millions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life.

But in the endgame of life, I fundamentally believe the key to happiness is letting go of that idea of perfection.</p><p>Being taken for granted can be a compliment. It means that you&#39;ve become a comfortable, trusted element in another person&#39;s life.</p><p>The more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it.</p><p>Our heavenly Father understands our disappointment, suffering, pain, fear, and doubt.

A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.</p><p>Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel. Or, not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them.

It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul.</p><p>A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.</p><p>Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love.</p><p>A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot live without love.</p><p>If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you.</p><p>Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.</p><p>Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do... but how much love we put in that action.</p><p>Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war love is a growing up.</p><p>Can miles truly separate you from friends... If you want to be with someone you love, aren&#39;t you already there?</p><p>A woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea.</p><p>A man is already halfway in love with any woman who listens to him.</p><p>Love is a force more formidable than any other.

You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.</p><p>We love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving.</p><p>Love is a better teacher than duty.</p><p>Come live in my heart, and pay no rent.</p><p>Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We don&#39;t love to be loved we love to love.</p><p>Love is like war: easy to begin but very hard to stop.</p><p>If you press me to say why I loved him, I can say no more than because he was he, and I was I.</p><p>The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread.</p><p>Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life.</p><p>The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.</p><p>What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us.</p><p>As soon go kindle fire with snow, as seek to quench the fire of love with words.</p><p>Faith makes all things possible... love makes all things easy.</p><p>Friendship often ends in love but love in friendship - never.</p><p>A very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love.</p><p>Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky.</p><p>The best proof of love is trust.</p><p>A part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve.</p><p>Love isn&#39;t something you find.

When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies.</p><p>Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.</p><p>When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace.</p><p>You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection.</p><p>Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.</p><p>A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person.</p><p>Spread love everywhere you go.

This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.</p><p>To love beauty is to see light.</p><p>There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.</p><p>My great hope is to laugh as much as I cry to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return.</p><p>It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.</p><p>Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them humanity cannot survive.</p><p>Don&#39;t aim for success if you want it just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally.</p><p>It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. This is how the whole scheme of things works. All good things are difficult to achieve and bad things are very easy to get.</p><p>I love people who make me laugh. I honestly think it&#39;s the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It&#39;s probably the most important thing in a person.</p><p>When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.</p><p>The love of family and the admiration of friends is much more important than wealth and privilege.</p><p>Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.</p><p>There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love.</p><p>Love begins by taking care of the closest ones - the ones at home.</p><p>If music be the food of love, play on.</p><p>Never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you: love, prayer, and forgiveness.</p><p>If you have only one smile in you give it to the people you love.</p><p>Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend.</p><p>Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies - or else? The chain reaction of evil - hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars - must be broken, or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.</p><p>Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love this is the eternal rule.</p><p>All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn&#39;t hurt.</p><p>Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude.</p><p>I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. &#39;Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death.</p><p>If you love life, don&#39;t waste time, for time is what life is made up of.</p><p>Before marriage, a girl has to make love to a man to hold him. After marriage, she has to hold him to make love to him.</p><p>It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that&#39;s pretty important.</p><p>At the center of non-violence stands the principle of love.</p><p>Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope.</p><p>Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness.</p><p>Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship.</p><p>Let us more and more insist on raising funds of love, of kindness, of understanding, of peace. Money will come if we seek first the Kingdom of God - the rest will be given.</p><p>Let us not be satisfied with just giving money. Money is not enough, money can be got, but they need your hearts to love them. So, spread your love everywhere you go.</p><p>You can&#39;t stop loving or wanting to love because when its right it&#39;s the best thing in the world. When you&#39;re in a relationship and its good, even if nothing else in your life is right, you feel like your whole world is complete.</p><p>A coward is incapable of exhibiting love it is the prerogative of the brave.</p><p>You can&#39;t blame gravity for falling in love.</p><p>Never trust anyone completely but God. Love people, but put your full trust only in God.</p><p>If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they&#39;re yours if they don&#39;t they never were.</p><p>I love being married. It&#39;s so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life.</p><p>If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. And if they don&#39;t, they never were.</p><p>I love you when you bow in your mosque, kneel in your temple, pray in your church.

It is quiet understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses.</p><p>If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.</p><p>Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own... Jealousy is a disease, love is a healthy condition. The immature mind often mistakes one for the other, or assumes that the greater the love, the greater the jealousy.</p><p>Intense love does not measure, it just gives.</p><p>But let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.</p><p>Even the rich are hungry for love, for being cared for, for being wanted, for having someone to call their own.</p><p>Love is a fruit in season at all times, and within reach of every hand.</p><p>I love mirrors. They let one pass through the surface of things.</p><p>Be Impeccable With Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.</p><p>The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them.</p><p>If we listened to our intellect, we&#39;d never have a love affair. We&#39;d never have a friendship. We&#39;d never go into business, because we&#39;d be cynical. Well, that&#39;s nonsense. You&#39;ve got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down.</p><p>Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.</p><p>Anyway, no drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of society. If we&#39;re looking for the source of our troubles, we shouldn&#39;t test people for drugs, we should test them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and love of power.</p><p>The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.</p><p>And ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.</p><p>The things that will destroy America are prosperity-at-any-price, peace-at-any-price, safety-first instead of duty-first, the love of soft living, and the get-rich-quick theory of life.</p><p>Absence from those we love is self from self - a deadly banishment.</p><p>Love of beauty is taste. The creation of beauty is art.</p><p>I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.</p><p>Love is the ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves without any insistence that they satisfy you.</p><p>Men always want to be a woman&#39;s first love - women like to be a man&#39;s last romance.</p><p>Love is like a beautiful flower which I may not touch, but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same.</p><p>I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I&#39;m awake, you know?</p><p>If we lose love and self respect for each other, this is how we finally die.</p><p>There is always the danger that we may just do the work for the sake of the work.

That is the reason one should never marry.</p><p>We&#39;ve got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You can&#39;t just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it&#39;s going to get on by itself. You&#39;ve got to keep watering it. You&#39;ve got to really look after it and nurture it.</p><p>A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.</p><p>The greatest gift that you can give to others is the gift of unconditional love and acceptance.</p><p>Many people mistake our work for our vocation. Our vocation is the love of Jesus.</p><p>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven&#39;t found it yet, keep looking. Don&#39;t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you&#39;ll know when you find it.</p><p>Forgiveness is the final form of love.</p><p>The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother.</p><p>Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls.</p><p>I try to give to the poor people for love what the rich could get for money. No, I wouldn&#39;t touch a leper for a thousand pounds yet I willingly cure him for the love of God.</p><p>If someone thinks that love and peace is a cliche that must have been left behind in the Sixties, that&#39;s his problem. Love and peace are eternal.</p><p>The first duty of love is to listen.</p><p>I see when men love women. They give them but a little of their lives. But women when they love give everything.</p><p>Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.</p><p>Our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself. Only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love God better because of them.</p><p>There are four questions of value in life... What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same. Only love.</p><p>Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer.</p><p>Power is of two kinds. One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived from fear of punishment.</p><p>We are not the same persons this year as last nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person.</p><p>God proved His love on the Cross. When Christ hung, and bled, and died, it was God saying to the world, &#39;I love you.&#39;</p><p>Falling in love and having a relationship are two different things.</p><p>Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.</p><p>Trust is to human relationships what faith is to gospel living. It is the beginning place, the foundation upon which more can be built. Where trust is, love can flourish.</p><p>As selfishness and complaint pervert the mind, so love with its joy clears and sharpens the vision.</p><p>When you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain.</p><p>I love deadlines.

It can happen to anybody at any time.</p><p>It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.</p><p>Love one another and help others to rise to the higher levels, simply by pouring out love. Love is infectious and the greatest healing energy.</p><p>Christmas, my child, is love in action. Every time we love, every time we give, it&#39;s Christmas.</p><p>We never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves.</p><p>I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. &#39;Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death.</p><p>Love is a serious mental disease.</p><p>To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.</p><p>I love those who yearn for the impossible.</p><p>Love to faults is always blind, always is to joy inclined. Lawless, winged, and unconfined, and breaks all chains from every mind.</p><p>What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. It has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy. It has eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men. That is what love looks like.</p><p>The sadness of the women&#39;s movement is that they don&#39;t allow the necessity of love. See, I don&#39;t personally trust any revolution where love is not allowed.</p><p>Love. Fall in love and stay in love. Write only what you love, and love what you write. The key word is love.

Do they have scars from giving? Show me your feet. Are they wounded in service? Show me your heart. Have you left a place for divine love?</p><p>Once in his life, every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead.</p><p>All, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love.</p><p>Knowledge is love and light and vision.</p><p>Love sought is good, but given unsought, is better.</p><p>I guess I have always been deeply terrified to really be someone&#39;s wife since I know from life one cannot love another, ever, really.</p><p>Who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make love known?</p><p>The game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge, place I&#39;ve always gone where I needed comfort and peace. It&#39;s been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction. It&#39;s a relationship that has evolved over time, given me the greatest respect and love for the game.</p><p>I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate - it&#39;s apathy. It&#39;s not giving a damn.</p><p>We can&#39;t command our love, but we can our actions.</p><p>One advantage of marriage is that, when you fall out of love with him or he falls out of love with you, it keeps you together until you fall in again.</p><p>If you want to be successful, it&#39;s just this simple. Know what you are doing. Love what you are doing. And believe in what you are doing.</p><p>Politics is such a torment that I advise everyone I love not to mix with it.</p><p>Justice that love gives is a surrender, justice that law gives is a punishment.</p><p>Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it&#39;s your responsibility to love it, or change it.</p><p>Speak low, if you speak love.</p><p>I&#39;m not claiming divinity. I&#39;ve never claimed purity of soul. I&#39;ve never claimed to have the answers to life. I only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as I can... But I still believe in peace, love and understanding.</p><p>True love doesn&#39;t happen right away it&#39;s an ever-growing process. It develops after you&#39;ve gone through many ups and downs, when you&#39;ve suffered together, cried together, laughed together.</p><p>This is one of the miracles of love: It gives a power of seeing through its own enchantments and yet not being disenchanted.</p><p>The best smell in the world is that man that you love.</p><p>Love one another, but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.</p><p>Love is blind friendship closes its eyes.</p><p>Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don&#39;t know how to replenish it&#39;s source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings.</p><p>I do all the evil I can before I learn to shun it? Is it not enough to know the evil to shun it?

Brute nature has been know to yield to the influence of love. You must never despair of human nature.</p><p>There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.</p><p>I&#39;m an introvert... I love being by myself, love being outdoors, love taking a long walk with my dogs and looking at the trees, flowers, the sky.</p><p>Those whom the gods love grow young.</p><p>Presents don&#39;t really mean much to me. I don&#39;t want to sound mawkish, but - it was the realization that I have a great many people in my life who really love me, and who I really love.</p><p>Flatter me, and I may not believe you. Criticize me, and I may not like you. Ignore me, and I may not forgive you. Encourage me, and I will not forget you.

If not, we should be sincere enough to admit that we love evil too well to give it up.</p><p>Love is never lost. If not reciprocated, it will flow back and soften and purify the heart.</p><p>Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman who&#39;ll give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you&#39;re in the wrong house, that&#39;s what it means.</p><p>Yesterday we obeyed kings and bent our necks before emperors. But today we kneel only to truth, follow only beauty, and obey only love.</p><p>The mother-child relationship is paradoxical and, in a sense, tragic. It requires the most intense love on the mother&#39;s side, yet this very love must help the child grow away from the mother, and to become fully independent.</p><p>Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.</p><p>Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country.</p><p>Love is trembling happiness.</p><p>Even when I&#39;m old and grey, I won&#39;t be able to play it, but I&#39;ll still love the game.</p><p>I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.</p><p>Don&#39;t do anything by half. If you love someone, love them with all your soul. When you go to work, work your ass off. When you hate someone, hate them until it hurts.</p><p>Love and doubt have never been on speaking terms.</p><p>A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself.</p><p>Doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life.</p><p>Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of.</p><p>Money can&#39;t buy love, but it improves your bargaining position.</p><p>Do not hire a man who does your work for money, but him who does it for love of it.</p><p>I wish people would love everybody else the way they love me. It would be a better world.</p><p>Alcohol may be man&#39;s worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.</p><p>Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age.</p><p>I&#39;ll love you, dear, I&#39;ll love you till China and Africa meet and the river jumps over the mountain and the salmon sing in the street.</p><p>If you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work.</p><p>Love is the expression of one&#39;s values, the greatest reward you can earn for the moral qualities you have achieved in your character and person, the emotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues of another.</p><p>Personally, I just think rap music is the best thing out there, period. If you look at my deck in my car radio, you&#39;re always going to find a hip-hop tape that&#39;s all I buy, that&#39;s all I live, that&#39;s all I listen to, that&#39;s all I love.</p><p>Success comes from taking the initiative and following up... persisting... eloquently expressing the depth of your love.

But marriage is a recognition of a spiritual identity.</p><p>Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.</p><p>When love beckons to you, follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.</p><p>Coming generations will learn equality from poverty, and love from woes.</p><p>Mother&#39;s love is peace. It need not be acquired, it need not be deserved.</p><p>If a man walks in the woods for love of them half of each day, he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer.

For even sinners do the same.</p><p>There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved.</p><p>It is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend his faults. So to love a man that you cannot bear to see a stain upon him, and to speak painful truth through loving words, that is friendship.</p><p>It is not love that is blind, but jealousy.</p><p>Romantic love is mental illness. But it&#39;s a pleasurable one. It&#39;s a drug. It distorts reality, and that&#39;s the point of it. It would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw.</p><p>Absences are a good influence in love and keep it bright and delicate.</p><p>Authenticity is the alignment of head, mouth, heart, and feet - thinking, saying, feeling, and doing the same thing - consistently. This builds trust, and followers love leaders they can trust.</p><p>The truth is I love being alive. And I love feeling free. So if I can&#39;t have those things then I feel like a caged animal and I&#39;d rather not be in a cage. I&#39;d rather be dead. And it&#39;s real simple. And I think it&#39;s not that uncommon.</p><p>The opposite of love is not hate, it&#39;s indifference.</p><p>And a special thank you to the citizens of Massachusetts: You are paying all the taxes, creating all the jobs, raising all the children. This government is yours. Thank you for letting me serve you. I love this job.</p><p>The most important thing in the world is family and love.</p><p>Love is the most important thing in the world. Hate, we should remove from the dictionary.</p><p>Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love.</p><p>Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh.</p><p>One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.</p><p>Accept that all of us can be hurt, that all of us can and surely will at times fail. Other vulnerabilities, like being embarrassed or risking love, can be terrifying, too. I think we should follow a simple rule: if we can take the worst, take the risk.</p><p>All brave men love for he only is brave who has affections to fight for, whether in the daily battle of life, or in physical contests.</p><p>I am not a vegetarian because I love animals I am a vegetarian because I hate plants.</p><p>How I Love Lucy was born? We decided that instead of divorce lawyers profiting from our mistakes, we&#39;d profit from them.</p><p>Love is the answer to everything. It&#39;s the only reason to do anything. If you don&#39;t write stories you love, you&#39;ll never make it. If you don&#39;t write stories that other people love, you&#39;ll never make it.</p><p>Computers are magnificent tools for the realization of our dreams, but no machine can replace the human spark of spirit, compassion, love, and understanding.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more I realize there is nothing more artistic than to love others.</p><p>My mother&#39;s love has always been a sustaining force for our family, and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity, her compassion, her intelligence reflected in my daughters.</p><p>Love, like a chicken salad or restaurant hash, must be taken with blind faith or it loses its flavor.</p><p>So long as we love, we serve so long as we are loved by others, I should say that we are almost indispensable and no man is useless while he has a friend.</p><p>True love is eternal, infinite, and always like itself. It is equal and pure, without violent demonstrations: it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart.</p><p>Music is what I breath, what I love to do. It keeps me alive.</p><p>Passion is momentary love is enduring.</p><p>To fall in love is easy, even to remain in it is not difficult our human loneliness is cause enough. But it is a hard quest worth making to find a comrade through whose steady presence one becomes steadily the person one desires to be.</p><p>As much as I would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time, that doesn&#39;t work for me. I&#39;d just rather sit at home and read, or go out to dinner with someone, or talk to someone I love, or talk to somebody that makes me laugh.</p><p>This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet.</p><p>I love you more than my own skin.</p><p>First and last, what is demanded of genius is love of truth.</p><p>We cannot fashion our children after our desires, we must have them and love them as God has given them to us.</p><p>To be in love is merely to be in a state of perceptual anesthesia - to mistake an ordinary young woman for a goddess.</p><p>I love to put on lotion. Sometimes I&#39;ll watch TV and go into a lotion trance for an hour. I try to find brands that don&#39;t taste bad in case anyone wants to taste me.</p><p>Prayer does not use up artificial energy, doesn&#39;t burn up any fossil fuel, doesn&#39;t pollute. Neither does song, neither does love, neither does the dance.</p><p>I love Wagner, but the music I prefer is that of a cat hung up by its tail outside a window and trying to stick to the panes of glass with its claws.</p><p>Love can do much, but duty more.</p><p>About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won&#39;t like you at all.</p><p>Love consists in giving without getting in return in giving what is not owed, what is not due the other. That&#39;s why true love is never based, as associations for utility or pleasure are, on a fair exchange.</p><p>I have a love interest in every one of my films: a gun.</p><p>There is no time for cut-and-dried monotony. There is time for work. And time for love. That leaves no other time!</p><p>I don&#39;t know if I believe in love at first sight, but of course I believe in two people having chemistry right away. A girl should be really easy to talk to. When I lose track of time because we&#39;ve been talking, I think that&#39;s really fun.</p><p>If there is such a thing as a good marriage, it is because it resembles friendship rather than love.</p><p>There are fathers who do not love their children there is no grandfather who does not adore his grandson.</p><p>Sex is a part of love. You shouldn&#39;t go around doing it unless you are in love.</p><p>When I see children, I see the face of God. That&#39;s why I love them so much. That&#39;s what I see.</p><p>In art as in love, instinct is enough.</p><p>Love always involves responsibility, and love always involves sacrifice. And we do not really love Christ unless we are prepared to face His task and to take up His Cross.</p><p>Listen to your inner-voice: Surround yourself with loving, nurturing people. Fall in love with your art and find yourself. Music is the great communicator.</p><p>Everything that I love is behind those gates. We have elephants, and giraffes, and crocodiles, and every kind of tigers and lions. And - and we have bus loads of kids, who don&#39;t get to see those things. They come up sick children, and enjoy it.</p><p>Love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters?</p><p>A lot of women don&#39;t know how to love because there&#39;s deep reasons for them not knowing how to love. And what I mean by deep reasons is deep and dark reasons.</p><p>Romantic love is an illusion. Most of us discover this truth at the end of a love affair or else when the sweet emotions of love lead us into marriage and then turn down their flames.</p><p>Only the really plain people know about love - the very fascinating ones try so hard to create an impression that they soon exhaust their talents.</p><p>The more one does and sees and feels, the more one is able to do, and the more genuine may be one&#39;s appreciation of fundamental things like home, and love, and understanding companionship.</p><p>What I am is how I came out. No one&#39;s perfect and you just have to accept your flaws and learn to love yourself.</p><p>A man always remembers his first love with special tenderness, but after that he begins to bunch them.</p><p>Marriage is not a noun it&#39;s a verb. It isn&#39;t something you get. It&#39;s something you do. It&#39;s the way you love your partner every day.</p><p>I love cats because I enjoy my home and little by little, they become its visible soul.</p><p>There is a courtesy of the heart it is allied to love. From its springs the purest courtesy in the outward behavior.</p><p>If one is desperate for love, I suggest looking at one&#39;s friends and family and see if love is all around. If not, get a new set of friends, a new family.</p><p>All married couples should learn the art of battle as they should learn the art of making love. Good battle is objective and honest - never vicious or cruel. Good battle is healthy and constructive, and brings to a marriage the principles of equal partnership.</p><p>Basketball is my passion, I love it. But my family and friends mean everything to me. That&#39;s what&#39;s important. I need my phone so I can keep in contact with them at all times.</p><p>The first symptom of love in a young man is timidity in a girl boldness.</p><p>If Jesus was here, do you think Jesus would show me any love? Do you think Jesus would love me?</p><p>I&#39;ve only been in love with a beer bottle and a mirror.</p><p>A poet is, before anything else, a person who is passionately in love with language.</p><p>I just want to do what I do best, and that&#39;s fight. I love it.</p><p>However rare true love may be, it is less so than true friendship.</p><p>The body is a house of many windows: there we all sit, showing ourselves and crying on the passers-by to come and love us.</p><p>Alcohol is like love. The first kiss is magic, the second is intimate, the third is routine. After that you take the girl&#39;s clothes off.</p><p>It is not likely that posterity will fall in love with us, but not impossible that it may respect or sympathize so a man would rather leave behind him the portrait of his spirit than a portrait of his face.</p><p>Love seeketh not itself to please, nor for itself hath any care, but for another gives its ease, and builds a Heaven in Hell&#39;s despair.</p><p>Adultery is the application of democracy to love.</p><p>Friendship at first sight, like love at first sight, is said to be the only truth.</p><p>When you start falling for somebody and you can&#39;t stop thinking about when you&#39;re going to see them again, I love that. Women are beautiful. They deserve to be cherished and respected.</p><p>The Bee Gees who are brilliant, I just love great music.</p><p>I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.</p><p>I&#39;m a romantic, and we romantics are more sensitive to the way people feel. We love more, and we hurt more. When we&#39;re hurt, we hurt for a long time.</p><p>What I&#39;ve enjoyed most, though, is meeting people who have a real interest in food and sharing ideas with them. Good food is a global thing and I find that there is always something new and amazing to learn - I love it!</p><p>Love is the delightful interval between meeting a beautiful girl and discovering that she looks like a haddock.</p><p>I love bringing roses to a woman when she least expects it.</p><p>Don&#39;t walk in front of me, I may not follow. Don&#39;t walk behind me, I may not lead. There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved.</p><p>I love power. But it is as an artist that I love it. I love it as a musician loves his violin, to draw out its sounds and chords and harmonies.</p><p>All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love.</p><p>I might get drunk one day and fall in love or fall over a hooker outside, and I would have consummated a relationship that I couldn&#39;t necessarily believe in.</p><p>Love and work... work and love, that&#39;s all there is.</p><p>I&#39;ll come and make love to you at five o&#39;clock. If I&#39;m late start without me.</p><p>Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here.</p><p>It sounds like a cliche but I also learnt that you&#39;re not going to fall for the right person until you really love yourself and feel good about how you are.</p><p>Love is an emotion that is based on an opinion of women that is impossible for those who have had any experience with them.</p><p>Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind.</p><p>If you have love in your life, it can make up for a great many things that are missing. If you don&#39;t have love in your life, no matter what else there is, it&#39;s not enough.</p><p>Ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society.</p><p>Unless you love someone, nothing else makes any sense.</p><p>I think careful cooking is love, don&#39;t you? The loveliest thing you can cook for someone who&#39;s close to you is about as nice a valentine as you can give.</p><p>Above our life we love a steadfast friend.</p><p>Mothers are the people who love us for no good reason. And those of us who are mothers know it&#39;s the most exquisite love of all.</p><p>I&#39;ve told Billy if I ever caught him cheating, I wouldn&#39;t kill him because I love his children and they need a dad. But I would beat him up. I know where all of his sports injuries are.</p><p>The distinction between children and adults, while probably useful for some purposes, is at bottom a specious one, I feel. There are only individual egos, crazy for love.</p><p>First love is first love, first marriage is first marriage, disappointment is disappointment.</p><p>So, fall asleep love, loved by me... for I know love, I am loved by thee.</p><p>The three hardest tasks in the world are neither physical feats nor intellectual achievements, but moral acts: to return love for hate, to include the excluded, and to say, &#39;I was wrong&#39;.</p><p>We&#39;ll love you just the way you are if you&#39;re perfect.</p><p>If we&#39;re destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, there&#39;s got to be a very powerful energy to fight that. I think we need more love in the world. We need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. I definitely want to contribute to that.</p><p>We don&#39;t believe in rheumatism and true love until after the first attack.</p><p>From your parents you learn love and laughter and how to put one foot before the other. But when books are opened you discover that you have wings.</p><p>Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women.</p><p>A test of a people is how it behaves toward the old. It is easy to love children. Even tyrants and dictators make a point of being fond of children. But the affection and care for the old, the incurable, the helpless are the true gold mines of a culture.</p><p>Falling out of love is chiefly a matter of forgetting how charming someone is.</p><p>Our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better.</p><p>A flower falls, even though we love it and a weed grows, even though we do not love it.</p><p>Chemistry can be a good and bad thing. Chemistry is good when you make love with it. Chemistry is bad when you make crack with it.</p><p>When you are older you will understand how precious little things, seemingly of no value in themselves, can be loved and prized above all price when they convey the love and thoughtfulness of a good heart.</p><p>If you don&#39;t love me, it does not matter, anyway I can love for both of us.</p><p>I love my family and I miss them very much but I&#39;m a new person now. I know a lot of people will not agree with what I&#39;ve done, but it was right for me.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to love them. You just have to respect their rights.</p><p>The love of a mother is the veil of a softer light between the heart and the heavenly Father.</p><p>People love westerns worldwide. There&#39;s something fantasy-like about an individual fighting the elements. Or even bad guys and the elements. It&#39;s a simpler time. There&#39;s no organized laws and stuff.</p><p>True love doesn&#39;t come to you it has to be inside you.</p><p>Even though I love solar and love wind, like most people do, I like the renewable sources, they alone are not going to get America energy independent.</p><p>This is the America that I love. This is a great people. We can do anything. We can achieve anything. We&#39;ve got a government that has gotten in the way of the American people. We&#39;re going to change that in November.</p><p>A man without ambition is dead. A man with ambition but no love is dead. A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive.</p><p>Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country, it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it.</p><p>Love is a portion of the soul itself, and it is of the same nature as the celestial breathing of the atmosphere of paradise.</p><p>Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.</p><p>And I love that even in the toughest moments, when we&#39;re all sweating it - when we&#39;re worried that the bill won&#39;t pass, and it seems like all is lost - Barack never lets himself get distracted by the chatter and the noise. Just like his grandmother, he just keeps getting up and moving forward... with patience and wisdom, and courage and grace.</p><p>Love never dies of starvation, but often of indigestion.</p><p>Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain it.</p><p>There is nothing I love as much as a good fight.</p><p>Just don&#39;t give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I don&#39;t think you can go wrong.</p><p>Everyone got kind of crazy with me mentioning I was in love with a woman.</p><p>There is a fountain of youth: it is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will truly have defeated age.</p><p>The highest patriotism is not a blind acceptance of official policy, but a love of one&#39;s country deep enough to call her to a higher plain.</p><p>In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.</p><p>Love is an attempt at penetrating another being, but it can only succeed if the surrender is mutual.</p><p>People everywhere love Windows.</p><p>Love is easy, and I love writing. You can&#39;t resist love. You get an idea, someone says something, and you&#39;re in love.</p><p>Act happy, feel happy, be happy, without a reason in the world. Then you can love, and do what you will.</p><p>I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies.</p><p>If you&#39;re lucky enough to have a pretty girl love you and share herself and sleep with you, make that your secret. The best way to spoil love is by talking to too many people about it.</p><p>I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth - and truth rewarded me.</p><p>I say to people who care for people who are dying, if you really love that person and want to help them, be with them when their end comes close. Sit with them - you don&#39;t even have to talk. You don&#39;t have to do anything but really be there with them.</p><p>At best the family teaches the finest things human beings can learn from one another generosity and love. But it is also, all too often, where we learn nasty things like hate, rage and shame.</p><p>True love cannot be found where it does not exist, nor can it be denied where it does.</p><p>If thou desire the love of God and man, be humble, for the proud heart, as it loves none but itself, is beloved of none but itself. Humility enforces where neither virtue, nor strength, nor reason can prevail.</p><p>No woman ever hates a man for being in love with her, but many a woman hate a man for being a friend to her.</p><p>To live in this world, you must be able to do three things: to love what is mortal to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it and, when the time comes to let it go, to let it go.</p><p>There isn&#39;t any formula or method. You learn to love by loving - by paying attention and doing what one thereby discovers has to be done.</p><p>Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age.</p><p>The planter, the farmer, the mechanic, and the laborer... form the great body of the people of the United States, they are the bone and sinew of the country men who love liberty and desire nothing but equal rights and equal laws.</p><p>You don&#39;t walk away if you love someone. You help the person.</p><p>Love is union with somebody, or something, outside oneself, under the condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of one&#39;s own self.</p><p>Where love rules, there is no will to power and where power predominates, there love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.</p><p>If one of two lovers is loyal, and the other jealous and false, how may their friendship last, for Love is slain!</p><p>Those who have the strength and the love to sit with a dying patient in the silence that goes beyond words will know that this moment is neither frightening nor painful, but a peaceful cessation of the functioning of the body.</p><p>In our minds, love and lust are really separated. It&#39;s hard to find someone that can be kind and you can trust enough to leave your kids with, and isn&#39;t afraid to throw her man up against the wall and lick him from head to toe.</p><p>Why love if losing hurts so much? I have no answers anymore only the life I have lived. The pain now is part of the happiness then.</p><p>I love to hit people. I love to.</p><p>I&#39;m getting a wrinkle above my eyebrow because I just can&#39;t stop lifting it, and I love that you know.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/quotes/edit/main/src/guide/You can learn.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Woody%20Allen.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Woody Allen d4f</span></a><!----></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
