It was the worst period of my life. Neither Desi nor I have been the same since, physically or mentally.</p><p>In all our deeds, the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure.</p><p>A person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms agains himself. He makes his failure certain by himself being the first person to be convinced of it.</p><p>A man can get discouraged many times but he is not a failure until he begins to blame somebody else and stops trying.</p><p>There is but one cause of human failure. And that is man&#39;s lack of faith in his true Self.</p><p>If those committed to the quest fail, they will be forgiven. When lost, they will find another way. The moral imperative of humanism is the endeavor alone, whether successful or not, provided the effort is honorable and failure memorable.</p><p>There can be no failure to a man who has not lost his courage, his character, his self respect, or his self-confidence. He is still a King.</p><p>Every great work, every big accomplishment, has been brought into manifestation through holding to the vision, and often just before the big achievement, comes apparent failure and discouragement.</p><p>Fear stifles our thinking and actions. It creates indecisiveness that results in stagnation. I have known talented people who procrastinate indefinitely rather than risk failure. Lost opportunities cause erosion of confidence, and the downward spiral begins.</p><p>There is no failure except in no longer trying. There is no defeat except from within, no really insurmountable barrier save our own inherent weakness of purpose.</p><p>Sound character provides the power with which a person may ride the emergencies of life instead of being overwhelmed by them. Failure is... the highway to success.</p><p>Failure is not an option. Everyone has to succeed.</p><p>Destiny: A tyrant&#39;s authority for crime and a fool&#39;s excuse for failure.</p><p>Forget about the consequences of failure. Failure is only a temporary change in direction to set you straight for your next success.</p><p>Laziness is a secret ingredient that goes into failure. But it&#39;s only kept a secret from the person who fails.</p><p>No man is a failure who is enjoying life.</p><p>While it is important for people to see your promise you must also remember that hope is the keeper of both happiness and disappointment, the father of both progress and failure.</p><p>If there exists no possibility of failure, then victory is meaningless.</p><p>I&#39;d rather be a failure at something I love than a success at something I hate.</p><p>No man can be a failure if he thinks he&#39;s a success If he thinks he is a winner, then he is.</p><p>Failure is not our only punishment for laziness there is also the success of others.</p><p>The failure of national economic policy is costing us more than jobs it has begun to weaken that uniquely American spirit of risk-taking, large ambition, and optimism about the future. We must rally them now to bold departures that rebuild our national morale as well as our material prosperity.</p><p>Why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me.</p><p>I&#39;m proof against that word failure. I&#39;ve seen behind it. The only failure a man ought to fear is failure of cleaving to the purpose he sees to be best.</p><p>All human actions are equivalent and all are on principle doomed to failure.</p><p>Ideology, politics and journalism, which luxuriate in failure, are impotent in the face of hope and joy.</p><p>Not failure, but low aim, is crime.</p><p>In Torch Song, I did that character almost non-stop from 1978 until I made the movie in 1987. Then I had some failure, which also colors how you react to doing other things.</p><p>The idea of capitalism is not just success but also the failure that allows success to happen.</p><p>Creative risk taking is essential to success in any goal where the stakes are high. Thoughtless risks are destructive, of course, but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity.</p><p>They talk about the failure of socialism but where is the success of capitalism in Africa, Asia and Latin America?</p><p>Don&#39;t fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of a life contains three descriptions: could have, might have, and should have.</p><p>There are only really a few stories to tell in the end, and betrayal and the failure of love is one of those good stories to tell.</p><p>To begin to think with purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment.</p><p>Failure is a great teacher, and I think when you make mistakes and you recover from them and you treat them as valuable learning experiences, then you&#39;ve got something to share.</p><p>My fault, my failure, is not in the passions I have, but in my lack of control of them.</p><p>Failure is instructive. The person who really thinks learns quite as much from his failures as from his successes.</p><p>Success or failure in business is caused more by the mental attitude even than by mental capacities.</p><p>You may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing that we call &#39;failure&#39; is not the falling down, but the staying down.</p><p>My dad encouraged us to fail. Growing up, he would ask us what we failed at that week. If we didn&#39;t have something, he would be disappointed. It changed my mindset at an early age that failure is not the outcome, failure is not trying. Don&#39;t be afraid to fail.</p><p>He who risks and fails can be forgiven. He who never risks and never fails is a failure in his whole being.</p><p>Big companies are like marching bands. Even if half the band is playing random notes, it still sounds kind of like music. The concealment of failure is built into them.</p><p>A failure establishes only this, that our determination to succeed was not strong enough.</p><p>One of the reasons people stop learning is that they become less and less willing to risk failure.</p><p>My father was not a failure. After all, he was the father of a president of the United States.</p><p>Greatly begin. Though thou have time, but for a line, be that sublime. Not failure, but low aim is crime.</p><p>Mohammed was not an apparent failure. He was a dazzling success, politically as well as spiritually, and Islam went from strength to strength to strength.</p><p>No experience is a cause of success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences, so-called trauma - but we make out of them just what suits our purposes.</p><p>The freedom to fail is vital if you&#39;re going to succeed. Most successful people fail from time to time, and it is a measure of their strength that failure merely propels them into some new attempt at success.</p><p>No matter how vast, how total, the failure of man here on earth, the work of man will be resumed elsewhere. War leaders talk of resuming operations on this front and that, but man&#39;s front embraces the whole universe.</p><p>I have a lack of fear, whereas in the past the fear of failure was a powerful motivator. Anyway, I have great expectations for the future, but I just don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the monarch of all I survey.</p><p>War remains the decisive human failure.</p><p>Failure is only postponed success as long as courage &#39;coaches&#39; ambition. The habit of persistence is the habit of victory.</p><p>If Liberia has failed, then, it is no evidence of the failure of the Negro in government. It is merely evidence of the failure of slavery.</p><p>Every adversity, every failure, and every heartache, carries with it the Seed of an equivalent or greater Benefit.</p><p>However things may seem, no evil thing is success and no good thing is failure.</p><p>There is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object.</p><p>We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery.</p><p>Success is not a good teacher, failure makes you humble.</p><p>Women, like men, should try to do the impossible. And when they fail, their failure should be a challenge to others.</p><p>Discipline is based on pride, on meticulous attention to details, and on mutual respect and confidence. Discipline must be a habit so ingrained that it is stronger than the excitement of the goal or the fear of failure.</p><p>The only real failure in life is one not learned from.</p><p>There is no loneliness greater than the loneliness of a failure. The failure is a stranger in his own house.</p><p>Keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final.</p><p>I&#39;m hopeful. I know there is a lot of ambition in Washington, obviously. But I hope the ambitious realize that they are more likely to succeed with success as opposed to failure.</p><p>As I said there is nothing wrong with failing. Pick yourself up and try it again. You never are going to know how good you really are until you go out and face failure.</p><p>I read less and less. I have not forgiven books for their failure to tell me the truth and make me happy.</p><p>The point is not to take the world&#39;s opinion as a guiding star but to go one&#39;s way in life and working unerringly, neither depressed by failure nor seduced by applause.</p><p>Children love and want to be loved and they very much prefer the joy of accomplishment to the triumph of hateful failure. Do not mistake a child for his symptom.</p><p>It is often the failure who is the pioneer in new lands, new undertakings, and new forms of expression.</p><p>Often the difference between a successful man and a failure is not one&#39;s better abilities or ideas, but the courage that one has to bet on his ideas, to take a calculated risk, and to act.</p><p>Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.</p><p>I have always been pushed by the negative. The apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night, before the reviews are out. I am more compelled to get back to work than if I had a success.</p><p>But while success and failure depend on conditions, the mind neither waxes nor wanes.</p><p>It&#39;s not necessary to fear the prospect of failure but to be determined not to fail.</p><p>Failure means a stripping away of the inessential.</p><p>We need to teach the highly educated man that it is not a disgrace to fail and that he must analyze every failure to find its cause. He must learn how to fail intelligently, for failing is one of the greatest arts in the world.</p><p>Don&#39;t think of it as failure. Think of it as time-released success.</p><p>Sometimes failure isn&#39;t an opportunity in disguise, it&#39;s just you.</p><p>Failure is authentic, and because it&#39;s authentic, it&#39;s real and genuine, and because of that, it&#39;s a pure state of being.</p><p>In high school, in sport, I had a coach who told me I was much better than I thought I was, and would make me do more in a positive sense. He was the first person who taught me not to be afraid of failure.</p><p>Crime and bad lives are the measure of a State&#39;s failure, all crime in the end is the crime of the community.</p><p>Whether in success or in failure, I&#39;m proud of every single movie I&#39;ve ever directed.</p><p>Failure has gone to his head.</p><p>Any critic is entitled to wrong judgments, of course. But certain lapses of judgment indicate the radical failure of an entire sensibility.</p><p>Belief in the supernatural reflects a failure of the imagination.</p><p>Man&#39;s sin is in his failure to live what he is. Being the master of the earth, man forgets that he is the servant of God.</p><p>If a building looks better under construction than it does when finished, then it&#39;s a failure.</p><p>Sometimes the best lighting of all is a power failure.</p><p>Most success springs from an obstacle or failure. I became a cartoonist largely because I failed in my goal of becoming a successful executive.</p><p>Young players need freedom of expression to develop as creative players... they should be encouraged to try skills without fear of failure.</p><p>I love Rauschenberg. I love that he created a turning point in visual history, that he redefined the idea of beauty, that he combined painting, sculpture, photography, and everyday life with such gall, and that he was interested in, as he put it, &#39;the ability to conceive failure as progress.&#39;</p><p>This dullness of vision regarding the importance of the general welfare to the individual is the measure of the failure of our schools and churches to teach the spiritual significance of genuine democracy.</p><p>A real failure does not need an excuse. It is an end in itself.</p><p>The man who has done his level best... is a success, even though the world may write him down a failure.</p><p>Any man who has $10,000 left when he dies is a failure.</p><p>There is much to be said for failure. It is much more interesting than success.</p><p>You have to be able to accept failure to get better.</p><p>Please know that I am aware of the hazards. I want to do it because I want to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failure must be a challenge to others.</p><p>Success is simply a matter of luck. Ask any failure.</p><p>The will to persevere is often the difference between failure and success.</p><p>Failure is simply the non-presence of success. But a fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions.</p><p>I believe in trusting men, not only once but twice - in giving a failure another chance.</p><p>Within the U.S., the Obama presidency will be mainly measured by the success or failure of his economic policies. And here, I fear, the monstrous stimulus package with which this administration stumbled out of the gate will prove to be Obama&#39;s Waterloo.</p><p>The person interested in success has to learn to view failure as a healthy, inevitable part of the process of getting to the top.</p><p>The failure of academic feminists to recognize difference as a crucial strength is a failure to reach beyond the first patriarchal lesson. In our world, divide and conquer must become define and empower.</p><p>Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail their failure must be but a challenge to others.</p><p>Mass transportation is doomed to failure in North America because a person&#39;s car is the only place where he can be alone and think.</p><p>If we don&#39;t succeed we run the risk of failure.</p><p>Most of us spend the first six days of each week sowing wild oats then we go to church on Sunday and pray for a crop failure.</p><p>Ultimately, all human activities have as their goal the realization of happiness. Why, then, have we ended up producing the opposite result? Could the underlying cause be our failure to correctly understand the true nature of happiness?</p><p>I don&#39;t want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what I really care about.</p><p>Translation is the art of failure.</p><p>I&#39;ve probably earned the right to screw up a few times. I don&#39;t want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what I really care about.</p><p>I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure - which is: Try to please everybody.</p><p>For families across the UK who are income-poor, but more than that, whose lives are blighted by worklessness, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt and poor health, as well as other problems, giving them an extra pound - say through increased benefits - will not address the reason they find themselves in difficulty in the first place.</p><p>Not failure, but low aim is sin.</p><p>Failure is a part of success.</p><p>We know there is no such thing as freedom without the risk of failure.</p><p>Heaven knows that I have done all that a mortal could do, to save the people, and the failure was not my fault, but the fault of others.</p><p>Success is usually the culmination of controlling failure.</p><p>There are no mistakes, save one: the failure to learn from a mistake.</p><p>So many financial dreams are thwarted by the failure to act upon good intentions.</p><p>A minute&#39;s success pays the failure of years.</p><p>Who I am as a guitarist is defined by my failure to become Jimi Hendrix.</p><p>There&#39;s no right or wrong, success or failure.</p><p>That sense of failure, I don&#39;t know where people put it who don&#39;t write songs and aren&#39;t able to emote physically. It must go somewhere.</p><p>In politics, what begins in fear usually ends in failure.</p><p>If you&#39;re the type of person who has to fulfill your dreams, you&#39;ve gotta be resourceful to make sure you can do it. I came out to California when I was 21, thinking my New York credentials would take me all the way. I came back home a year later all dejected and a failure.</p><p>I think you have to try and fail, because failure gets you closer to what you&#39;re good at.</p><p>Pressure is a word that is misused in our vocabulary. When you start thinking of pressure, it&#39;s because you&#39;ve started to think of failure.</p><p>About the only problem with success is that it does not teach you how to deal with failure.</p><p>The main failure of education is that it has not prepared people to comprehend matters concerning human destiny.</p><p>It is a mistake to suppose that men succeed through success they much oftener succeed through failures. Precept, study, advice, and example could never have taught them so well as failure has done.</p><p>Success and failure are both part of life. Both are not permanent.</p><p>I want to swim in both directions at once.

Well, it has not been easy.</p><p>I believe the world is one big family, and we need to help each other.</p><p>When I was younger, my family would go camping and fishing on our ranches. My dad loves being around all kinds of animals. He&#39;s the one who got me to be a really big animal lover.</p><p>I grew up in a big family with a lot of kids around, and I definitely want to have children as well.</p><p>My life comes down to three moments: the death of my father, meeting my husband, and the birth of my daughter. Everything I did previous to that just doesn&#39;t seem to add up to very much.</p><p>The attempt to redefine the family as a purely voluntary arrangement grows out of the modern delusion that people can keep all their options open all the time.</p><p>It is extraordinary that when you are acquainted with a whole family you can forget about them.</p><p>It takes a lot of work to put together a marriage, to put together a family and a home.</p><p>Family life itself, that safest, most traditional, most approved of female choices, is not a sanctuary: It is, perpetually, a dangerous place.</p><p>A family is a risky venture, because the greater the love, the greater the loss... That&#39;s the trade-off. But I&#39;ll take it all.</p><p>You leave home to seek your fortune and, when you get it, you go home and share it with your family.</p><p>I mean, I look at my dad. He was twenty when he started having a family, and he was always the coolest dad. He did everything for his kids, and he never made us feel like he was pressured. I know that it must be a great feeling to be a guy like that.</p><p>I find the family the most mysterious and fascinating institution in the world.</p><p>Pray in your family daily, that yours may be in the number of the families who call upon God.</p><p>If we abandon marriage, we abandon the family.</p><p>I am tortured when I am away from my family, from my children. I am horribly guilt-ridden.</p><p>The left dismisses talk about the collapse of family life and talks instead about the emergence of the growing new diversity of family types.</p><p>Women&#39;s natural role is to be a pillar of the family.</p><p>Some of the most important conversations I&#39;ve ever had occurred at my family&#39;s dinner table.</p><p>It&#39;s not that our family has no taste, it&#39;s just that our family&#39;s taste is inconsistent.</p><p>A woman should be home with the children, building that home and making sure there&#39;s a secure family atmosphere.</p><p>I consider my mom and all my sisters my friends.</p><p>A woman can plan when to have her family and how to support a family.</p><p>I&#39;m not much of a family man.

I love kids, I adore them, but I don&#39;t want to live my life for them.</p><p>My family is more important than my party.</p><p>I am the family face flesh perishes, I live on.</p><p>I stay in tune with my family and God.</p><p>When I&#39;m ready, I plan to adopt. I still believe in family.</p><p>I would rather start a family than finish one.</p><p>You have to defend your honor. And your family.</p><p>Happy is said to be the family which can eat onions together. They are, for the time being, separate, from the world, and have a harmony of aspiration.</p><p>I have a family to support. And I&#39;m not always going to be doing exactly what I want to do.</p><p>Parents need all the help they can get. The strongest as well as the most fragile family requires a vital network of social supports.</p><p>When you start about family, about lineage and ancestry, you are talking about every person on earth.</p><p>I would love a family. I&#39;m at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger. But who knows.</p><p>I have a lot of very close girlfriends and sisters - I&#39;m from an all female family. My father often quips that even the cat was neutered!</p><p>At a certain point I&#39;m going to want to have a family.</p><p>I love my family.</p><p>For all of those willing to help me start a family, I am flattered. I will let you know when I need your help.</p><p>I realized my family was funny, because nobody ever wanted to leave our house.</p><p>The one thing that kept our family together was the music. The only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music.</p><p>My family was my guide to my reality.</p><p>We&#39;ll sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids. But obviously we want a family so we&#39;ll have to start thinking about that.</p><p>I love children and I get along with them great. It&#39;s just that I believe if you&#39;re going to be a parent, there has to be something inside you that says, &#39;I want a family.&#39; I don&#39;t feel that sense of urgency.</p><p>I love cooking for myself and cooking for my family.</p><p>Also, my mom and family are very important to me and I know that this is not expected.</p><p>I live quietly at home among my family and friends.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if I believe in marriage.

They were always indignantly leaving places.</p><p>If I had no family, my wife and I would lead a much more romantic and nomadic existence.</p><p>Family, nature and health all go together.</p><p>There are things that you cannot talk to your mother and father about, there are things that you cannot talk to your children about.</p><p>Once I got married and had kids, I moved away from romantic roles, because it seemed wrong to have my 3-year-old wondering why Daddy was kissing someone else.</p><p>I grew up in a very religious family. I could read the Qu&#39;ran easily at the age of five.</p><p>The foundation of family - that&#39;s where it all begins for me.</p><p>I grew up in a family in which political issues were often discussed, and debated intensely.</p><p>I have these visions of myself being thirty, thirty-five, forty having a family.</p><p>My family background was deeply Christian.</p><p>Like all my family and class, I considered it a sign of weakness to show affection to have been caught kissing my mother would have been a disgrace, and to have shown affection for my father would have been a disaster.</p><p>The joke in our family is that we can cry reading the phone book.</p><p>We went to church every Sunday. When I was a kid, the only time I sang was around my family.</p><p>Our family life was certainly not intellectual.</p><p>We love to be with our family and friends and I can tell you that lots of eating will be involved.</p><p>My whole damn family was nice. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve imagined it. It&#39;s true. Maybe it has to do with being brought up as Christian Scientists. Half of my relatives were Readers or Practitioners in the church.</p><p>God did not intend the human family to be wafted to heaven on flowery beds of ease.</p><p>To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one&#39;s family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one&#39;s own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him.</p><p>As a child my family&#39;s menu consisted of two choices: take it or leave it.</p><p>Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don&#39;t wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it&#39;s at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.</p><p>In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don&#39;t try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.</p><p>The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other&#39;s life.</p><p>Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city.</p><p>It&#39;s all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family.</p><p>Every child should have a caring adult in their lives. And that&#39;s not always a biological parent or family member. It may be a friend or neighbor. Often times it is a teacher.</p><p>As the family goes, so goes the nation and so goes the whole world in which we live.</p><p>Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual differences are appreciated, mistakes are tolerated, communication is open, and rules are flexible - the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing family.</p><p>My family, frankly, they weren&#39;t folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn&#39;t raise me in the church, so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.</p><p>It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, family leave, health insurance, Social Security, Medicare, retirement plans. The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label.</p><p>The great danger for family life, in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure, comfort and independence, lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish.</p><p>Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the only proper basis for family life.</p><p>Actors are one family over the entire world.</p><p>He that raises a large family does, indeed, while he lives to observe them, stand a broader mark for sorrow but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too.</p><p>Any problem, big or small, within a family, always seems to start with bad communication. Someone isn&#39;t listening.</p><p>When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, &#39;Why god? Why me?&#39; and the thundering voice of God answered, &#39;There&#39;s just something about you that pisses me off.&#39;</p><p>Never lose sight of the fact that the most important yardstick of your success will be how you treat other people - your family, friends, and coworkers, and even strangers you meet along the way.</p><p>The other night I ate at a real nice family restaurant. Every table had an argument going.</p><p>I can make a firm pledge, under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.</p><p>All men are children, and of one family. The same tale sends them all to bed, and wakes them in the morning.</p><p>No matter what you&#39;ve done for yourself or for humanity, if you can&#39;t look back on having given love and attention to your own family, what have you really accomplished?</p><p>It&#39;s true, Christmas can feel like a lot of work, particularly for mothers. But when you look back on all the Christmases in your life, you&#39;ll find you&#39;ve created family traditions and lasting memories. Those memories, good and bad, are really what help to keep a family together over the long haul.</p><p>Once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success, it enables you to ignore the minor hurts, the opponent&#39;s pressure, and the temporary failures.</p><p>The details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private, and I had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family.</p><p>So much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family, that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty. All other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it.</p><p>I would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living life, a man who had good friends, fine family - and I don&#39;t think I could ask for anything more than that, actually.</p><p>Positive feelings come from being honest about yourself and accepting your personality, and physical characteristics, warts and all and, from belonging to a family that accepts you without question.</p><p>To maintain a joyful family requires much from both the parents and the children. Each member of the family has to become, in a special way, the servant of the others.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest social service that can be rendered by anybody to the country and to mankind is to bring up a family.</p><p>My friends and family are my support system. They tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times. Without them I have no idea where I would be and I know that their love for me is what&#39;s keeping my head above the water.</p><p>The first-born in every family is always dreaming for an imaginary older brother or sister who will look out for them.</p><p>All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and God&#39;s love - this world would be a far more gentle and better place.</p><p>But let me perfectly clear, because I know you&#39;ll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people: if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one single dime.</p><p>If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family anatidae on our hands.</p><p>If I win and get the money, then the Oakland Police department is going to buy a boys&#39; home, me a house, my family a house, and a Stop Police Brutality Center.</p><p>On Thanksgiving I will stop to give thanks that my family is safe and healthy, especially because I realize that, following the tragedies of this year, it is all too real a possibility that they might not have been.</p><p>Blood relatives often have nothing to do with family, and similarly, family is about who you choose to make your life with.</p><p>I am confident that nobody... will accuse me of selfishness if I ask to spend time, while I am still in good health, with my family, my friends and also with myself.</p><p>I looked up my family tree and found three dogs using it.</p><p>All happy families resemble one another, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.</p><p>With all my fans I got a family again.</p><p>My restaurants are never opened on Thanksgiving I want my staff to spend time with their family if they can. My feeling is, if I can&#39;t figure out how to make money the rest of the year so that my workers can enjoy the holidays, then I don&#39;t deserve to be an owner.</p><p>The most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.</p><p>I come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage.</p><p>In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before.</p><p>Family is conflict and it&#39;s something that we all relate to.</p><p>So live that you wouldn&#39;t be ashamed to sell the family parrot to the town gossip.</p><p>Smartness runs in my family. When I went to school I was so smart my teacher was in my class for five years.</p><p>We believed in our idea - a family park where parents and children could have fun- together.</p><p>Like religion, politics, and family planning, cereal is not a topic to be brought up in public. It&#39;s too controversial.</p><p>Friendship is held to be the severest test of character. It is easy, we think, to be loyal to a family and clan, whose blood is in your own veins.</p><p>Marriage is an act of will that signifies and involves a mutual gift, which unites the spouses and binds them to their eventual souls, with whom they make up a sole family - a domestic church.</p><p>I have Muslim members of my family. I have lived in Muslim countries.</p><p>I looked up my family tree and found out I was the sap.</p><p>As a single withered tree, if set aflame, causes a whole forest to burn, so does a rascal son destroy a whole family.</p><p>I love my family very much. I wish I could see them a little more often than I do. But we understand because we&#39;re a show business family and we all work.</p><p>This is all the inheritance I give to my dear family. The religion of Christ will give them one which will make them rich indeed.</p><p>My biggest hobby is hanging out with my family and kids.</p><p>I was angry and frustrated until I started my own family and my first child was born. Until then I didn&#39;t really appreciate life the way I should have, but fortunately I woke up.</p><p>The most important thing in the world is family and love.</p><p>My mother&#39;s love has always been a sustaining force for our family, and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity, her compassion, her intelligence reflected in my daughters.</p><p>A man ought to live so that everybody knows he is a Christian... and most of all, his family ought to know.</p><p>If you cannot work on the marriage or the women is a moron, staying married and cheating makes the most sense because divorce is disruptive to the family life and your bank account.</p><p>The American culture promotes personal responsibility, the dignity of work, the value of education, the merit of service, devotion to a purpose greater than self, and at the foundation, the pre-eminence of family.</p><p>Now is the moment when we can stand up and say, &#39;I&#39;m an American. I make my destiny. And we deserve better! My children deserve better! My family deserves better. My country deserves better!&#39; So here we stand. Americans have a choice.</p><p>My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution.</p><p>The promise of America has always been that if you worked hard, had the right values, took some risks, that there was an opportunity to build a better life for your family and for your next generation.</p><p>President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. My promise... is to help you and your family.</p><p>When someone has cancer, the whole family and everyone who loves them does, too.</p><p>I love my family and I miss them very much but I&#39;m a new person now. I know a lot of people will not agree with what I&#39;ve done, but it was right for me.</p><p>I have now disposed of all my property to my family. There is one thing more I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion.</p><p>Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family.</p><p>Nobody has ever before asked the nuclear family to live all by itself in a box the way we do. With no relatives, no support, we&#39;ve put it in an impossible situation.</p><p>You cannot have maternal health without reproductive health. And reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal, safe abortion.</p><p>Family quarrels are bitter things. They don&#39;t go according to any rules. They&#39;re not like aches or wounds, they&#39;re more like splits in the skin that won&#39;t heal because there&#39;s not enough material.</p><p>All the men in my family were bearded, and most of the women.</p><p>I&#39;m just glad I was able to return to some of that innocence and beauty I had as a child when I started my own family, and my children brought me back some of that spirit.</p><p>Be strong, believe in freedom and in God, love yourself, understand your sexuality, have a sense of humor, masturbate, don&#39;t judge people by their religion, color or sexual habits, love life and your family.</p><p>If you ever start feeling like you have the goofiest, craziest, most dysfunctional family in the world, all you have to do is go to a state fair. Because five minutes at the fair, you&#39;ll be going, &#39;you know, we&#39;re alright. We are dang near royalty.&#39;</p><p>The place of the father in the modern suburban family is a very small one, particularly if he plays golf.</p><p>A family with the wrong members in control that, perhaps, is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase.</p><p>Cherish your human connections: your relationships with friends and family.</p><p>All in the Family was intellectual it was art.</p><p>Where would you be without friends? The people to pick you up when you need lifting? We come from homes far from perfect, so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends - your own chosen family. There&#39;s nothing like a really loyal, dependable, good friend. Nothing.</p><p>I think every girl needs to love herself, regardless of anything. Like if you&#39;re having a bad day, if you don&#39;t like your hair, if you don&#39;t have the best family situation, whatever, you have to love yourself and you can&#39;t do anything until you love yourself first.</p><p>In my family, we were Americans, we were Republicans and we were Methodists.</p><p>No one really wants to admit they are lonely, and it is never really addressed very much between friends and family. But I have felt lonely many times in my life.</p><p>I think every chef, not just in America, but across the world, has a double-edged sword - two jackets, one that&#39;s driven, a self-confessed perfectionist, thoroughbred, hate incompetence and switch off the stove, take off the jacket and become a family man.</p><p>Basketball is my passion, I love it. But my family and friends mean everything to me. That&#39;s what&#39;s important. I need my phone so I can keep in contact with them at all times.</p><p>Happy or unhappy, families are all mysterious. We have only to imagine how differently we would be described - and will be, after our deaths - by each of the family members who believe they know us.</p><p>I believe with all my heart that America remains &#39;the great idea&#39; that inspires the world. It is a privilege to be born here. It is an honor to become a citizen here. It is a gift to raise your family here, to vote here, and to live here.</p><p>No amount of law enforcement can solve a problem that goes back to the family.</p><p>Family love is messy, clinging, and of an annoying and repetitive pattern, like bad wallpaper.</p><p>The seven deadly sins: Want of money, bad health, bad temper, chastity, family ties, knowing that you know things, and believing in the Christian religion.</p><p>Nixon was the most dishonest individual I have ever met in my life. He lied to his wife, his family, his friends, his colleagues in the Congress, lifetime members of his own political party, the American people and the world.</p><p>Apparently, one in five people in the world are Chinese. And there are five people in my family, so it must be one of them. It&#39;s either my mum or my dad. Or my older brother, Colin. Or my younger brother, Ho-Chan-Chu. But I think it&#39;s Colin.</p><p>If you have autism in the family history, you still vaccinate. Delay it a bit, space them out.</p><p>I am blessed to have so many great things in my life - family, friends and God. All will be in my thoughts daily.</p><p>At best the family teaches the finest things human beings can learn from one another generosity and love. But it is also, all too often, where we learn nasty things like hate, rage and shame.</p><p>I say, If everybody in this house lives where it&#39;s God first, friends and family second and you third, we won&#39;t ever have an argument.</p><p>But the problem is that when I go around and speak on campuses, I still don&#39;t get young men standing up and saying, &#39;How can I combine career and family?&#39;</p><p>My father was brought up in an orphanage in the Catskills. He was a factory worker. And because his family wasn&#39;t there for him, family was everything. We could disagree inside the house, but outside the house it was us against the world. So when I became a drag actor, he looked sideways but said okay.</p><p>My family and I would never receive royalties on the revenue that my materials brought into the church materials that were created on our own personal time.</p><p>A good job is more than just a paycheck. A good job fosters independence and discipline, and contributes to the health of the community. A good job is a means to provide for the health and welfare of your family, to own a home, and save for retirement.</p><p>My work and my family are very important to me.</p><p>I refuse to feel guilty. I feel guilty about too much in my life but not about money.

There are two kinds of Irish families: the hitting kind and the kidding kind. If you&#39;re fortunate - and both of us are - you come from the kidding kind of Irish family.</p><p>My family kinda hit the skids. We were experiencing poverty at that point. We all got a job, where the whole family had to work as security guards and janitors. And I just got angry.</p><p>The practice of patience toward one another, the overlooking of one another&#39;s defects, and the bearing of one another&#39;s burdens is the most elementary condition of all human and social activity in the family, in the professions, and in society.</p><p>It&#39;s hard knowing who to trust with your personal life. When you cry in your room at night, you don&#39;t always know who to call. So I am very close to my family.</p><p>The most remarkable thing about my mother is that for thirty years she served the family nothing but leftovers. The original meal has never been found.</p><p>Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They&#39;re keeping up with their friends and family, but they&#39;re also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand. They&#39;re connecting with the audience that they want to connect to. It&#39;s almost a disadvantage if you&#39;re not on it now.</p><p>Italians come to ruin most generally in three ways, women, gambling, and farming. My family chose the slowest one.</p><p>I had this child, and it destroyed my family.</p><p>People should watch out for three things: avoid a major addiction, don&#39;t get so deeply into debt that it controls your life, and don&#39;t start a family before you&#39;re ready to settle down.</p><p>I was told to avoid the business all together because of the rejection. People would say to me, &#39;Don&#39;t you want to have a normal job and a normal family?&#39; I guess that would be good advice for some people, but I wanted to act.</p><p>There is little less trouble in governing a private family than a whole kingdom.</p><p>There is not much less vexation in the government of a private family than in the managing of an entire state.</p><p>The God who existed before any religion counts on you to make the oneness of the human family known and celebrated.</p><p>I do have a close circle of friends and I am very fortunate to have them as friends. I feel very close to them I think friends are everything in life after your family. You come across lots of people all the time but you only make very few friends and you have to be true to them otherwise what&#39;s the point in life?</p><p>The baby boomers are getting older, and will stay older for longer.

They have shown true love and commitment to me by being supportive. They shared in it.</p><p>Sure, I have friends, plenty of friends, and they all come around wantin&#39; to borrow money. I&#39;ve always been generous with my friends and family, with money, but selfish with the important stuff like love.</p><p>There are no adequate substitutes for father, mother, and children bound together in a loving commitment to nurture and protect. No government, no matter how well-intentioned, can take the place of the family in the scheme of things.</p><p>Christmas can have a real melancholy aspect, &#39;cause it packages itself as this idea of perfect family cohesion and love, and you&#39;re always going to come up short when you measure your personal life against the idealized personal lives that are constantly thrust in our faces, primarily by TV commercials.</p><p>As women slowly gain power, their values and priorities are reshaping the agenda.

If you deny that, you deny your heritage.</p><p>The virtue of privacy is one that must be protected in matters that are intimate and within one&#39;s own family.</p><p>The moment someone chooses to trust in Jesus Christ, his sins are wiped away, and he is adopted into God&#39;s family. That individual is set apart as a child of God, with a sacred purpose.</p><p>Left-wing politicians take away your liberty in the name of children and of fighting poverty, while right-wing politicians do it in the name of family values and fighting drugs. Either way, government gets bigger and you become less free.</p><p>The only sensible ends of literature are, first, the pleasurable toil of writing second, the gratification of one&#39;s family and friends and lastly, the solid cash.</p><p>I don&#39;t have to look up my family tree, because I know that I&#39;m the sap.</p><p>We give a lot of others significance in our lives even when they don&#39;t deserve it. It doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re family or if you&#39;ve known them forever. If they&#39;re not good for you, they&#39;ve got to go.</p><p>If you dream of something worth doing and then simply go to work on it and don&#39;t think anything of personalities, or emotional conflicts, or of money, or of family distractions it is amazing how quickly you get through those 5,000 steps.</p><p>If you have issues with family, friends, and people at work, try and solve these issues head on so you can move on and concentrate on having the life you want.</p><p>In that I found being able to talk to my family about my feelings, praying for strength and realizing that our lives have a deep purpose and the journey of our lives is to find out what that is and express it, was the only way I could have gotten through it.</p><p>Everything happens for a reason. I&#39;m used to it, I prepare for it. Like I say, at the end of the day, those in charge of their own destiny are going to do what&#39;s right for them and their family.</p><p>A family is a unit composed not only of children but of men, women, an occasional animal, and the common cold.</p><p>We are special because we&#39;ve been united not by a common race or ethnicity. We&#39;re bound together by common values. That family is the most important institution in society. That almighty God is the source of all we have.</p><p>You all know that I have been sustained throughout my life by three saving graces - my family, my friends, and a faith in the power of resilience and hope. These graces have carried me through difficult times and they have brought more joy to the good times than I ever could have imagined.</p><p>I think illness is a family journey, no matter what the outcome. Everybody has to be allowed to process it and mourn and deal with it in their own way.</p><p>God&#39;s dream is that you and I and all of us will realize that we are family, that we are made for togetherness, for goodness, and for compassion.</p><p>Your ability to communicate is an important tool in your pursuit of your goals, whether it is with your family, your co-workers or your clients and customers.</p><p>One of the greatest things drama can do, at it&#39;s best, is to redefine the words we use every day such as love, home, family, loyalty and envy. Tragedy need not be a downer.</p><p>My childhood was safe and sane. No abuse and no traumas. I was surrounded by a large and loving family who taught me the importance of hard work and a meaningful education.</p><p>I think that in a year I may retire. I cannot take my money with me when I die and I wish to enjoy it, with my family, while I live. I should prefer living in Germany to any other country, though I am an American, and am loyal to my country.</p><p>In the investigation of a neurotic style of life, we must always suspect an opponent, and note who suffers most because of the patient&#39;s condition. Usually this is a member of the family.</p><p>Getting married and starting a family has been a lifelong goal and one that I have persevered through different paths up to it!</p><p>I cannot remember a moment in my life when I have not felt the love of my family. We were a family that would have killed for each other - and we still are.</p><p>A man filled with the love of God is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race.</p><p>And I keep saying, whether you like the president or not, everybody has to pull together and help the president because, as the president goes, so goes the country, as the country goes, so goes your job, your ability to feed your family, your government.</p><p>Rather like Batman, I embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family, courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong, good and bad and justice.</p><p>Life goes by really fast, and it seems that there are times when you&#39;re burying a lot of friends and family. And then there are times that feel really precious and everybody is doing okay. This is one of those times.</p><p>The first pages of memory are like the old family Bible. The first leaves are wholly faded and somewhat soiled with handling. But, when we turn further, and come to the chapters where Adam and Eve were banished from Paradise, then, all begins to grow clear and legible.</p><p>I would prefer to have no money but to have a nice family and good friends around.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had a divorce, but I&#39;ve seen so many of my friends, my sister, my family go through that stuff, so I try to write for the people that can&#39;t write about it. I take on their sorrow, so I&#39;m able to kind of express it, or their joy.</p><p>A real hangover is nothing to try out family remedies on. The only cure for a real hangover is death.</p><p>I&#39;m surrounded by great friends and family. I don&#39;t know what I would do without them.</p><p>Love and fear. Everything the father of a family says must inspire one or the other.</p><p>In God&#39;s family, there are no outsiders, no enemies.</p><p>Family life is too intimate to be preserved by the spirit of justice. It can be sustained by a spirit of love which goes beyond justice.</p><p>Holidays are the best. I couldn&#39;t imagine being from a small family.</p><p>Everything family does is reflection on the other people.</p><p>My mother has always been the social glue holding the family together.</p><p>I always put clothes and family photos under the mattress, in case the house burns down.</p><p>I know some people say it&#39;s not the best to work with your family, but I have never understood that because it&#39;s always worked so well for me.</p><p>Since I&#39;m always working, my best holiday memories are definitely when I can just go home and spend time with my family.</p><p>I talked about my family, my family&#39;s so important.</p><p>People think I have courage. The courage in my family are my wife Pam, my three daughters, here, Nicole, Jamie, LeeAnn, my mom, who&#39;s right here too.</p><p>When we&#39;re dealing with the people in our family - no matter how annoying or gross they may be, no matter how self-inflicted their suffering may appear, no matter how afflicted they are with ignorance, prejudice or nose hairs - we give from the deepest parts of ourselves.</p><p>The breakdown of the black community, in order to maintain slavery, began with the breakdown of the black family. Men and women were not legally allowed to get married because you couldn&#39;t have that kind of love. It might get in the way of the economics of slavery. Your children could be taken from you and literally sold down the river.</p><p>We will see a breakdown of the family and family values if we decide to approve same-sex marriage, and if we decide to establish homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle with all the benefits that go with equating it with the heterosexual lifestyle.</p><p>You go through life wondering what is it all about but at the end of the day it&#39;s all about family.</p><p>The police cannot protect the citizen at this stage of our development, and they cannot even protect themselves in many cases. It is up to the private citizen to protect himself and his family, and this is not only acceptable, but mandatory.</p><p>It is the logic of consumerism that undermines the values of loyalty and permanence and promotes a different set of values that is destructive of family life.</p><p>Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate.</p><p>I&#39;ve made all my money on my own without my family and I work very hard.</p><p>I guess you could say I devoted myself so strongly to my music that for awhile I forgot about my family. But I only get one set of parents, and I think I forgot about that for a little while.</p><p>When families are strong and stable, so are children - showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes. But when things go wrong - either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship - the impact on a child&#39;s later life can be devastating.</p><p>In the past 40 years, the United States lost more than a million farmers and ranchers. Many of our farmers are aging. Today, only nine percent of family farm income comes from farming, and more and more of our farmers are looking elsewhere for their primary source of income.</p><p>See, that&#39;s why Barack&#39;s running: to end the war in Iraq responsibly - to build an economy that lifts every family, to make sure health care is available for every American - and to make sure that every child in this nation has a world-class education all the way from preschool to college.</p><p>It all starts with the script: it&#39;s not worth taking myself away from my family if I don&#39;t have something I&#39;m really passionate about.</p><p>Historically, the family has played the primary role in educating children for life, with the school providing supplemental scaffolding to the family.</p><p>I did commit to myself that I would not jump back into being the workaholic that I can be before I gave myself an honest opportunity to create the marriage of my dreams and to create the beginning of the family of my dreams, and that took a hot second.</p><p>You know, my family and friends have never been yes-men: &#39;Yes, you&#39;re doing the right thing, you&#39;re always right.&#39; No, they tell me when I&#39;m wrong, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been able to stay who I am and stay humble.</p><p>Children in a family are like flowers in a bouquet: there&#39;s always one determined to face in an opposite direction from the way the arranger desires.</p><p>The CIA is made up of boys whose families sent them to Princeton but wouldn&#39;t let them into the family brokerage business.</p><p>There&#39;s a schizoid streak within the family anyway so I dare say that I&#39;m affected by that. The majority of the people in my family have been in some kind of mental institution, as for my brother he doesn&#39;t want to leave. He likes it very much.</p><p>Let your family, staff, and friends know that you&#39;re still the same person, despite all the publicity and notoriety that accompanies your position.</p><p>I come from a family of very devout, praying people. That idea of peace and love toward humanity shouldn&#39;t be nationalistic or denominational. It should be a chief concern for all mankind.</p><p>What people don&#39;t understand is joining a gang ain&#39;t bad, it&#39;s cool, it&#39;s fine. When you in the hood, joining a gang it&#39;s cool because all your friends are in the gang, all your family&#39;s in the gang. We&#39;re not just killing people every night, we&#39;re just hanging out, having a good time.</p><p>I am not generous about telling people who I am and what I like to do because it&#39;s my life and it only belongs to me and my friends and family.</p><p>Love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man&#39;s starving!</p><p>I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world, in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family. No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist - although the term had not reached Chile yet, so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.</p><p>I am healthy, my family is healthy. That is the important thing. After that we go racing.</p><p>I realised how paranoid and guarded and not trusting - walled-in - I had become. Not consciously so, but just this armour that I kind of have, protective armour. It&#39;s not for my friends or family, but for being.outside in the world, always on guard.</p><p>I&#39;m a girl from a good family who was very well brought up. One day I turned my back on it all and became a bohemian.</p><p>Everybody has basically the same family, it&#39;s just reconfigured slightly differently from one to the next.</p><p>Together, we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy, healthy choice.</p><p>I missed my home - like the physicality of my home, I missed my friends and my family mostly and just hanging out and being in your home country - culturally it feels right and that is what I miss.</p><p>Leave the President&#39;s family business to him. You will have plenty to do without trying to manage the First Family. They are likely to do fine without your help.</p><p>For the Nugent family, fast food is a running herbivore.</p><p>But with the steady disintegration of the family in modern society over the last century, the role of the school in bridging the gap has become vital!</p><p>I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker, put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table. But she taught me as I walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start, but where you&#39;re going. That&#39;s family values.</p><p>And when I was young, my family was perfectly nice. I write a lot about it, as you noticed. But it was rather limited. I think, I don&#39;t think anyone in my family would really feel I&#39;d done them an injustice by saying that. We didn&#39;t see many people. There were many books. It was as if I wanted to get away from home.</p><p>Like family, we are tied to each other. This is what all good musicians understand.</p><p>My parents were French and Irish and our family even has Spanish blood-and I do so love the United States and consider myself part American.</p><p>I just want my family to be safe. Because I am sometimes polarizing, I fear for their safety.</p><p>People under the influence of cults is similar to that we observe in addicts. Typical behaviour for both includes draining bank accounts, neglecting children, destroying relations with family and losing interest in anything except the drug or cult.</p><p>The question of the family now divides our society so deeply that the opposing sides cannot even agree on a definition of the institution they are arguing about.</p><p>My family got all over me because they said Bush is only for the rich people. Then I reminded them, &#39;Hey, I&#39;m rich&#39;.</p><p>There can be hope only for a society which acts as one big family, not as many separate ones.</p><p>My kids say if there&#39;s any family dinner that doesn&#39;t result in somebody crying, it&#39;s not a good dinner. They cry because it helps relieve them of a guilt or some onerous emotional burden. It&#39;s like a family tradition.</p><p>Growing up in a particular neighborhood, growing up in a working-class family, not having much money, all of those things fire you and can give you an edge, can give you an anger.</p><p>I&#39;m healthy, have a loving and adorable family, great hunting dogs, a gravity defying musical career and most importantly, fuzzy-headed idiots hate me.</p><p>Do it no matter what. If you believe in it, it is something very honorable. If somebody around you or your family does not understand it, then that&#39;s their problem. But if you do have a passion, an honest passion, just do it.</p><p>Because I didn&#39;t have brothers, I was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family, so I became one of them - but it was not my family. I&#39;ve always been attracted to temporary families. They tend to be lost characters.</p><p>Woman is the salvation or the destruction of the family. She carries its destiny in the folds of her mantle.</p><p>I love when I go out and I have my hair and makeup done, but I also like it when I&#39;m just with the family because that&#39;s real.</p><p>In five years&#39; time I&#39;d like to be a mum. I want to settle down and have a family, definitely sooner rather than later. I&#39;d like to have finished my second album too, maybe even my third. I&#39;d like a sound that sticks around that other people are inspired by and that people know is me.</p><p>My mom is the backbone not just of my family but of many families.</p><p>Family&#39;s first, and that&#39;s what matters most. We realize that our love goes deeper than the tennis game.</p><p>I&#39;m thankful to my family, friends, and fans for all of their support.</p><p>Over the last couple of years, I&#39;ve really worked toward balancing my life out more, having a little bit more time with friends, family and my boyfriend. There was a period of time when they were way down the list. It was all about music and touring and if everything fell by the wayside, so be it.</p><p>It is time to return to core values, time to get back to basics , to self-discipline and respect for the law, to consideration for the others, to accepting responsibility for yourself and your family - and not shuffling it off on other people and the state.</p><p>There&#39;s a bond among a kitchen staff, I think. You spend more time with your chef in the kitchen than you do with your own family.</p><p>I really love being alive. I love my family and my work. I love the opportunity I have to do things. That&#39;s what happiness is.</p><p>The true poet for me is a priest. As soon as he dons the cassock, he must leave his family.</p><p>The only people that you really have, that I learned, are your family, because they love you no matter what.</p><p>When I do get the chance I just love to hang around at home with friends and family.</p><p>Women are, in my view, natural peacemakers. As givers and nurturers of life, through their focus on human relationships and their engagement with the demanding work of raising children and protecting family life, they develop a deep sense of empathy that cuts through to underlying human realities.</p><p>A family on the throne is an interesting idea. It brings down the pride of sovereignty to the level of petty life.</p><p>One thing that was passed on from generation to generation in my family, over seven generations in 200 years, was never give up. That&#39;s the way we live.</p><p>Protecting the institution of marriage safeguards, I believe, the American family.</p><p>I know I&#39;m talented, but I wasn&#39;t put here to sing. I was put here to be a wife and a mom and look after my family. I love what I do, but it&#39;s not where it begins and ends.</p><p>The steady expansion of welfare programs can be taken as a measure of the steady disintegration of the Negro family structure over the past generation in the United States.</p><p>I came from a poor family, so working and going to school at the same time was natural. It taught me multi-tasking, although we didn&#39;t call it that back then. I learned I could never be idle, I need to be doing many things at once.</p><p>Every adolescent has that dream every century has that dream every revolutionary has that dream, to destroy the family.</p><p>The greenest home is the one you don&#39;t build. If you really want to save the Earth, move in with another family and share a house that&#39;s already built. Better yet, live in the forest and eat whatever the squirrels don&#39;t want.</p><p>I&#39;m a teenager, but I&#39;m independent - I have my own apartment, I have my own life. And I think I have learned more than any of those teenagers have in school. I learned to be responsible, leaving my family and coming here alone.</p><p>It&#39;s hard enough to work and raise a family when your kids are all healthy and relatively normal, but when you add on some kind of disability or disease, it can just be such a burden.</p><p>When you look at Prince Charles, don&#39;t you think that someone in the Royal family knew someone in the Royal family?</p><p>The follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family, their friends, people who should be supportive going, &#39;What are you talking about?&#39; Even just seemingly regular career paths, but if it&#39;s not what people expect for you they kind of react funny.</p><p>When you live on the road, going home is a place to escape and just be with your family to unwind.</p><p>I am just happy to be part of the Nike family.</p><p>I don&#39;t see how the party that says it&#39;s the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century.</p><p>Going home and spending time with your family and your real friends keeps you grounded.</p><p>A family&#39;s photograph album is generally about the extended family and, often, is all that remains of it.</p><p>I had to learn my faith and look after my family, and I had to make priorities. But now I&#39;ve done it all and there&#39;s a little space for me to fill in the universe of music again.</p><p>We must not allow the liberals to move us away from the conservative values of the American past which sustain our present and shall secure our future. As for me and my family, we will serve God, we will serve this constitutional republic, we will serve America.</p><p>And so I look at it as a relationship that I have with him that I want to give him the honor and glory anytime I have the opportunity. And then right after I give him the honor and glory, I always try to give my teammates the honor and glory. And that&#39;s how it works because Christ comes first in my life, and then my family, and then my teammates.</p><p>Being a Barrymore didn&#39;t help me, other than giving me a great sense of pride and a strange spiritual sense that I felt OK about having the passion to act. It made sense because my whole family had done it and it helped rationalise it for me.</p><p>I grew up in a family that was multifaceted, sexually oriented, and pretty much open to everything. And because I was working, my friends were all adults. I had a tough time going to different schools because people knew me from films and I was the fat child who got beaten up every day.</p><p>I really have created a family. I work with the people I love, I travel with them, I make films with them, and I&#39;m in an office with them. So in a weird way - I know I haven&#39;t birthed a child - I feel that I&#39;m a part of creating a family. It&#39;s a tribe. I love that word.</p><p>When I did &#39;E.T.,&#39; it sort of solidified the only family I know are these film crews. These gypsies. These filmmakers. That was the solidification and the clicking revelations of &#39;This is what I want to do with my life and this is where I&#39;m going to survive.&#39;</p><p>I want to make sure my family&#39;s straight.</p><p>If you have issues with family, friends, and people at work, try and solve these issues head on so you can move on and concentrate on having the life you want. Think about what you can do so that you are happy with yourself - for instance, eating right to feel great and energetic.</p><p>My family isn&#39;t really all that different from anyone else&#39;s. Well, maybe they&#39;re a bit more entertaining.</p><p>My other family is Fleetwood Mac. I don&#39;t need the money, but there&#39;s an emotional need for me to go on the road again. There&#39;s a love there we&#39;re a band of brothers.</p><p>Look, I think Hispanic community - the values that resonate in our community are fundamentally conservative. They are faith, family and patriotism.</p><p>As a child, the family that I had and the love I had from my two parents allowed me to go ahead and be more aggressive, to search and to take risks knowing that, if I failed, I could always come home to a family of love and support.</p><p>I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart.</p><p>I bought a lot of rubbish things that kids buy: skateboards and clothes and typical teenage stuff. And, as soon as I could, I wasted a lot of money on cars - BMW&#39;s mostly - for myself and my family.</p><p>It is awesome to feel you are carrying on the family name.</p><p>My inspiration was my mom. She&#39;s a great cook, and she still cooks, and we still banter back and forth about cooking. Growing up in a mostly Portuguese community, food was important and the family table was extremely important. At a very young age I understood that.</p><p>I feel akin to the Platypus. An orphan in a family. A swimmer, a recluse. Part bird, part fish, part lizard.</p><p>I think the American Dream says that anything can happen if you work hard enough at it and are persistent, and have some ability. The sky is the limit to what you can build, and what can happen to you and your family.</p><p>The lover of life makes the whole world into his family, just as the lover of the fair sex creates his from all the lovely women he has found, from those that could be found, and those who are impossible to find.</p><p>I am so excited to let fans in on how important my relationship with my family is to me. I hope to motivate mothers and daughters to build lifetimes of memories together and inspire kids around the world to live their dreams.</p><p>My family really does come first. It always did and always will.</p><p>Men have looked upon the desert as barren land, the free holding of whoever chose but in fact each hill and valley in it had a man who was its acknowledged owner and would quickly assert the right of his family or clan to it, against aggression.</p><p>It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen, but it&#39;s a family thing, and I guess it&#39;s clean.</p><p>Family and friends and faith are the most important things in your life and you should be building friendships.</p><p>You know sit with your arm around a little kid and read. It not only teaches them to read but it keeps the family strong.</p><p>I don&#39;t think a female running a house is a problem, a broken family. It&#39;s perceived as one because of the notion that a head is a man.</p><p>I want to be a young dad. By 25 or 26 I want to see myself, like, married or start looking for a family.</p><p>I like to be judged by my family and friends because they know me.</p><p>I come from a very non-accepting family, but I&#39;m very accepting.</p><p>I grew up not really having anything, so the idea that I can take care of my family and my friends now is a really cool bonus.</p><p>When you live in an alcoholic family or an abusive family, you tiptoe, you don&#39;t want to step on any mines.</p><p>America&#39;s a family. We all yell at each other. It all works out.</p><p>The blues was like that problem child that you may have had in the family. You was a little bit ashamed to let anybody see him, but you loved him. You just didn&#39;t know how other people would take it.</p><p>I have a very good family. I&#39;m very fortunate to have a very good family. I believe very strongly in the family. It&#39;s one of the things we have in our platform, is to talk about it.</p><p>It did remind me of something out of Greek mythology - the richest king who gets everything he wants, but ultimately his family has a curse on it from the Gods.</p><p>The fact that food plays such an important part in my films has everything to do with my family.</p><p>A lot of what I&#39;m obsessed with is the relationship and the dynamics between people and the family, particularly brothers and their father.</p><p>But I also want to have a family with children one day, which is very important to me.</p><p>With a family of six, there is always something to make, create and do together.</p><p>Sure, climbing Mount Everest would be cool, but that&#39;s something I would now like to do as a family. Big experiences like that I don&#39;t want to have on my own anymore. I want to share them.</p><p>Family comes first. You&#39;re the only thing they have.</p><p>I&#39;m not a kid. You don&#39;t get in this business for anonymity. It&#39;s not like I have posters of myself on the wall, but at the same time, I&#39;m kind of ready for a little bit of it, but I worry for my little one, and my family - their privacy. That&#39;s what I&#39;m more protective of.</p><p>My parents were drawn to the idea that there was space and opportunity in Australia. For the meagre sum of &amp;pound10, you could sail your entire family out to Australia, so that&#39;s what my father chose to do.</p><p>My family, my parents are hippies.</p><p>I enjoy what I&#39;m able to give my family.</p><p>My family&#39;s lineage is five generations of artists who never made it.</p><p>Personal sins should not require press releases and problems within a family shouldn&#39;t have to mean public confessions.</p><p>I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves.</p><p>I hurt my wife, my kids, my mother, my wife&#39;s family, my friends, my foundation and kids all around the world who admired me.</p><p>I get 0.5 seconds to react to a ball, sometimes even less than that. I can&#39;t be thinking of what XYZ has said about me. I need to surrender myself to my natural instincts. My subconscious mind knows exactly what to do. It is trained to react. At home, my family doesn&#39;t discuss media coverage.</p><p>My ultimate life dream project is my kids. My family.</p><p>I remember driving to North Carolina when I was a little girl in a snowstorm to get down to my mom&#39;s family in the Carolinas. There were chains on the car - it was the late sixties - and we were just singing in the car. Christmas carols.</p><p>The principal contributor to loneliness in this country is television. What happens is that the family &#39;gets together&#39; alone.</p><p>I can&#39;t tell you how scary it can be walking onto a movie and suddenly joining this family, it&#39;s like going to somebody else&#39;s Christmas dinner, everyone knows everyone, and you&#39;re there and you&#39;re not quite sure what you&#39;re supposed to be doing.</p><p>No doubt, the White House thinks the American people know Obama&#39;s story. But since the Inauguration, we&#39;ve seen only the president&#39;s present: his perfect family, his Ivy League elegance, his effortless mastery of complex issues. We never see him sweat. And we forget that he ever had to struggle.</p><p>One, if you attack my integrity, I will defend myself. If you attack my patriotism, I will defend myself. If you come after my family, I will counter-attack viciously, I will destroy you.</p><p>But if each man could have his own house, a large garden to cultivate and healthy surroundings - then, I thought, there will be for them a better opportunity of a happy family life.</p><p>A home is crucial, the foundation of a stable family.</p><p>I&#39;m a strong person, I&#39;m a strong family man, I&#39;m a strong husband and a strong father.</p><p>My mom has made it possible for me to be who I am. Our family is everything. Her greatest skill was encouraging me to find my own person and own independence.</p><p>Acting is just a way of making a living, the family is life.</p><p>I&#39;m from a lower middle class background all my family were immigrants.</p><p>In my particular instance, I came from a family that didn&#39;t have anything. Everything I earned in life I made. Myself. With songs that I wrote.</p><p>At a family&#39;s most difficult time, I want to make sure at a minimum that they have the very basic of comforts: the ability to grieve their loss privately and the knowledge that their country is grateful for their loved one&#39;s sacrifice and service.</p><p>If you want to see mankind fully, look at a family. Within the family minds become organically one, and for this reason the family is total poetry.</p><p>I had a really wonderful upbringing. We were a tight family. It was wonderful to grow up with so many siblings. We were all just a year or two apart, and we were always so supportive of each other. I learned everything from my older brother and sister and taught it to my younger sisters.</p><p>I need my family to remind me in a loving and nice way to lighten up.</p><p>I have to make it my job to be careful with my family.</p><p>My wife, my family, my friends - they&#39;ve all taught me things about love and what that emotion really means. In a nutshell, loving someone is about giving, not receiving.</p><p>My dad would give me $10, which is a lot of money when you&#39;re 9, to sing at church, on tables at restaurants, at family functions, just about anywhere.</p><p>Santa Barbara is my hood. I mean, it&#39;s not much of a hood, but it is definitely like my hood. I claim Santa Barbara like I claim my family. I&#39;m going to be married and buried there.</p><p>The family only represents one aspect, however important an aspect, of a human being&#39;s functions and activities. A life is beautiful and ideal or the reverse, only when we have taken into our consideration the social as well as the family relationship.</p><p>I come from a great family. I&#39;ve seen family life and I know how wonderful, how nurturing, and how wonderful it can be.</p><p>We will invest in our people, quality education, job opportunity, family, neighborhood, and yes, a thing we call America.</p><p>Too often, older women are seen as victims, but I know lots of formidable women who have marvellous jobs as well as a full erotic life, and children and friends and family.</p><p>I love where I&#39;m from. I don&#39;t live there because of the circumstances, but all my family is there. It&#39;s what&#39;s inside, it&#39;s not what&#39;s outside that determines the culture and the feeling.</p><p>Our notion of the perfect society embraces the family as its center and ornament, and this paradise is not secure until children appear to animate and complete the picture.</p><p>I play with my grandchildren. I tend to my garden, which I love. Of course, I love to read, and family is really what it&#39;s all about.</p><p>I draw from my family and my friends and I feel like that small-town person. The achievements, the materialistic possessions have really become to mean less. They mean nothing.</p><p>I am hoping that in this year of the family we will go into our families and reconcile differences.</p><p>I did come from a pretty independent-minded family.</p><p>I think my father would have liked to have been an artist, actually. But I think he didn&#39;t quite have perhaps the drive or, I don&#39;t know, I mean he had a family to bring up I suppose.</p><p>I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family it says they&#39;re looting, if you see a white family it says they&#39;re looking for food.</p><p>There are just so many stories that are buried on family trees.</p><p>I do not see my family life in any way, shape, or form as an opportunity for a photo.</p><p>My mother, at least twice, cancelled our family&#39;s subscription to the newspaper I was working on, because she was so mad about its treatment of my father.</p><p>As they say in Italy, Italians were eating with a knife and fork when the French were still eating each other. The Medici family had to bring their Tuscan cooks up there so they could make something edible.</p><p>Having family responsibilities and concerns just has to make you a more understanding person.</p><p>A retired teacher paid $62,000 towards her pension and nothing, yes nothing, for full family medical, dental and vision coverage over her entire career. What will we pay her? $1.4 million in pension benefits and another $215,000 in health care benefit premiums over her lifetime.</p><p>For the first time ever I was taking the family on the road. We stayed with my in-laws, which on life&#39;s list of experiences ranks right below sitting in a tub full of scissors.</p><p>There is an overwhelming amount of information available to us all on the web each day, not to mention what is shared with us by our family, friends, fans, and followers. This necessitates the need to filter through all that information and to decide for ourselves where to put our attention.</p><p>I love my friends and family, but I also love it when they can&#39;t find me and I can spend all day reading or walking all alone, in silence, eight thousand miles away from everyone. All alone and unreachable in a foreign country is one my most favorite possible things to be.</p><p>They say Yogi Berra is funny. Well, he has a lovely wife and family, a beautiful home, money in the bank, and he plays golf with millionaires. What&#39;s funny about that?</p><p>I&#39;m thankful for all the things that this job has given me and my family. But probably the thing that I am most proud of throughout my career is that, not only myself, but my family and the people around me have just been regular people, which we are.</p><p>I do believe at the end of the night when you&#39;re with your family, the character gets hung up on the door like a coat, and is there to be taken on the next morning.</p><p>There&#39;s an honesty in our family - my kids and I are able to talk about things without me putting the fear of God into them.</p><p>You cannot be happy with your family while being personally unhappy with your work. It&#39;s a Catch-22 kind of thing.</p><p>Because of my own family&#39;s service (in the U.S. Army, Navy, and Massachusetts and New York National Guard), I am a strong supporter of the military and do believe that there are just wars.</p><p>Except for naval and air exercises, our military should be stationed on American soil, where service men and women can lead normal lives in close proximity to family and friends.</p><p>I want to do as little as possible when I finish playing ball - just spend a lot more time with my family.</p><p>I know it&#39;s a cliche, but the whole family is just whacked. I mean, we&#39;re all out of our minds. They&#39;re the funniest, most eccentric bizarre people I&#39;ve ever met, my siblings.</p><p>Only solitary men know the full joys of frienship. Others have their family but to a solitary and an exile, his friends are everything.</p><p>Parenthood and family come first for me, and when I&#39;m not working I&#39;m cool with the Teletubbies.</p><p>Studies have shown that since women have had access to the pill and family planning measures, they have made huge gains in both wages and in careers that were dominated by men.</p><p>For families across the UK who are income-poor, but more than that, whose lives are blighted by worklessness, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt and poor health, as well as other problems, giving them an extra pound - say through increased benefits - will not address the reason they find themselves in difficulty in the first place.</p><p>Mental illness is the last frontier. The gay thing is part of everyday life now on a show like &#39;Modern Family,&#39; but mental illness is still full of stigma. Maybe it is time for that to change.</p><p>If anything interferes with my inner peace, I will walk away. Arguments with family members. All that stuff. None of it matters.</p><p>It is no longer an unwritten law of American capitalism that industry will attempt to maintain wages at a level that allows a single wage to support a family.</p><p>The family wage has been eroded by the same developments that have promoted consumerism as a way of life.</p><p>In a big family the first child is kind of like the first pancake. If it&#39;s not perfect, that&#39;s okay, there are a lot more coming along.</p><p>I&#39;m worried about that man or woman sitting around - the coffee table tonight or in their kitchen talking about how are we going to get to work. How are we going to have the dignity to take care of our family.</p><p>I have been called a nun with a switchblade where my privacy is concerned. I think there&#39;s a point where one says, that&#39;s for family, that&#39;s for me.</p><p>My sense of the family history is somewhat sketchy, because my mother kept a great deal to herself.</p><p>Never refuse an assignment except when there is a conflict of interest, a potential of danger to you or your family, or you hold a strongly biased attitude about the subject under focus.</p><p>The last thing family and friends want is for you to spend money on them that you don&#39;t have or that you can&#39;t really spare.</p><p>I believe there are three keys to success. For me it is keeping my priorities in order: It&#39;s my faith and my family, and then the business.</p><p>My friends ask me why I still live with my family, but I feel comfortable there. We&#39;ve all been through so much together.</p><p>I know my family and I would always go up to the mountains just for fun. We always skied. Then, all of a sudden, my brother started snow boarding. Older brother thing, I had to do what he was doing. So I started snow boarding.</p><p>I sang in the choir for years, even though my family belonged to another church.</p><p>My father was the center of the family, and everyone tried to please him.</p><p>Thinking back to those earlier days, I felt I was weak when I wasn&#39;t making movies, and then when I was, I thought I was weak as a family member.</p><p>Soon we saw that money going to women brought much more benefit to the family than money going to the men. So we changed our policy and gave a high priority to women. As a result, now 96% of our four million borrowers in Grameen Bank are women.</p><p>The first responsibility of the Muslim is as teacher. That is his job, to teach. His first school, his first classroom is within the household. His first student is himself. He masters himself and then he begins to convey the knowledge that he has acquired to the family. The people who are closest to him.</p><p>I come from a family of losers, and I&#39;ve rejected my family as something I don&#39;t want to be like.</p><p>I have an obligation to try to live as long as I can for my family.</p><p>My goal is to get everybody in America to do their family tree.</p><p>If you share a common ancestor with somebody, you&#39;re related to them. It doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re going to invite them to the family reunion, but it means that you share DNA.</p><p>If you share a common ancestor with somebody, you&#39;re related to them. It doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re going to invite them to the family reunion, but it means that you share DNA. I think it&#39;s fascinating.</p><p>The bottom line is that Wanda Sykes has the longest continuously documented family tree of any African-American we have ever researched.</p><p>My family and our neighbors and friends thought of Africa and its Africans as extensions of the stereotyped characters that we saw in movies and on television in films such as &#39;Tarzan&#39; and in programs such as &#39;Ramar of the Jungle&#39; and &#39;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.&#39;</p><p>You can say I had a severe case of &#39;Roots&#39; envy. I wanted to be like Alex Haley, and I wanted to be able to... do my family tree back to the slave ship and then reverse the Middle Passage, as I like to put it, and find the tribe or ethnic group that I was from in Africa.</p><p>So when you do your family tree and Margaret Cho does hers, and... Wanda Sykes and John Legend... we&#39;re adding to the database that scholars can then draw from to generalize about the complexity of the American experience. And that&#39;s the contribution that family trees make to broader scholarship.</p><p>The death of any man aged 56 is very sad for his widow and family. And no one would deny that Steve Jobs was a brilliant and highly innovative technician, with great business flair and marketing ability.</p><p>It seems to me that unless you or someone very close to you has had a bad head injury, you really can&#39;t fathom it. You have no concept of what it is all about. It was so difficult for my whole family, not just me.</p><p>Seeing the family is a very important part of my weekend.</p><p>I come from an Italian family. One of the greatest and most profound expressions we would ever use in conversations or arguments was a slamming door. The slamming door was our punctuation mark.</p><p>You follow any family around, you&#39;re going to see elation, you&#39;re going to see disharmony.</p><p>The family teaches us about the importance of knowledge, education, hard work and effort. It teaches us about enjoying ourselves, having fun, keeping fit and healthy.</p><p>Only as far as a man is happily married to himself is he fit for married life and family life in general.</p><p>I have had lots of friends who&#39;ve been affected by Aids and a very good friend of mine, Oscar Moore, died of Aids and I was with him in his last year quite a bit. And of course he was a man living in a very rich culture with a wealthy family who was able to afford health care.</p><p>I understand what it&#39;s like to come with your family, and to uproot yourself and come to another culture. You need a lot of support. People say, &#39;She&#39;s got her daughter she&#39;s got her husband.&#39; Yeah, but she hasn&#39;t got anyone else.</p><p>The real estate agent had to go door-to-door in the apartment building we wanted to rent, asking if it was OK for this interracial family - my mom is white and I was a 1-year-old half-African kid - to live in the apartment building.</p><p>The Rooneys are very classy. They&#39;re very deliberate with their decision-making. Once you&#39;re part of that family, Steeler nation, they treat you with respect. You don&#39;t have a lot of rambunctious players running around.</p><p>In every song I write, whether it&#39;s a love song or a political song or a song about family, the one thing that I find is feeling lost and trying to find your way.</p><p>I wanted the players to feel like they were part of a family, to be conscious of that controlled togetherness as they made that slow entrance onto the field. It had a great psychological effect on the opposing team, too. They&#39;d never seen anything like it.</p><p>I now have two different audiences. There&#39;s the one that has been watching my action films for 20 years, and the American family audience. American jokes, less fighting.</p><p>No one can find inner peace except by working, not in a self- centered way, but for the whole human family.</p><p>My grandfather&#39;s family used to own a pasta factory in Naples and they would go door-to-door selling their pasta. So his love of food came from his parents, which was then passed down to my mother and then again to me.</p><p>I work more now because at this time of my life I am not disturbed from my aim by outside pressures such as family, passionate relationships, dealing with &#39;who am I?&#39; - those complications when one is searching for one&#39;s self.</p><p>I have yet to see a drama that puts forward women who are successful and have a family. Women are nearly always seen as victims.</p><p>Like all best families, we have our share of eccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of family disagreements.</p><p>I&#39;m often asked if I regret not going to Hollywood. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t go, because if I had I wouldn&#39;t have my extended family, which is the fabric of my life. Only recently have I realised how special and unusual it is.</p><p>I have yet to see a drama that puts forward women who are successful and also have a family... they are nearly always seen as victims.</p><p>Music was your real passion, this thing you held dear even above family. It was this relationship that never betrayed you. Once it became your job - this thing that was highly visible, this thing that became about commerce - that&#39;s when you were holding onto music like it was a palm tree in a hurricane.</p><p>A ball player has to be kept hungry to become a big leaguer. That&#39;s why no boy from a rich family has ever made the big leagues.</p><p>For those who are able to work, work has to be seen as the best route out of poverty. For work is not just about more money - it is transformative. It&#39;s about taking responsibility for yourself and your family.</p><p>I&#39;d like to have a family.</p><p>Whenever I have friends over, we end up eating and talking and losing track of time, and, once in a while, singing karaoke. It reminds me of the family meals we had in Russia, which always lasted a very long time. That&#39;s a tradition I miss.</p><p>My family and I built my whole career from scratch.</p><p>My family is awesome.</p><p>I support concrete and progressive immigration reform based on three primary criteria: family reunification, economic contributions, and humanitarian concerns.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine dating a boy, meeting him only outside the home. What&#39;s a home and family for if it&#39;s not the center of one&#39;s life?</p><p>My wife, a schoolteacher, very disciplined. If you think I&#39;m tough, trust me, and wait till you see when the children are on the naughty step. It&#39;s hilarious. So we decided that I&#39;m going to work like a donkey and provide amazing support for the family.</p><p>The dirty little secret is that the pool man, who&#39;s making $30,000 a year, is subsidizing the million-dollar mortgage for the family whose pool he cleans. No wonder people want to get rid of tax breaks for corporate jets.</p><p>My father, who died a few years ago, was a good, simple, very honest man. His faith and affection for his family was just unassailable, without question.</p><p>You go to a restaurant in the States and kids have these game boards at the table. You don&#39;t see that in Italy or Spain. It&#39;s not because they can&#39;t afford to buy them, it&#39;s because that&#39;s not what eating together as a family is about.</p><p>Stay out of the sun, because it is the worst thing in terms of aging. I&#39;m very medical. I come from a medical family.</p><p>I don&#39;t hide my feelings, but when it comes to illness, I guess I don&#39;t panic. My father was the same way. I&#39;m the provider for the family and the caretaker. If I panic, who is anybody going to run to?</p><p>If you don&#39;t have public hangings for bad culture in a company, if you don&#39;t take people out and let them say, they went home to spend more time with the family. It&#39;s crazy.</p><p>I am suspending my presidential campaign, because of the continued distractions, the continued hurt caused on me and my family, not because we are not fighters. Not because I&#39;m not a fighter.</p><p>That&#39;s a central part of philosophy, of ethics. What do I owe to strangers? What do I owe to my family? What is it to live a good life? Those are questions which we face as individuals.</p><p>Catholic school graduates exhibit a wide variety of qualities that will not only help them in their careers but also in their family and community lives.</p><p>I grew up in a Navy family.</p><p>We were never a family that had a lot. We had enough, but not a lot.</p><p>Growing up in an Italian family, you use a harsh tone and 10 minutes later everybody forgets about it.</p><p>Family life was wonderful. The streets were bleak. The playgrounds were bleak. But home was always warm. My mother and father had a great relationship. I always felt &#39;safe&#39; there.</p><p>Fundamentalists are panicked by the apparent disintegration of the family, the disappearance of certainty and the decay of morality. Fear leads them to ask, if we cannot trust the Bible, what can we trust?</p><p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society. It follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else.</p><p>There&#39;s something about being with a group of people who become like family that must be needed in society.</p><p>In Turkey, you&#39;re not allowed to be left alone in the hospital. The nurse teaches the family how to do things, and somebody is always there with the patient.</p><p>Young actors often don&#39;t think of the consequences of doing nudity or sex scenes. They want the role so badly that they agree to be exploited, and then end up embarrassing family, friends, and even strangers.</p><p>I just want to be healthy and stay alive and keep my family going and everything and keep my friends going and try to do something so that this world will be peaceful. That is the most ambitious and the most difficult thing, but I&#39;m there trying to do it.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to give birth to someone to have a family.</p><p>I grew up in a family where the women were just nuts. They didn&#39;t stand around in cardigans making polite conversation while they chopped tomatoes.</p><p>I am very lucky, I have a very tight group of friends and a very supportive family, and to this date no-one has ever sold a story on me.</p><p>I&#39;m lucky to have family around me. Otherwise, I&#39;ll be taking the risk of falling in love with myself.</p><p>I want to apologize to all of the people I have let down because of my behavior which has reflected badly on my family, friends, co-workers, business associates and others.</p><p>Women know what men have long forgotten. The ultimate economic and spiritual unit of any civilization is still the family.</p><p>The Bible is the great family chronicle of the Jews.</p><p>Even if you plan a marriage and a family, you are never quite prepared for the reality versus how you imagined it. In a lot of ways it&#39;s better, and in a lot of ways it&#39;s worse. That&#39;s life, right?</p><p>But when you lose a family member or something tragic happens, that stays with you forever. You never get over it. Knowing that you have to deal with that for the rest of your life... Football is important, but not as important as you once thought it was.</p><p>Doing Saturday Night Live definitely affects my relationship with my girlfriend and with my family, because you feel so much pressure to do well that night. But I think everyone&#39;s grown to accept that and so they give me my space at the show.</p><p>We have a president who stole the presidency through family ties, arrogance and intimidation, employing Republican operatives to exercise the tactics of voter fraud by disenfranchising thousands of blacks, elderly Jews and other minorities.</p><p>By the time I was 30, nobody would work with me. I was friendless, I was hopeless, I was suicidal, lost my family - I mean, it was bad. Bottomed out, didn&#39;t know what I was going to do. I actually thought I was going to be a chef - go to work in a kitchen someplace.</p><p>Never write an advertisement which you wouldn&#39;t want your family to read. You wouldn&#39;t tell lies to your own wife. Don&#39;t tell them to mine.</p><p>Growing up, I was taught that a man has to defend his family. When the wolf is trying to get in, you gotta stand in the doorway.</p><p>What I got which was unusual, especially as a child actress, was parents who believed that Hollywood was not that important. They told us education, family, health, all come first and they meant it.</p><p>All my freakouts have been pretty private and directed at family pets and/or people I have been dating for too short a time to freak out at in that way.</p><p>I think the family movie is very important to everybody right now.</p><p>I&#39;m getting older now, so I should think about a family, but certainly not tomorrow.</p><p>I&#39;m less worried about accomplishment - as younger people always can&#39;t help but be - and more concerned with spending my time well, spending time with my family, and reading, learning things.</p><p>If you see a black family, it&#39;s looting, but if it&#39;s a white family they are looking for food.</p><p>My own mother always taught me that fairness was a family value - I think equal pay is about fairness for everyone.</p><p>I always tried to do things by example, even though I was not a very good mother regarding routines and family life.</p><p>Being rich is a good thing. Not just in the obvious sense of benefitting you and your family, but in the broader sense. Profits are not a zero sum game. The more you make, the more of a financial impact you can have.</p><p>People had this image of the Jacksons as the perfect American family and I destroyed that image. But what people have to understand is writing that book was very healing for me.</p><p>I married him because he told me it was the only way he could protect me. If we were just manager and client, my family could do whatever they wanted to get me back, but if I was his wife, they couldn&#39;t.</p><p>I can&#39;t say it&#39;s not painful being estranged from most of my family. I wish it could be otherwise.</p><p>Outside of being home with my family, I prefer a crowd.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had a very closely connected family. My parents split up when I was young and I was living with my mom for a little while, then I was kind of just on my own really young. It wasn&#39;t some kind of global tragedy, it was just never really a very close-knit family. So there was support in the sense that they didn&#39;t stand in my way.</p><p>AP promoted me to the White House beat because I knew Clinton, his family, friends, and staff better than anybody in the national press corps. Those contacts helped me break a few stories and get my career in Washington jump-started.</p><p>We all wish we could be in more than one place at the same time. People with families feel guilty all the time-if we spend too much time with our family, we feel we&#39;re not working hard enough.</p><p>You know, every family and every business in California knows what it means to go through tough times.</p><p>I was one those kids who had books on them. Before weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, funerals and anything else where you&#39;re actually meant to not be reading, my family would frisk me and take the book away. If they didn&#39;t find it by this point in the procedure, I would be sitting over in that corner completely unnoticed just reading my book.</p><p>A growing awareness of the depth of popular attachment to the family has led some liberals to concede that family is not just a buzzword for reaction.</p><p>When you look at a family, if you have a family that never interacts with each other, never has strong conversation with each other, never has disagreements, nine times out of ten you have a very cold family and they&#39;re not going to be, at the end, they&#39;re not going to be close.</p><p>I don&#39;t have a saviour or a royal family.</p><p>Most Evangelicals claim to be politically non-partisan, and say they only identify with the Republican Party because the Republicans are committed to &#39;family values.&#39;</p><p>I, for one, am quite willing to join the &#39;forgive, forget and move on&#39; crowd, but it does make me wonder if Evangelicals are going to sound believable when they say that they tend to vote Republican because of their religious commitments to the family.</p><p>The traditional spokespersons for the Evangelicals, such as Chuck Colson and James Dobson, have become alarmed about this drift away from the &#39;Family Values&#39; issues that they believe should be the overwhelming concerns of Evangelicals. They have expressed their displeasure in letters of protest circulated through the religious media.</p><p>I only tour in short bursts, I&#39;m only ever away from my family and three daughters for a month or two.</p><p>Everybody sung in my family.</p><p>Well, I have a CBE and I accepted it with glee because it&#39;s not bestowed on you by the royal family, it&#39;s not bestowed on you by the government, you have to be nominated by the public.</p><p>I have often noticed that ancestors never boast of the descendants who boast of ancestors. I would rather start a family than finish one. Blood will tell, but often it tells too much.</p><p>They needed someone to write a script of The Great Gatsby very quickly for the movie they were making. I took this job so I&#39;d be sure to have some dough to support my family.</p><p>I had a number of very strong personalities in my family. My father was a concert flutist, the solo flute for Toscanini.</p><p>For my own family, I would always choose the makeshift, surrogate family formed by various characters unrelated by blood.</p><p>I think that&#39;s become passe, but if you can surround yourself with a kind of monument to yourself and your family - a statement - and you can afford it, then that&#39;s a noble project.</p><p>I&#39;m not ready to get married, but I have a pretty great family and I&#39;d like that too, someday.</p><p>I have a great family by the way, but you need to find people who can pull something out from you that might be otherwise unseen.</p><p>It&#39;s not an accident that both my sister and I are writers. Our parents created an accidental Petri dish. My family has great storytellers, and I grew up in a very funny, conversational house and didn&#39;t have television. This small family farm was a bubble world that didn&#39;t have much to do with reality.</p><p>A family is very special. So when a family splits up, it&#39;s not good, it&#39;s never good.</p><p>It never occurred to me that I wouldn&#39;t go to college and have a career - as well as a family - of my own. Both my parents, but especially my mother, encouraged me and led me to believe that it was possible.</p><p>After all is said that can be said upon the liquor traffic, its influence is degrading upon the individual, the family, politics and business, and upon everything that you touch in this old world.</p><p>I grew up in a family of strong women and I owe any capacity I have to understand women to my mother and big sister. They taught me to respect women in a way where I&#39;ve always felt a strong emotional connection to women, which has also helped me in the way I approach my work as an actor.</p><p>Life is not a matter of place, things or comfort rather, it concerns the basic human rights of family, country, justice and human dignity.</p><p>I don&#39;t think quantity time is as special as quality time with your family.</p><p>Interesting things come your way but as you get older, your lifestyle changes. I don&#39;t want to travel I don&#39;t want to be in a hotel room away from my family.</p><p>We all started snowboarding in the beginning as a family just to be closer together, go on trips. It was our soccer, but instead of Dad yelling at me from the sideline he is there riding with me and hitting the jumps even before I am hitting them.</p><p>In every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it, and given a family character, as it were, to the century.</p><p>Family involvement is a valuable thing and playing together actively can be the &#39;90s version of it. Instead of just watching, you can do it together... something we don&#39;t spend enough time on. We can motivate and excite each other about fitness.</p><p>My priorities are always going to be my husband and my family now. That&#39;s a huge, huge thing.</p><p>I think everybody has their own way of looking at their lives as some kind of pilgrimage. Some people will see their role as a pilgrim in terms of setting up a fine family, or establishing a business inheritance. Everyone&#39;s got their own definition.</p><p>Nobody in my family ever thought that I&#39;d a be a model.</p><p>I miss my family, and I like being a tourist when I go back.</p><p>We need to recognise that what really matters isn&#39;t buying more and more consumer goods, but family, friends, and knowing that we are doing something worthwhile with our lives. Helping to reduce the appalling consequences of world poverty should be part of that reassessment.</p><p>There&#39;s no road map on how to raise a family: it&#39;s always an enormous negotiation.</p><p>If you wish to spare yourself and your venerable family, give heed to my advice with the ear of intelligence. If you do not, you will see what God has willed.</p><p>Individual responsibility, hard work, paying attention in school, faith, family all these things are important.</p><p>I think it&#39;s been a little difficult at times for the audience, because they&#39;ve told me they see me as a family member. So to see your little sister sing about sex... I think they are pretty used to it now.</p><p>The secret is to make sure your family comes before anything else, because no matter what you do you&#39;ve got to come home.</p><p>I want a baby and I want a family, for sure.</p><p>Syria should not belong to one family, to one coterie, or to one party. It belongs to all the people of Syria equally, in all their religious and ethnic diversity.</p><p>My family is my life, and I&#39;ll never lose that.</p><p>I guess now that I think back, I used to play priest and be a funny priest. I don&#39;t know, I grew up in such a Catholic family that I kind of liked to test the boundaries a little bit and I think I had fun watching my mom laugh.</p><p>In the family sandwich, the older people and the younger ones can recognize one another as the bread. Those in the middle are, for a time, the meat.</p><p>I&#39;ve been screaming at the top of my lungs at my family, &#39;Work out! Work out! Old age is coming!&#39;</p><p>I&#39;m still very connected to my family, to the world I grew up in. I understand what it means to be afraid that you can&#39;t pay a doctor&#39;s bill. Or to have to make the choice between buying a band uniform for a seventh-grader and making the insurance payment on time. That will never leave me. It was how I lived until I was well into my adult years.</p><p>Like a lot of you, I grew up in a family on the ragged edges of the middle class. My daddy sold carpeting and ended up as a maintenance man. After he had a heart attack, my mom worked the phones at Sears so we could hang on to our house.</p><p>I do all of the grocery shopping in my little family. I buy cheese, of many different kinds, sliced packaged meats and poultry, bagels, immense quantities of eggs, pre-made fried chicken. Milk. Bacon. It is insane how much dairy, deli and bakery stuff I buy.</p><p>Personally, I think four is the perfect number of children for our particular family. Four is enough to create the frenzied cacophony that my husband and I find so joyful.</p><p>Liberals tend to put the onus of your success on society and conservatives on you and your family.</p><p>As a novelist, I mined my history, my family and my memory, but in a very specific way. Writing fiction, I never made use of experiences immediately as they happened. I needed to let things fester in my memory, mature and transmogrify into something meaningful.</p><p>Opponents of capital punishment argue that the state has no right to take a murderer&#39;s life. Apparently, one fact that abolitionists forget or overlook is that the state is acting not only on behalf of society, but also on behalf of the murdered person and the murdered person&#39;s family.</p><p>During the periods in my marriage when I chose to stay home with my kids rather than work as an attorney, it caused me no end of anxiety. Despite the fact that I knew I was contributing to our family by caring for our children, I still felt that my worth was less because I wasn&#39;t earning.</p><p>For all of higher civilization&#39;s recorded history, becoming a man was defined overwhelmingly as taking responsibility for a family.</p><p>Family farms and small businesses are the backbone of our communities.</p><p>My work&#39;s never been accepted by my family, but it&#39;s something I&#39;ll always carry on with.</p><p>I am a big fan of smelly cheeses but the rest of the family don&#39;t seem to be particularly keen on them.</p><p>I love being around my friends and my family and spending time with my husband. I like being normal and recharging my batteries, and I feel like I have the coolest job in the world where I get to get on stage and perform and get to do a lot of really amazing things.</p><p>When there is time to think about cricket, I think but when there is time to be with family, I try to do justice to that aspect of my life as well.</p><p>Many a man who pays rent all his life owns his own home and many a family has successfully saved for a home only to find itself at last with nothing but a house.</p><p>I&#39;ve been to all 50 states, and traveled this whole country, and 90 percent of the people are good folks. The rest of them take after the other side of the family.</p><p>My wife is so analytical with raising kids, and I am not. My feeling is if they turn out good, then that means I was a good daddy and put a lot of effort into it. If they turn out bad, it means they took after her side of the family.</p><p>My father never talked about the sacrifices that the family made for me.</p><p>It&#39;s not common for a woman on television, especially if she&#39;s the mom of the family, to be funny. She&#39;s usually a straight man or foil.</p><p>It&#39;s long been accepted as fact that the availability of family planning services saves lives. Where women have access to these services, children and families are healthier, and society at large benefits.</p><p>I can&#39;t move back to England. My home is in France now. I&#39;d love to but I can&#39;t. My family&#39;s all there now.</p><p>I always wanted my music to influence the life you were living emotionally - with your family, your lover, your wife, and, at a certain point, with your children.</p><p>Adoption has been a part of my life and a part of my family, so it was how I wanted to start. It felt natural and right to me.</p><p>I want my family to resemble the family I came from.</p><p>The town, the team, it&#39;s a family. That has helped. For some people who have had to deal with some of the problems I have had to deal with don&#39;t have football as an out.</p><p>We really were a very musical family. Father managed to buy us a small pump organ, and I just loved this instrument.</p><p>By 1969, when I celebrated 45 years in the music business, I also had 45 people in our musical family.</p><p>This character feels so much like my brother. He has two children. He has a wife. He works with me. He chooses to stay in New Hampshire because he wants his kids to grow up in the school they started with. He doesn&#39;t want them to lose friends. He is his family&#39;s hero.</p><p>The problem with me, as far as getting married and having a family, is that my comedy is so important to me. So I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever be as good a dad as my dad.</p><p>Sometimes you can&#39;t prioritise family and you feel guilty.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to do a family movie.</p><p>I have other obligations now - the show, my family, my life... though I know that without my sobriety I wouldn&#39;t have any of those things.</p><p>When I was working, and when I was making substantial amounts of money, I always filed and paid my taxes. This only stopped, when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family.</p><p>The pictures of my family were designed to be on a family wall, they were supposed to be together. It was supposed to copy my mother&#39;s wall in her house.</p><p>You never know when some small thing will lead to a big idea. Travel is very inspirational - but it&#39;s in the ordinary that I find my themes of love and work and family.</p><p>The monarchy is foremost a business, and it&#39;s important to them that the British public continue to finance the excessive luxurious lifestyles of the now quite enormous, wasteful and useless &#39;royal&#39; family. I find it very sad.</p><p>American Horror&#39; is the debasement of the suburban family, the way a lonely kid would have imagined it in the Seventies.;Rob Sheffield;family 20693;I&#39;m not an anarchist, but I believe that people don&#39;t want the royal family - the so-called royal family.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family 20694;My dad was a militant atheist, or is a militant atheist.

I&#39;ve always felt like this could be better.;Jonathan Safran Foer;family 20701;We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn&#39;t ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts.;Jonathan Safran Foer;family 20702;I&#39;m happiest with my family around me.;Amy Winehouse;family 20703;All the songs I write are about human dynamics, whether it&#39;s with girlfriends, boyfriends, or family.;Amy Winehouse;family 20704;We expect teachers to handle teenage pregnancy, substance abuse, and the failings of the family. Then we expect them to educate our children.;John Sculley;family 20705;I eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything. Everything in moderation. I know that&#39;s really hard for people to understand, but I grew up in an Italian family where we didn&#39;t overdo anything. We ate pasta, yes, but not a lot of it.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20706;When I go back to family reunions everybody goes, &#39;Hey cousin! Hey Auntie!&#39; And I&#39;m like, &#39;Okay I don&#39;t know you, I have no idea who you are.&#39; I am auntie and cousin for so many and even the ones in prison call me collect. And I&#39;ll be like, &#39;Which of my family members are giving you this phone number?</p><p>I&#39;m the git in the family.</p><p>A loving family provides the foundation children need to succeed, and strong families with a man and a woman - bonded together for life - always have been, and always will be, the key to such families.</p><p>People can undergo a sudden change of thinking and loyalties under threat of death or intense social pressure and isolation from friends and family.</p><p>I would look at a dog and when our eyes met, I realized that the dog and all creatures are my family.

I&#39;m not asking that they believe like I do that it&#39;s inborn. I&#39;m not asking that. All I&#39;m saying is don&#39;t let these children suffer without a family because of your bias.</p><p>The left sees nothing but bigotry and superstition in the popular defense of the family or in popular attitudes regarding abortion, crime, busing, and the school curriculum.</p><p>If you go from a structure where you have the support and that partner and that construction of a family and that&#39;s broken apart, I think that&#39;s probably a lot harder than always being a single mom and having the father being a support in another area.</p><p>When liberals finally grasped the strength of popular feeling about the family, they cried to appropriate the rhetoric and symbolism of family values for their own purposes.</p><p>How do you rebel in a family of rebels?</p><p>My dad&#39;s whole family is in Madras and I was born in America so we didn&#39;t have that big Indian community. I don&#39;t really have anything interesting to say about it. When I talk about it people are like, &#39;meh, let&#39;s talk about something else.&#39;</p><p>I am like a kid. I tell my family and friends I&#39;m like a kid.</p><p>You might think that after thousands of years of coming up too soon and getting frozen, the crocus family would have had a little sense knocked into it.</p><p>From very early on in my childhood - four, five years old - I felt alien to the human race. I felt very comfortable with thinking I was from another planet, because I felt disconnected - I was very tall and skinny, and I didn&#39;t look like anybody else, I didn&#39;t even look like any member of my family.</p><p>A rumor that followed me forever was that my family was in the mafia. For years I had to live with it. They&#39;d call me the mafia princess, so I rolled with it for the rest of high school. People even joke about it today.</p><p>Instead of plotting the demise of the traditional family, as some politicians and religious leaders would have you believe, gay people mow their lawns and watch &#39;American Idol&#39; and video their children&#39;s concerts and have the same hopes and dreams that their straight counterparts do.</p><p>My whole family is very sarcastic and constantly making jokes.</p><p>My encounters with racism are sort of second-hand situations where I might be standing around with a group of white friends and someone makes a comment that they wouldn&#39;t make at my family reunion.</p><p>Here&#39;s the thing: the unit of reverence in Europe is the family, which is why a child born today of unmarried parents in Sweden has a better chance of growing up in a house with both of his parents than a child born to a married couple in America. Here we revere the couple, there they revere the family.</p><p>Sometimes you struggle so hard to feed your family one way, you forget to feed them the other way, with spiritual nourishment. Everybody needs that.</p><p>Thank you to everyone that has made me the athlete I am! God, family and friends, my competitors and supporters!

It is this diversity that makes a country, indeed a state, a city, a church, or a family, healthy. &#39;One-size-fits-all,&#39; and that size determined by the State has a name, and that name is &#39;slavery.&#39;</p><p>Our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit... Santa, who was jolly - but, let&#39;s face it, he was also very judgmental.</p><p>The family is the school of duties - founded on love.</p><p>My family were from Jamaica.</p><p>I believe in God, family, truth between people, the power of love.</p><p>My family... always had the value of the family table and these cultural influences of growing up.</p><p>We&#39;ll be going to the fish market and a farmer&#39;s market this afternoon to get what we need to make and eat dinner as a family.

I fortunately had really heavy anchors - old friends, family.</p><p>My mother was passionate. She was stubborn, the dominant one in the family. She dominated my father.</p><p>My mother was the first woman in the county in Indiana where we were born, in Jay County, to have a college degree. She was educated as a pianist and she wanted to concertize, but when the war came she was married, had a family, so she started teaching.</p><p>At this time when I turn 50, because so there&#39;s many of my friends and family who didn&#39;t get to see 50-years-old, and so, I&#39;m celebrating for them too.</p><p>There is only one way to solve the alleged crisis of the erosion of &#39;family values.&#39; And that is to get right down to the root cause of the problem.</p><p>My family, you know, are all still, you know, very close.

My whole family is crazy.</p><p>My goals have changed throughout my life. At one time it was winning awards, selling out concert dates, selling more albums than anyone else. Now, my goals are to see my grandchildren grown, live a long and healthy life with my family and friends and travel the world.</p><p>If you want to look at the state of humans, you should look at the state of animals first. People are choosing whether or not they can feed an animal and their family. And every shelter coast-to-coast is stuffed.</p><p>Diabetes affects my family. One of my kids is affected by it.</p><p>I really appreciate family. I really can&#39;t imagine life without them!</p><p>It&#39;s a tremendous responsibility to be direct descendants of the prophet Muhammad. This family has had the burden of leadership on its shoulders for 1,400 years. I&#39;m not going to drop the ball on my shift.</p><p>At one point in my life, I was very involved with social causes. I&#39;m still involved, but now I have a family and it&#39;s important to me.</p><p>I have one friend that I&#39;ve had since I was born, and she&#39;s from Coatzacoalcos. She&#39;s not really impressed or interested in the actor&#39;s life. My family isn&#39;t really either.</p><p>From those to whom much is given, much is expected. I have been given much - the love of my family, the faith and trust of the people of New York, and the chance to lead this state. I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me.</p><p>I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my, or any, sense of right and wrong. I apologize first and most importantly to my family. I apologize to the public, whom I promised better.</p><p>Well, one of the most important things for Americans to be reminded of is that a lot of the exceptional nature of our country is founded in Judeo-Christian values that promotes individualism, personal responsibility, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to family, charity.</p><p>I&#39;m an actor I&#39;m not a politician. I always kick myself when I talk too much about family, or personal things.</p><p>Look, I&#39;ve got incredible pride for my family. I&#39;ve absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly.</p><p>There was a great complexity to my father. He was a devoted family man. But, in the same breath, he simply was not suited to an anchored life. He should have been somebody who had a backpack, an old map, a bit of change in his pocket and that was it - roaming the world.</p><p>I can make dressing - or stuffing. Y&#39;all call it stuffing up here, we call it dressing down there. It&#39;s really good dressing. That family recipe was passed on, and I love to make that.</p><p>If you feel rooted in your home and family, if you&#39;re active in your community, there&#39;s nothing more empowering. The best way to make a difference in the world is to start by making a difference in your own life.</p><p>I text a lot people, because it&#39;s how I stay connected with all my family and friends when I&#39;m on set and traveling.</p><p>My family belongs to a tennis club in Valencia, California, so I always go there. I play a lot of tennis with my dad and swim. And I like to go to the gym there.</p><p>Experience taught me that working families are often just one pay check away from economic disaster. And it showed me first-hand the importance of every family having access to good health care.</p><p>It&#39;s very hard to make arguments about the effects of cloning on family relations if family relations are in tatters.</p><p>My family is from the South, and I can remember all those ladies I grew up with, like my great-aunts, who had handkerchiefs. There&#39;s something sweet about them.</p><p>My kids are the future of the Mayweather family and of the Mayweather brand. I feel our family is stronger if we stay together.</p><p>I have a really, really, really normal family. And by normal I mean we&#39;re all nuts on some level. I think you&#39;ve gotta be a little nuts to pursue any kind of creative job. I was also a really good kid. I know that sounds really dull, but I didn&#39;t rebel in the traditional sense.</p><p>Selfishness, narcissism, being uncomfortable in your own skin, not feeling connected to the world around you, feeling dislocated from family and youth, having a strange relationship with your childhood - all those things feel really true to me.</p><p>I have a family.</p><p>The kitchen really is the castle itself. This is where we spend our happiest moments and where we find the joy of being a family.</p><p>My humanitarian work evolved from being with my family. My mom, my dad, they really set a great example for giving back. My mom was a nurse, my dad was a school teacher. But my mom did a lot of things for geriatrics and elderly people. She would do home visits for free.</p><p>Given my last position, that I was the first U.S attorney post 9/11 in New Jersey, I understand acutely the pain and sorrow and upset of the family members who lost loved ones that day at the hands of radical Muslim extremists. And their sensitivities and concerns have to be taken into account.</p><p>It sounds cliche, but success is your friends, your family, what you do, and if you&#39;re happy when you wake up.</p><p>I think the Hispanic community, the values that resonate in our community, are fundamentally conservative. They are faith, family, patriotism.</p><p>I contribute my best in my sport and I also have a ton of respect for myself and my family.</p><p>One&#39;s nativity is not of his own choosing, but whatever it may be, it is entitled to respect and all nations have honorable place in the world&#39;s family.</p><p>Fame is a lot of pressure, especially when you&#39;re responsible for your entire family. Financially, emotionally - everything.</p><p>I was the first person to go to university from my family.</p><p>You should be able to afford health care for your family.

There is a tradition of that in my family.;Bjork;family 20807;The Royal family to me are not England, and they are not the flag.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family 20808;My family, although they&#39;re very large on both my parents&#39; sides, they don&#39;t know much about their family tree. Occasionally, they try to dig, but they can&#39;t get very far, and it&#39;s baffling. In Dublin, it seems that so many public records were wiped out it&#39;s proven to be very difficult, so I know very little.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family 20809;Anyone that has a job that takes them away from home, I think, can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency, not only with your family and those you love but with your friends.;Heath Ledger;family 20810;I&#39;m not sure why no one wants to admit there&#39;s a viable audience out there that believes in God and wants to see a movie with their family. The demand is there. The supply is not.;Tyler Perry;family 20811;Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20812;Jews have deep respect for the Queen and the royal family. We say a prayer for them every Sabbath in synagogue. We recite a special blessing on seeing the Queen.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20813;Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy. To try to do it by placing the entire burden on women - 91% of single-parent families in Britain are headed by the mother, according to census data - is practically absurd and morally indefensible.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20814;We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. No one does interfaith better than the Royal family, and it starts with the Queen herself.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20815;I grew up in a family where the internalized understanding was that the kids were going to grow up into a better world. I worry, because I don&#39;t think my kids are going to have that. The world is very scary. The world would be scary without the choices the current administration made, but they just exacerbated it. And it ticks me off. I want my kids to have a good life.;Bradley Whitford;family 20816;No journalist has ever been in my house and no photographs have ever been taken of where I live.

We may be dysfunctional but we&#39;re still family.;Star Jones;family 20819;I like all the families in the U.K. But what I like about the idea of the royal family is... they seem like they&#39;re well educated and there&#39;s something admirable about them.

We started in Colorado, where I lived for five years. We moved to Chicago for two years, to San Francisco for one year, Connecticut for seven, Oregon for a couple years, and then I went to school.;Gus Van Sant;family 20830;Because I didn&#39;t have brothers, I was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family, so I became one of them - but it was not my family.;Gus Van Sant;family 20831;According to the Small Business Administration, more than 70 percent of all family businesses do not survive through the second generation, and 8 percent do not make it to a third.;Kit Bond;family 20832;I wasn&#39;t looking to get into TV. My family was in the movie business, so I was never interested in that world.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20833;The summer before I went to culinary school, my family wanted me to take a job on a movie to make sure that I was making the right decision. I think they hoped I would change my mind about culinary school.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20834;My family truly believes they are better cooks than I am. They see me as Giada, not as a celebrity chef. To them I&#39;m just me - their granddaughter, niece, etc., and they&#39;re older and wiser. I like that because it keeps you grounded.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20835;I want to deal with somebody who comes from another country to the United States and has a family that comes. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a black family from Jamaica or a Hispanic family from Mexico. These issues need to be dealt with, but they need to be dealt with in the entertaining way.;Harvey Weinstein;family 20836;A plague on eminence!

But all of them have great senses of humor.</p><p>I remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the Navy. He didn&#39;t have to. He was older than other servicemen and had a family to support but he wanted to be a part of the fight against fascism, not just make movies about it.

I love being with my family and I love snow. I love the music and the lights and all of it.</p><p>On the one hand, the idea of marriage and the sort of traditional family life repulses me. But on the other hand, I long for it, you know what I mean? I&#39;m constantly in conflict with things. And it is because of my past and my upbringing and the journey that I&#39;ve been on.</p><p>I like being in kids&#39; movies, and I like being in family movies.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe in being mean to anyone.

You&#39;re almost in a haze because you don&#39;t really know where you are half the time: You&#39;re in a hotel room one moment, and the next thing you know, you&#39;re onstage performing for 60,000 people, then you&#39;re back on an airplane.

And if you&#39;re a parent, so do you.</p><p>Spending $1 for a brand new house would feel very, very good. Spending $1,000 for a ham sandwich would feel very, very bad. Spending $19,000 for a small family car would feel, well, more or less right. But as with physical pain, fiscal pain can depend on the individual, and everyone has a different threshold.</p><p>It&#39;s one of the worst-kept secrets of family life that all parents have a preferred son or daughter, and the rules for acknowledging it are the same everywhere: The favored kids recognize their status and keep quiet about it - the better to preserve the good thing they&#39;ve got going and to keep their siblings off their back.</p><p>There&#39;s a sort of sibling moratorium when you&#39;re establishing yourself as an adult. So much of your energy has to be focused on other things like work and kids. But when people become more settled, siblings tend to regroup because now you&#39;re building a new extended family.</p><p>Humans have a fraught relationship with beasts. They are our companions and our chattel, our family members and our laborers, our household pets and our household pests. We love them and cage them, admire them and abuse them.

My mother never laughed at my dream of Africa, even though everyone else did because we didn&#39;t have any money, because Africa was the &#39;dark continent&#39;, and because I was a girl.</p><p>When I look back over my life it&#39;s almost as if there was a plan laid out for me - from the little girl who was so passionate about animals who longed to go to Africa and whose family couldn&#39;t afford to put her through college. Everyone laughed at my dreams. I was supposed to be a secretary in Bournemouth.</p><p>You can be cool and at the same time respect your woman, who will hopefully become your wife, who will hopefully become the mother of your kids. America needs to get back to family values.</p><p>I&#39;m very excited about my new agreement with the Heat. This contract allows me to address all of my family&#39;s long-term financial goals while allowing the Heat the ability to acquire those players that we need to win a championship.</p><p>For me, it&#39;s about the way I carry myself and the way I treat other people. My relationship and how I feel about God and what He does for me, is something deeply personal. It&#39;s where I came from, my family, I was brought up in a religious household and that&#39;s very important to me.</p><p>While I have felt lonely many times in my life, the oddest feeling of all was after my mother, Lucille, died. My father had already died, but I always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive. It seems strange to say now that I felt so lonely, yet I did.</p><p>I was always on the go, and thought I was too busy to develop something like this. I thought at the time that diabetes went along with bad habits, but I was the last one in my family to eat junk food.</p><p>In my family in particular, I think, there was a sense we have to work twice as hard.</p><p>My mother isolated herself from all family and friends for some 20 years. And never met her grandchild, my son.</p><p>I grew up in a Ukrainian Catholic-turned-Christian household, and that is my family&#39;s faith.</p><p>We are a very crafty family.</p><p>I come from a massive family, and the youngest is twentysomething years younger than I am, so I grew up with children.</p><p>I have a very strong family.</p><p>I just want to have a great relationship with my child and have a great family dynamic.</p><p>As a child, I had to get up early for school or work. I&#39;d get ready by myself. I&#39;d set my alarm to wake me up very early in the morning, and be off to work, the family driver driving me every morning. I did it alone, my parents never coming in to wake me up.</p><p>I need to work to support my family.</p><p>My dream, maybe because of my family, of course, was to be a painter. I chose in one moment the direction of textiles from textiles I went to fashion.</p><p>But for me, I thought you made a record, you got on a bus, went out and played your shows and made a lot of money. That was the way it was supposed to go down. But there&#39;s a lot more to it than that. There are a lot of early mornings, late nights, a lot of traveling, a lot of being away from home, being away from your family.</p><p>Short of baseball and my family, it was gaming. And gaming is a $20-million to $200-million multi-year effort. It&#39;s an insane, stupid and utterly irresponsible act. But I did it.</p><p>I began to speak well at a very advanced age - 15, 16, 17 years old. It was psychological: the trauma of war, my family and growing up on my own. I was more or less a street kid.</p><p>I am a universalist, passionately devoted to the cause of equality within the human family.</p><p>I love seeing my family.</p><p>You don&#39;t have a family doctor anymore like you did when you were a kid, who treated you throughout your life.</p><p>My father really was not the dominant person who raised the family, it was my mother who raised the family.</p><p>I love film. After a yummy meal for the whole family and some truly great friends, we often go out to see something beautiful and unique.</p><p>As children we recognized that we belonged to an unusual, even exceptional, family, but the effect was different on each of us.</p><p>The American people know what&#39;s necessary to get this economy moving again. It&#39;s fiscal discipline in Washington, D.C. and across-the-board tax relief for working families, small businesses and family farms.</p><p>The Royal Family are not like you and me. They live in houses so big that you can walk round all day and never need to meet your spouse. The Queen and Prince Philip have never shared a bedroom in their lives. They don&#39;t even have breakfast together.</p><p>With the counseling of my family doctor, my mother ended up turning to Weight Watchers and their children&#39;s program. I went to weekly meetings, got counseling and would exercise with my peers who were my size. It was the first time I saw a proper children&#39;s portion size, and it wasn&#39;t two burgers, it was one.</p><p>I was the youngest of my entire family so you are tap-dancing to try to get the attention of your older cousins. I really hit my social stride in 6th grade, but before that I was a pretty big dork. You learn how to be amusing and how to work for it.</p><p>To me, the kitchen is a place of adventure and entirely fun, not drudgery. I can&#39;t think of anything better to do with family and friends than to be together to create something.</p><p>I always loved family holidays, and I had this vision and dream as a little girl of having a big family of my own.</p><p>I think with motherhood and child-rearing in general, everyone&#39;s going to tell you how to do it and why. I&#39;ve always said to other mothers and women when they&#39;ve asked me, that you have to find your own way and find out what works for your family, at all costs.</p><p>Although my family - parents and sister - all work in the personnel management business, their real passion is performing, amateur operatic societies and so on.</p><p>Film is an illusion. Fame is ephemeral. Faith and family are what endure.</p><p>I think &#39;Tattoo&#39;&#39;s a song that can go so many different ways. Some people think of it as a break-up song, but, for me, it&#39;s about somebody who comes into your life and really touches you - be they a friend, a family member or someone you&#39;re in a relationship with.</p><p>It&#39;s cool to have parents and family who will always tell me the truth no matter what. They&#39;ll tell me if I&#39;m doing something stupid!</p><p>My family was all born in Sicily and I&#39;m Italian-American. They&#39;re the real thing. They&#39;re authentic Italians, and honestly they&#39;re the most open-minded, nicest people in the world and nothing can really offend them. That&#39;s the way I think true Sicilians are.</p><p>I think when someone is injured in your family, you want to speak to the individual and you want to hear their voice and you want to make sure they are OK.</p><p>Growing up with my family gave me some of my best memories. I&#39;d like to have a family of my own - slip away for a bit and do nothing but spend those early years with my children.</p><p>I&#39;m over the moon to be involved in the &#39;Doctor Who&#39; Christmas special. I can&#39;t quite believe it as it&#39;s a part of the family tradition at the Jenkins household. I heard the news that I got the role on my 30th birthday and it was the best birthday present ever.</p><p>You have no idea how humiliating it was, as a boy, to suddenly have all your clothes, your toys, snatched by the bailiff. I mean we were a middle-class family, it&#39;s not as if it was happening up and down the street. It made me ashamed, I felt dirty.</p><p>I was quite able at the insignificant work I did in MI6, but absolutely dysfunctional in my domestic life. I had no experience of fatherhood. I had no example of marital bliss or the family unit.</p><p>I like playing music because it&#39;s a good living and I get satisfaction from it. But I can&#39;t feed my family with satisfaction.</p><p>Baseball life is a tough life on the family.</p><p>I work six months and get three or four with the family.</p><p>I work six months and get three or four with the family. I&#39;ve stopped racing to get to the red light.</p><p>I&#39;m very, very concerned about the Bush presidency. I&#39;m worried about the kinds of cuts in domestic programs that mean something to a lot of people, including members of my family, who depend on certain things from the government.</p><p>I have a lot of responsibilities outside myself. I have a large family. I want to know I can always be helpful.</p><p>My family makes these vinegars - out of everything from grapes to peaches and cherries. We go through the whole process with the giant vat and drainer, label them, and give them as Christmas presents.</p><p>We don&#39;t have the luxury of time. We spend more because of how we live, but it&#39;s important to be with our family and friends.</p><p>I tend to show everything I do to my family, to check they won&#39;t be offended.</p><p>When I was growing up in Mississippi - it was good Southern food... but I also grew up with a Greek family when other kids were eating fried okra, we were eating steamed artichokes. So I think it played a big part in my healthy cooking.</p><p>I&#39;m just a public-schoolboy. I&#39;ve got a degree. I&#39;m from a middle-class family in Devon. I&#39;ve got no story.</p><p>In my family, we let our boys have a say in what veggie side they want for dinner that night. We list off a handful of options and get them excited about helping to plan the dinner menu. They&#39;re much more inclined to finish their plates when they&#39;ve helped decide what goes on them.</p><p>To me, money is the ability to create lifelong experiences for my family and myself, to educate my children and a way to give back to humanity.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been part of comedy. One of the things about our family was that if we were reasonably funny with each other, particularly my two brothers and myself, when my father was upset with something you&#39;d want to make sure in some way you made him laugh. Because when he didn&#39;t laugh, you were in trouble!</p><p>I&#39;ve been experimenting more and more with LN2, liquid nitrogen. I&#39;ve used it in battle on &#39;Iron Chef America,&#39; but have also made some great ice creams at home for my family. Since it freezes basically on contact, you can have ice cream ready in mere minutes.</p><p>My family brought me up to be very respectful of people.</p><p>When I&#39;m home, the heart and soul of our family is in the kitchen. Growing up, my parents both worked, so dinnertime was for family - the TV was off. I think it&#39;s important to grab that time and really make it special, even after a tough day.</p><p>My parents did a great job raising me and my two sisters. We all graduated from high school and we all graduated from college. So, to be a good representative of my family is probably my greatest accomplishment thus far.</p><p>I would like a food/lifestyle show. We&#39;re not sure what that is yet. I want to be able to share what I do and how I raise my family. I feel like I have a story to tell. I enjoy talking and listening, sharing ideas and sharing advice.</p><p>And whereas women had to fight to find their way into the workforce, men are now fighting to reclaim their place in the family structure.</p><p>I&#39;ve always known I wanted a family.</p><p>But I am Armenian and I understand what it is to lose a country and lose a family and have massacres and genocides and everything against my people.</p><p>More than any other setting - more than battlefields or boardrooms or a spaceship headed for intergalactic travel - I&#39;ll put my money on the family to provide an endless source of comedy, tragedy and intrigue.</p><p>The importance of human life should be universally respected - and that refers to children before they are born and after. All children have the right to be brought up in a loving two-parent family where the notion of divorce is not even possible.</p><p>While Free Choice Vouchers didn&#39;t fulfill my vision of a health care system in which every American would be empowered to hire and fire their insurance company, they were a foothold for choice and competition and a safety valve for Americans whose employers are already forcing them to bear more and more of their family&#39;s health insurance costs.</p><p>Everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.</p><p>I have no use for people who throw their weight around as celebrities, or for those who fawn over you just because you are famous.</p><p>What a heavy burden is a name that has become too famous.</p><p>We all want to be famous people, and the moment we want to be something we are no longer free.</p><p>Famous, adj.: Conspicuously miserable.</p><p>Martyrdom is the only way a man can become famous without ability.</p><p>Andy Warhol made fame more famous.</p><p>I just want to make music, I don&#39;t want people to talk about me. All I&#39;ve ever wanted to do was sing. I don&#39;t want to be a celebrity. I don&#39;t want to be in people&#39;s faces, you know, constantly on covers of magazine that I haven&#39;t even known I&#39;m on.</p><p>It&#39;s really easy to avoid the tabloids. You just live your life and don&#39;t hang out with famous people who are in the tabloids. Don&#39;t do anything controversial and be a normal person. Have friends. And get a job and keep working.</p><p>I wanted to be successful, not famous.</p><p>I&#39;m not comfortable being around too many people. I don&#39;t like being out in public too much. I don&#39;t like going to bars. I don&#39;t like doing celebrity stuff. So most of the characters I play are people who don&#39;t always feel comfortable beyond their small circle of friends.</p><p>How many famous and high-spirited heroes have lived a day too long?</p><p>I like being famous when it&#39;s convenient for me and completely anonymous when it&#39;s not.</p><p>I never wanted to be famous. I only wanted to be great.</p><p>For famous men have the whole earth as their memorial.</p><p>I know I&#39;m not supposed to have any opinions about politics, because I&#39;m famous.</p><p>I&#39;d rather be able to face myself in the bathroom mirror than be rich and famous.</p><p>You&#39;re not famous until my mother has heard of you.</p><p>It isn&#39;t necessary to be rich and famous to be happy. It&#39;s only necessary to be rich.</p><p>I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: &#39;try being rich first&#39;. See if that doesn&#39;t cover most of it. There&#39;s not much downside to being rich, other than paying taxes and having your relatives ask you for money. But when you become famous, you end up with a 24-hour job.</p><p>There&#39;s no difference between fame and infamy now. There&#39;s a new school of professional famous people that don&#39;t do anything. They don&#39;t create anything.</p><p>Nothing in life prepares you to be famous.</p><p>I can do whatever I want - I&#39;m rich, I&#39;m famous, and I&#39;m bigger than you.</p><p>It is a mark of many famous people that they cannot part with their brightest hour.</p><p>Tom Cruise, he&#39;s a lot more famous than me.</p><p>People hate me because I am a multifaceted, talented, wealthy, internationally famous genius.</p><p>I am beautiful, famous and gorgeous.</p><p>A famous person to themselves, they don&#39;t get up in the morning and think, I&#39;m famous. I&#39;m not famous to me. Famous is a perception.</p><p>The hardest thing about being famous is that people are always nice to you. You&#39;re in a conversation and everybody&#39;s agreeing with what you&#39;re saying - even if you say something totally crazy. You need people who can tell you what you don&#39;t want to hear.</p><p>For a time, at least, I was the most famous person in the entire world.</p><p>Fate is being kind to me. Fate doesn&#39;t want me to be too famous too young.</p><p>Being big and famous doesn&#39;t get you more freedom, it gets you less.</p><p>Celebrity distorts democracy by giving the rich, beautiful, and famous more authority than they deserve.</p><p>I wrote because I needed to and wanted to. It never occurred to me that I&#39;d become famous.</p><p>Indeed, wretched the man whose fame makes his misfortunes famous.</p><p>I put my money in the bank: I have to think of life after modeling, when I&#39;m not famous any more.</p><p>My story of success and failure is not just about music and being famous. It&#39;s about living and loving and trying to find purpose in this crazy world.</p><p>Celebrity gives us delusion of self importance.</p><p>I&#39;ve worked with a lot of people who are more famous than myself who are terribly insecure.</p><p>But I know newspapers. They have the first amendment and they can tell any lie knowing it&#39;s a lie and they&#39;re protected if the person&#39;s famous or it&#39;s a company.</p><p>Celebrity, to me, is not a thing to seek.</p><p>The thing about being famous is, it&#39;s weird. The only people who get how weird it is are other famous people.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to have an attitude if you&#39;re famous.</p><p>I seek no longer to be a &#39;famous&#39; person, and instead I wish to live a &#39;normal&#39; life.</p><p>Public misbehavior by the famous is a powerful teaching tool.</p><p>When you become famous, being famous becomes your profession.</p><p>Acting is not about being famous, it&#39;s about exploring the human soul.</p><p>I want to be famous everywhere.</p><p>I really hate the duties of being a celebrity, like getting dressed up for the red carpet.</p><p>If there&#39;s anything more mortifying than being famous at 14, it&#39;s being washed up right after.</p><p>My favorite thing about being famous... it&#39;s not really as big of a deal as everybody says it is. Being on the road is tough, doing interviews, and all the stuff. It&#39;s still pretty tough.</p><p>I can&#39;t see any value in being a celebrity, famous for being famous.</p><p>The whole celebrity culture thing - I&#39;m fascinated by, and repelled by, and yet I end up knowing about it.</p><p>When I&#39;m living in the world of luxury and celebrity, which is where I found myself for a large part of my life, it&#39;s a walk-on part. Not a vital necessity, like it is for so many people. I enjoy it but I can see right through it!</p><p>I will either be famous or infamous.</p><p>Sometimes being famous gets in the way of doing what you want to do.</p><p>I think that when you are famous every weakness is exaggerated.</p><p>Before I was famous, when I was just working in Gilbert&#39;s Lodge, everything was moving in slow motion.</p><p>Martyrdom: The only way a man can become famous without ability.</p><p>To be famous, in fact, one has only to kill one&#39;s landlady.</p><p>Wood burns because it has the proper stuff in it and a man becomes famous because he has the proper stuff in him.</p><p>When I started out, I didn&#39;t have any desire to be an actress or to learn how to act. I just wanted to be famous.</p><p>Did you ever stop to think why cops are always famous for being dumb? Simple. Because they don&#39;t have to be anything else.</p><p>A very quiet and tasteful way to be famous is to have a famous relative. Then you can not only be nothing, you can do nothing too.</p><p>I&#39;m bored with that line. I never use it anymore. My new line is &#39;In 15 minutes everybody will be famous.&#39;</p><p>I don&#39;t like Los Angeles. The people are awful and terribly shallow, and everybody wants to be famous but nobody wants to play the game. I&#39;m from New York. I will kill to get what I need.</p><p>The cool thing about being famous is traveling. I have always wanted to travel across seas, like to Canada and stuff.</p><p>My idea of a good picture is one that&#39;s in focus and of a famous person.</p><p>In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.</p><p>After a fellow gets famous it doesn&#39;t take long for someone to bob up that used to sit by him in school.</p><p>And to me, fame is not a positive thing. The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality. It&#39;s fantastic when you go to premieres and people cheer you, but it&#39;s not real. And it&#39;s totally not my approach to get my name on a club door just because I can.</p><p>I served the famous professors and scholars, and eventually they learned that the Reverend Moon is superior to them. Even Nobel laureate academics who thought they were at the center of knowledge are as nothing in front of me.</p><p>A chair is a very difficult object. A skyscraper is almost easier. That is why Chippendale is famous.</p><p>If you want to be a rock star or just be famous, then run down the street naked, you&#39;ll make the news or something. But if you want music to be your livelihood, then play, play, play and play! And eventually you&#39;ll get to where you want to be.</p><p>When we were growing up our parents somehow made it clear that being famous was good. And I mistakenly thought that if I was famous then everyone would love me.</p><p>I was never very interested in boys - and there were plenty of them - vying with one another to see how many famous women they would get into the hay.</p><p>Some of the most famous books are the least worth reading. Their fame was due to their having done something that needed to be doing in their day. The work is done and the virtue of the book has expired.</p><p>There&#39;s more pressure to be famous for being yourself than if you&#39;re being a character.</p><p>Any idiot can get laid when they&#39;re famous. That&#39;s easy. It&#39;s getting laid when you&#39;re not famous that takes some talent.</p><p>Mum loves me being famous! She is so excited and proud, as she had me so young and couldn&#39;t support me, so I am living her dream, it&#39;s sweeter for both of us. It&#39;s her 40th birthday soon and I&#39;m going to buy her 40 presents.</p><p>The fame thing is interesting because I never wanted to be famous, and I never dreamt I would be famous.</p><p>I imagined being a famous writer would be like being like Jane Austen.</p><p>There is a misleading, unwritten rule that states if a quote giving advice comes from someone famous, very old, or Greek, then it must be good advice.</p><p>If you think Abraham Lincoln became famous for inventing the town car, it is time to spend a few hours on history.</p><p>Forget about being world famous, it&#39;s hard enough just getting the automatic doors at the supermarket to acknowledge our existence.</p><p>Yeah, I love being famous. It&#39;s almost like being white, y&#39;know?</p><p>What I&#39;ve learned is that you really don&#39;t need to be a celebrity or have money or have the paparazzi following you around to be famous.</p><p>I&#39;ve never sat there and plotted out how I was going to become successful or famous.</p><p>I think the driving thing was curiosity about the universe. That fascinated me. I didn&#39;t think anything about being famous or anything like that, I was just interested in the concepts involved.</p><p>We are not interested in cloning the Michael Jordans and the Michael Jacksons of this world. The rich and the famous don&#39;t participate in this.</p><p>I have a profound empathy for people who are in the public eye, whether they manifest it themselves or whether it happened by accident - it doesn&#39;t matter to me. I think there&#39;s a great misunderstanding of what it is to be famous.</p><p>I thought the more famous I became, the more friendships I would have, but the opposite was true.</p><p>I&#39;m more interested in being good than being famous.</p><p>Aristotle was famous for knowing everything. He taught that the brain exists merely to cool the blood and is not involved in the process of thinking. This is true only of certain persons.</p><p>I love being famous. It&#39;s almost like being white.</p><p>Dates with actors, finally, just seemed to me evenings of shop talk. I got sick of it after a hile. So the more famous I became, the more I narrowed down my choices.</p><p>Sometimes people offer you plays, they offer you parts, but they only offer it because I&#39;m famous.</p><p>I became very famous, as a teenager, and my name and photo were splashed in all the media. They made me larger than life, so I wanted to live larger than life, and the only way to do that was to be intoxicated.</p><p>For me, growing up, the downside of it was that as a kid you don&#39;t want to stand out. You don&#39;t want to have a famous father let alone get a job because of your famous father, you know? But I&#39;m a product of nepotism. That&#39;s how I got my foot in the door, through my dad.</p><p>Whenever you&#39;re the child of a famous person, you get judged in odd ways because of that.</p><p>The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality.</p><p>I have been very happy, very rich, very beautiful, much adulated, very famous and very unhappy.</p><p>It&#39;s interesting because people assume that because I&#39;m famous I know all famous people.</p><p>I&#39;m doing a new musical on Broadway, which opens in October called &#39;The Boy from Oz,&#39; where I play Peter Allen. For those of you who don&#39;t know, he became first famous in America for marrying Liza Minelli.</p><p>There were a few years there when I was just so enamored with the idea of living some sort of famous person&#39;s lifestyle that really isn&#39;t suited to me.</p><p>I think it&#39;s useful, as a famous person, to have as little separation between the perception of you and how you really are - because otherwise I&#39;d be sitting here thinking I&#39;m keeping secrets, and wondering when you&#39;re going to find out.</p><p>In the sixties, everyone you knew became famous. My flatmate was Terence Stamp. My barber was Vidal Sassoon. David Hockney did the menu in a restaurant I went to. I didn&#39;t know anyone unknown who didn&#39;t become famous.</p><p>I made my living being 20 or 30 pounds heavier than the average model. And that&#39;s where I got famous.</p><p>When I was going for my graduate degree, I decided I was going to make a feature film as my thesis. That&#39;s what I was famous for-that I had my thesis film be a feature film, which was &#39;You&#39;re a Big Boy Now.&#39;</p><p>Since I was seventeen I thought I might be a star. I&#39;d think about all my heroes, Charlie Parker, Jimi Hendrix... I had a romantic feeling about how these people became famous.</p><p>Other famous men, those of much talk and few deeds, soon evaporate. Action is the dignity of greatness.</p><p>Lance Armstrong, the famous cyclist and more importantly, cancer survivor, has said &#39;if you ever get a second chance for something, you&#39;ve got to go all the way.&#39;</p><p>The strangest part about being famous is you don&#39;t get to give first impressions anymore. Everyone already has an impression of you before you meet them.</p><p>I have no interest in Shakespeare and all that British nonsense... I just wanted to get famous and all the rest is hogwash.</p><p>I certainly don&#39;t think you need to be famous to want to leave a legacy, but when you are famous, it&#39;s even more likely that your child will get the wrong perspective on your life if you die prematurely.</p><p>One thing about being famous is the people around you, you pay all their bills so they very rarely disagree with you because they want you to pick up the check.</p><p>People just assume that if you&#39;re famous, you&#39;re in Hollywood.</p><p>If you look closely, there is no book more visual than Three Trapped Tigers, in that it is filled with blank pages, dark pages, it has stars made of words, the famous magical cube made of numbers, and there is even a page which is a mirror.</p><p>Among famous traitors of history one might mention the weather.</p><p>Know the names of past and current artists who are most famous for playing their instruments.</p><p>I think there are a lot of people who really want to be famous, they really do. I don&#39;t. It sort of gets in the way of the everyday things that I do.</p><p>Comedy has to be done en clair. You can&#39;t blunt the edge of wit or the point of satire with obscurity. Try to imagine a famous witty saying that is not immediately clear.</p><p>Bruce Lee was very famous. I watched his movies and he is amazing. He is a martial arts master, his philosophy, his movement, both physically and mentally, were very strong.</p><p>You can get rich or famous by doing the same thing.</p><p>And I want to do it the right way, like everybody else, not just a famous figurehead that gets a job because he is a famous basketball player. I want to really learn the business.</p><p>There is no fulfillment in things whatsoever. And I think one of the reasons that depression reigns supreme amongst the rich and famous is some of them thought that maybe those things would bring them happiness. But what, in fact, does is having a cause, having a passion. And that&#39;s really what gives life&#39;s true meaning.</p><p>I don&#39;t mean being famous is a perk, because one knows that it&#39;s not necessarily a perk, but there are certain perks to being well-known and respected in one&#39;s field. Public perks. Like, I don&#39;t know, general friendliness and willingness to please, just to point out two.</p><p>The problem is, the more famous you get, the more people see you who didn&#39;t choose to.</p><p>Look at Jessica Simpson. She&#39;s famous for being dumb. I guess it started with Marylyn Monroe, and she actually wasn&#39;t that dumb, but that&#39;s how she was perceived - and that&#39;s what got popular.</p><p>Because you know when you first become famous, you start walking a little different because people are staring at you.</p><p>Exposure makes you famous, not just good work. Famous is being plastered everywhere.</p><p>I never pursued being &#39;famous.&#39;</p><p>I could have been a dental hygienist with nothing bad ever appearing in print about me, but that&#39;s not how I&#39;ve chosen to lead my life. I knew that you put yourself under a microscope the more famous you become.</p><p>I can&#39;t advise any of the young ones, because I don&#39;t know what their background was, but I would suggest that anyone who wants to be famous more than anything - there&#39;s a real problem.</p><p>I&#39;m sick to death of famous people standing up and using their celebrity to promote a cause. If I see a particular need, I do try to help. But there&#39;s a lot that can be achieved by putting a check in the right place and shutting up about it.</p><p>Barack Obama is the most famous living person in the history of the world.</p><p>Famous people come up to me, but I don&#39;t know who they are because my sight is so bad. It&#39;s always at the pool of the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills when I don&#39;t have my lenses in and my glasses are in my room.</p><p>I was famous overnight. I went from nowhere to being really big.</p><p>The worst thing about being famous is the invasion of your privacy.</p><p>Hitler was so modern, in that he was obsessed with being famous. He was caught up with this rush to be have achieved greatness before turning 30.</p><p>You know, I did not like being famous. It was a stressful and ugly time, and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over.</p><p>To enjoy being famous, you need to have a screw loose.</p><p>I&#39;d probably be famous now if I wasn&#39;t such a good waitress.</p><p>The whole &#39;American Idol&#39; way of looking at things is the antithesis of what I grew up with. There are a whole lot of kids wanting to be famous now, whereas if I&#39;d even mentioned that word to one of my teachers, I would have got into a whole load of trouble.</p><p>I became famous, I think, really because of the interpretation of other people&#39;s songs, way back when, and that&#39;s what I enjoy the most. And I&#39;m a lazy bugger.</p><p>There is this power that comes with being famous.</p><p>I would have been very happy just working from job to job, paying my rent one movie at a time. I never wanted to be this famous. I never imagined this life for myself.</p><p>I&#39;m willing to make compromises based on someone I think is the one, but I think it&#39;s psychologically important to people when they&#39;re famous to be the only famous person they know.</p><p>I just like the company of beautiful women. I have a weakness in that department. And I suppose because I am fairly well off and a famous musician, I&#39;m up for grabs. And that makes me an eligible bachelor in the press.</p><p>In the beginning, I loved being famous, but now I am tired of it and I would like to go back to my freedom.</p><p>There&#39;s a definite responsibility that comes with being famous. You shouldn&#39;t be able to just dress up and look pretty.</p><p>I have to say, you know, I&#39;ve seen so many people go through the cycle and become famous and not famous anymore and, you know, want - have their priorities change and want different things.</p><p>I woke up one morning to find I was famous. I bought a white Rolls-Royce and drove down Sunset Boulevard, wearing dark specs and a white suit, waving like the Queen Mum.</p><p>My mom just didn&#39;t put a very high premium on me being like really famous or really wealthy or anything.</p><p>I&#39;m not one of those famous people flying round the world emoting over every catastrophe. I&#39;m too feeble.</p><p>The first time I went to Johnny Depp&#39;s house in LA is when I realized what I was getting myself into. I knew he was famous, but I didn&#39;t really know what that entailed.</p><p>Duke Ellington was famous for hs very original harmonic patterns.</p><p>Why am I so famous? What am I doing right? What are the others doing wrong?</p><p>Being famous is just like being in high school. But I&#39;m not interested in being the cheerleader. I&#39;m not interested in being Gwen Stefani. She&#39;s the cheerleader, and I&#39;m out in the smoker shed.</p><p>The fire in the belly is essential, otherwise you become Michael Buble - famous and meaningless.</p><p>I kept saying that I&#39;d never live in L.A., and I didn&#39;t think I would. But that&#39;s where the work is, and I ended up making a lot of friends there, and my old friends moved out to Los Angeles too. And also, I think when you&#39;re famous, its hard to live in a small town.</p><p>I lost some of my friends because I got so famous, people who just assumed that I would be different now. I felt like everyone hated me. That is the most unhappy time of my life.</p><p>Who elected Larry King America&#39;s grief counselor? We, the viewing public, did, by driving up his ratings whenever somebody famous passes.</p><p>I have a great job writing for &#39;The Office,&#39; but, really, all television writers do is dream of one day writing movies. I&#39;ll put it this way: At the Oscars the most famous person in the room is, like, Angelina Jolie. At the Emmys the huge exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel. You get what I mean.</p><p>It took me fifteen years to discover I had no talent for writing, but I couldn&#39;t give it up because by that time I was too famous.</p><p>I know I&#39;m not a self-indulgent idiot I also know I&#39;m not the second coming of Deepak Chopra. If I had believed either of those, or both, as some people do when they get famous, that&#39;s when the mental illness arrives.</p><p>I know it&#39;s a cliche but I never wanted to be famous. I don&#39;t believe anybody wants to be famous.</p><p>A lot of people these days are not music lovers - they just want to be famous which is a very different thing to what I grew up believing in.</p><p>The love of the famous, like all strong passions, is quite abstract. Its intensity can be measured mathematically, and it is independent of persons.</p><p>I don&#39;t go to premieres. I don&#39;t go to parties. I don&#39;t covet the Oscar. I don&#39;t want any of that. I don&#39;t go out. I just have dinner at home every night with my kids. Being famous, that&#39;s a whole other career. And I haven&#39;t got any energy for it.</p><p>You aren&#39;t famous until my mother has heard of you.</p><p>My hair was famous before I was.</p><p>I&#39;m English. Our dentistry is not world famous.</p><p>Just because you&#39;re not famous, doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not good.</p><p>I hear the way people talk about the children of famous people. They&#39;re not treated very well. The presumptions are usually quite awful. So I tried to establish myself with a couple of movies. After &#39;Juno&#39; I thought: &#39;I think I&#39;ve defined myself enough as my own director that I&#39;d love to work with my father.&#39;</p><p>I&#39;ve been very, very lucky in my career, in my life - from day one. When aspiring directors say, &#39;What&#39;s your advice?&#39; first I say, &#39;Be born the son of a famous director. It&#39;s invaluable.&#39;</p><p>I have so much empathy for these young actors that are 19 and all of a sudden they&#39;re beautiful and famous and rich. I&#39;m like, &#39;Oh my God, I&#39;d be dead.&#39;</p><p>They saw me, those reckless seekers of beauty, and in a night I was famous.</p><p>Now, we believe that the majority of teachers in America know our system must be reformed, to put students first so that America can compete, that teachers don&#39;t teach to become rich or famous. They teach because they love children.</p><p>The stones themselves are thick with history, and those cats that dash through the alleyways must surely be the ghosts of the famous dead in feline disguise.</p><p>Well I would say that we&#39;re regular people first of all and we&#39;re normal and it&#39;s obvious by some of the things that have happened just because our name is famous we&#39;re not immune to tragedy.</p><p>A library, to modify the famous metaphor of Socrates, should be the delivery room for the birth of ideas - a place where history comes to life.</p><p>It&#39;s quite a famous story that takes place on Christmas Eve, and the Germans, French, and Scottish are trying to make peace one night and they bury their dead and they play football. I play a German opera singer, in German, which I never have so I am really excited about that.</p><p>I&#39;m not a very good impersonator, my friends maybe, but not famous people.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t glamorous in my day. In the regions, reporters were seen as such low life that they didn&#39;t merit their name in the Radio Times. Now people are interested in being famous. I never gave it a thought.</p><p>I never dreamt of being a musician for my livelihood. I certainly never would have wanted to be in the business that I&#39;m in, meaning the fame and the glory, the glitter, the rock star, the famous part.</p><p>I&#39;m as famous as I want to be.</p><p>Computers are famous for being able to do complicated things starting from simple programs.</p><p>The Bronx is famous for two things. Hip-hop, and 26 world championships.</p><p>I wanted to be famous. I wanted people to talk about me.</p><p>I know I have this level of celebrity, of fame, international, national, whatever you want to call it, but it&#39;s a pretty surreal thing to think sometimes that you&#39;re in the middle of another famous person&#39;s life and you think to yourself, &#39;How the hell did I get famous? What is this some weird club that we&#39;re in?&#39;</p><p>Fact is, famous people say fame stinks because they love it so - like a secret restaurant or holiday island they don&#39;t want the hoi polloi to get their grubby paws on.</p><p>Yeah, I like to be the maker of the art. And I like and want the money. But I don&#39;t really dig being famous.</p><p>Be very clear as to what your dream is. Nowadays it is fairly certain that 90 percent of all actors really just want to be rich and famous as the solution to all that ails.</p><p>I&#39;m famous today. People like me today. Might not like me tomorrow. You can&#39;t count on it.</p><p>I&#39;m glad that my parents missed one thing that was really unbelievable. They saw me hit this great success. It was a blast and we had a lot of laughs. And it was just an amazing time. They passed away. And then after I got, you know, famous, all these haters came out of nowhere.</p><p>As a famous person you think how you&#39;re gonna end it, get away and have a normal life.</p><p>If I wasn&#39;t even famous or had any success, I would still wake up and put tons of make-up on, and put on a cool outfit. That&#39;s always been who I&#39;ve been my whole life, so that&#39;s never gonna change. I love fashion. I love getting dressed up. I love Halloween, too.</p><p>There is less pressure as a character actor. It generally means that you will be acting for all of your life, which is my intention. It is not my intention to just be a rich and famous person, that would be pretty boring.</p><p>I felt so painfully isolated that I vowed I would get revenge on the world by becoming a famous cartoonist.</p><p>I really don&#39;t know anything else because my brothers were famous when I was two years old. So I know nothing else, no other life.</p><p>If somebody for some reason, for music or for movie, becomes famous, it&#39;s because they have something, something special.</p><p>The press attack people to sell more papers without thinking, but when you get famous you have to put up with this kind of stuff.</p><p>There are people who appear in the magazines and I don&#39;t know who they are. I&#39;ve never seen anything they&#39;ve done and their careers are over already. They&#39;re famous for maybe 10 minutes. Real careers, I think, take a long time to unfold.</p><p>I&#39;ve only ever wanted to be a singer I never wanted to be famous.</p><p>Because I think in order to get famous you have to be known for something. Like &#39;You&#39;re the romantic comedy girl&#39; or &#39;You&#39;re the Oscar-winning whatever girl.&#39;</p><p>Our top story tonight: Famous TV dolphin flipper was arrested today on prostitution ring charges. He allegedly was seen transporting two 16 year olds across state line for immoral porpoises.</p><p>I never wanted to be a celebrity I never wanted to be famous. And in my daily life, I work really hard to not trade on it in any way.</p><p>I mean I was famous for nothing.</p><p>I didn&#39;t want kids to think that to be happy, they had to be famous or rich or live in the big city.</p><p>Becoming famous is a strange thing in your own right.</p><p>When you see a fantastic colour or cut in a magazine, perched up on some famous so-and-so&#39;s head, it&#39;s tempting to ask your stylist for the same, but do not be fooled. The hair in those fancy photos can be very high maintenance.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel famous and I didn&#39;t want my autobiography to be like a Paris Hilton story.</p><p>I always loved working as an actress, but I didn&#39;t understand why I couldn&#39;t just opt out of being famous. And then I realized you can, and I think I did. And eventually, I came to understand that you can do that and also keep working.</p><p>I would like to prove that on TV, everyday lives can be as compelling as the life-styles of the rich and famous. Especially lives that we catch at extraordinary moments.</p><p>I would be a huge hypocrite if I didn&#39;t tell you that at one time in my life I thought the way that you made music was you got on a major label and you got famous.</p><p>We need to teach our kids, because there is such a celebrity culture at the moment, that however rich you are, however famous you are, however glamorous you are, everyone has to live by the same rules.</p><p>I don&#39;t have many famous friends, really, except Simon Cowell.</p><p>Usually when I see someone famous, for some reason, I think I know them.</p><p>My goal was just to work regularly. I didn&#39;t ever expect to be rich or famous. I wanted to be a working character actor.</p><p>I got the famous Oprah hug!</p><p>There are hundreds of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings around the United States and in other countries, too. Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.</p><p>I became famous so quickly and so young - it was daunting. I was immature and I used to say some really stupid things in interviews. I never smiled on stage so I looked really serious, but it was because I hated my teeth and was incredibly nervous.</p><p>There&#39;s the famous thing that the A&amp;ampR man from the record company is supposed to do: He&#39;s supposed to come into the studio and listen to the songs you&#39;ve been recording and then say, &#39;Guys, I don&#39;t hear any singles.&#39; And then everybody falls into a terrible depression because you have to write one.</p><p>I think basically becoming famous has taken the place of going to Heaven in modern society, hasn&#39;t it? That&#39;s the place where your dreams will come true. It&#39;s an act of faith now they think that&#39;s going to sort things out.</p><p>As a shy kid growing up in Sheffield, I fantasized about how it would be great to be famous so I wouldn&#39;t actually have to talk to people and feel awkward. And of course, as we all know from fairy stories, when you achieve that ambition, you find out you don&#39;t want it.</p><p>Pulp existed for 12 years before we got famous. Now, you could say that was just lack of imagination, but it&#39;s some kind of quality isn&#39;t it? Tenacity. You could also say it was sloth.</p><p>I had no desire to be famous I just wanted to make the greatest music ever made. I didn&#39;t want anyone to know who I was.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be famous. I want to be secure. I don&#39;t want the world. I just want a piece of it. I want people to remember Eric Davis.</p><p>You do not want to get married at 22! Especially if you&#39;re famous, because girls are going to be throwing themselves at you.</p><p>When you look at Michael Jackson, there&#39;s nobody who loves him in that family, nobody. If they did, they&#39;d tell him he didn&#39;t have to do all that in order to be famous. All he has to do is keep doing his music and be himself. Michael&#39;s been a little touched for about 20 years, but somebody needs to pull him aside and tell him they love him.</p><p>When I was growing up, I thought I&#39;d be a lot happier if I was famous and successful and if I had money.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if this is the kind of retrospective analysis that people are fond of applying to their work or actions, but it feels like I knew I was going to be famous and I knew that an element of that would be traumatic, so that if I could make myself something big and otherworldly, it would be a kind of defence.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/quotes/edit/main/src/guide/I hate failure.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/I%20can%20imagine.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>I can imagine</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/I%20have%20always.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>I have always</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
