been my purpose to become an American icon, or more famous or richer.</p><p>I didn&#39;t get hugely famous really quick. It was a slow, gradual process, so I was able to sort of grow into myself and figure out who I was and what I wanted without the glaring spotlight on me telling me who I was.</p><p>Major success feels a bit like a coronation. Like I&#39;d become a king. I was one of the most famous people in the world, loved and hated in equal measure. I couldn&#39;t see anything bad with it. It made me a happy person.</p><p>I&#39;m the man that made wrestling famous.</p><p>I&#39;ve had to deal, a lot, with my own sense of intimidation at meeting famous people - especially actors, but really any famous people.</p><p>It is more interesting to be compared to someone famous, because it lets you gauge what perceptions people have about your appearance.</p><p>Nobody wants to end up super rich and famous - but divorced. I&#39;m always clear on that and try to stay on the right side of the line.</p><p>When famous people come up to you it&#39;s a bit weird, but it&#39;s an honour, really, when they recognise you and want to chat to you for a bit.</p><p>I was very famous as a young man and I celebrated both the good and bad times with drinking.</p><p>But I didn&#39;t ask to have somebody nose around in my private life. I didn&#39;t even ask to be famous. All I asked was to be able to earn a living making people laugh.</p><p>You can become famous but you can&#39;t become unfamous. You can become infamous but not unfamous.</p><p>Being famous is great, it&#39;s not like bad or horrible or anything.</p><p>I love being famous - it&#39;s phenomenal.</p><p>Being famous is not something that would make me feel successful - unless one was striving for mediocrity.</p><p>There are a lot of good things about being famous but there are a few not so good things too.</p><p>I hope this doesn&#39;t sound pompous but I don&#39;t think of myself as famous, whatever fame I&#39;ve got has come through what I&#39;ve done and associations of things I&#39;ve done.</p><p>You meet people in Hollywood that are famous, and you&#39;re not sure what they got famous for.</p><p>In a school where everyone is famous or rich or whatever, you have a culture, &#39;What does your dad do?&#39; &#39;What does your mom do?&#39;</p><p>I think in the end, when you&#39;re famous, people like to narrow you down to a few personality traits. I think I&#39;ve just become this ambitious, say-whatever&#39;s-on-her-mind, intimidating person. And that&#39;s part of my personality, but it&#39;s certainly not anywhere near the whole thing.</p><p>A lot of times on tour it&#39;s about, &#39;OK, where am I today? Wow, I&#39;m in Costa Rica. What is their famous dish?&#39; And it&#39;s about trying the food, and really experiencing it.</p><p>I&#39;m famous for splurging at fast-food places. I&#39;m currently obsessed with Taco Bell&#39;s bean and cheese burritos with extra green sauce and extra cheese. Gluttony!</p><p>You can be famous for a lot of things. You can be a Nobel-prize winner. You can be the fattest guy in the world.</p><p>I know somebody from university who&#39;s called Phil Collins and I think there&#39;s something terribly unfortunate about sharing a name With somebody who either is famous or becomes famous.</p><p>I&#39;ve noticed that once you leave London you do kind of become a bit more famous. People in London are a bit too cool for school. It&#39;s not so unusual to see someone from London in the street. But outside of London people are a bit more excited to see you and come out and support you.</p><p>I don&#39;t have famous neighbours and if I did, I&#39;d avoid them. I don&#39;t live the jet-set.</p><p>People don&#39;t get through to the essence of you right away - it&#39;s always the famous &#39;girl&#39; or the famous &#39;girlfriend&#39;. I&#39;d rather be known for myself.</p><p>What is a movie star? It is an illusion. It was everything I ever wanted to be, but it became a kind of shell, non? It was what made me famous and got me women. But it wasn&#39;t real.</p><p>You know, one of the biggest thrills I have is when famous people recognize me from Taxi.</p><p>Anytime you cast a movie and you need someone famous in the lead part, you&#39;re a prisoner of whoever happens to be famous in the six-month window in which you&#39;re trying to get a film financed.</p><p>When you&#39;re rich and famous you are the dominant force in a relationship, even if you try hard not to be. I&#39;ve talked of sacrificing everything for Fleetwood Mac, but I realize now that it is simply the only thing I&#39;ve ever wanted to do.</p><p>I just think Rosa Parks was overrated. Last time I checked, she got famous for breaking the law.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t being an alcoholic - it was going wild. It happened when I got famous. It was like having my teens in my early thirties: blotting out your life, not having to think about anything.</p><p>I remember Michael saying, &#39;Rich and famous? It&#39;s much better to be just rich&#39;. I didn&#39;t quite get it to begin with. But he&#39;s right. You lose anonymity. I say to my family that you&#39;ve no idea until you lose it how precious anonymity is.</p><p>I want to thank all the women who have worn my clothes, the famous and the unknown, who have been so faithful to me and given me so much joy.</p><p>It was deeply important for me to understand where Mandela came from. Because we know where he was going, and that&#39;s a famous story, but who was he? Where did he come from? What was his upbringing?</p><p>I had a sense of who I was before I got famous.</p><p>I really feel like it&#39;s a travesty to make a child famous. I really do.</p><p>Being famous hasn&#39;t changed my perception of myself - I&#39;ve just grown up.</p><p>I have never wanted to be famous, as such - fame is a by-product.</p><p>Actually, bizarrely, in America, I get more appreciation from the odd, unusual stuff I&#39;ve done, almost because I&#39;m not, if you like, famous in America as I am in England.</p><p>You&#39;ve got certain guys that just want to be famous and then you&#39;ve got the real musicians that just love playing music.</p><p>Save your rejections so that later when you are famous you can show them to people and laugh.</p><p>HBO is really famous for hiring good people and staying out of their way until they ask for help, or need it. And that reputation is earned.</p><p>Ever since grammar school, I knew I wanted to be famous - I always wanted to be a singer.</p><p>Being famous is wicked. But it&#39;s better to be normal.</p><p>None of my characters are rich or famous, and the situations they find themselves in could happen to anyone.</p><p>You know, be an actor because you love to act. Don&#39;t be an actor because you think you&#39;re going to get famous, because that&#39;s luck.</p><p>I&#39;m actually about as famous as a fourth division footballer from the 70s.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know what to expect from a famous movie star maybe that he&#39;d be sort of stuck-up, you know. But not Gary Cooper. He horsed around so much... that I had a hard time painting him.</p><p>I don&#39;t really consider myself to be famous.</p><p>I was obsessed with being rich and famous.</p><p>Luckily, I think, I never really wanted to be famous, I just wanted to make movies.</p><p>I remember, when I was an up-and-coming comic, how annoyed I would be when the famous guys would show up and just take everyone&#39;s spots.</p><p>The good thing about L.A. is that there&#39;s always someone more famous 100 yards away from me.</p><p>Exploitation films were famous for taking an issue an exploiting it because they could move much faster than a studio could. If there was any hot topic, they would run out and make a quick movie and make a buck on it, by changing it around and using it, in some way, to give some relevance.</p><p>The people I want are very famous and very rich, and all I can offer them is a bit of exposure on TV and a bit of cash, so it&#39;s a miracle we get any guests at all. But we have been very lucky.</p><p>I met a lot of famous people when I was about 24. And none of them seemed very appealing. And so I didn&#39;t know why I would struggle to be that kind of person.</p><p>I think that as soon as you think of yourself as a famous person or anything like that, you&#39;re objectifying yourself in some weird way.</p><p>Some people want fame, popularity and huge sales. I&#39;ve always hoped to have a really long career. So I&#39;ve tried to make each of my creative decisions and business decisions to allow for longevity. As a side effect I got really famous and really big. I didn&#39;t realize the two could go together.</p><p>For now I&#39;m just enjoying being a mom. I don&#39;t want to be more famous and more rich. I want to be a good mom.</p><p>No one can train you to be famous. How do you deal with the loss of anonymity, the loss of privacy? You have to be disciplined.</p><p>I never wanted to be the most famous, the most beautiful, the most extravagant.</p><p>It&#39;s always a little mind-boggling to realize that these famous actors know who I am.</p><p>I think that once you open the door and allow people in on a certain aspect, it&#39;s very hard to then control how far that ripple effect is. So I think that the person who is known or famous has the ability to decide what they do or don&#39;t want to share.</p><p>I definitely wanted to be an actor. I didn&#39;t want to be on TV, I didn&#39;t want to be famous, I didn&#39;t want to be anyone in particular I just wanted to do it. I see young people now who look at magazines, or American Idol and their goal is to have that lifestyle - to have good handbags, or go out with cute guys from shows, or whatever. But I definitely wanted to be an actor.</p><p>I&#39;m not famous for my back story investigations I&#39;m lucky that I work with good writers and it&#39;s usually in the script.</p><p>I know really, really famous people who are terrified every time they walk on to a stage.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about writing a book or getting famous or making money. Just lead an interesting life.</p><p>I walk the streets, take the train, it&#39;s real simple. Some actors create their own mythology: &#39;Oh, I&#39;m so famous I can&#39;t go places, because I created this mythology that I&#39;m so famous I can&#39;t go places.&#39;</p><p>My wife Elizabeth and I started The Really Terrible Orchestra for people like us who are pretty hopeless musicians who would like to play in an orchestra. It has been a great success. We give performances we&#39;ve become the most famous bad orchestra in the world.</p><p>The records of adopted children are sealed in California. That seal is considered inviolable... The judge ruled that, because I was famous, he didn&#39;t have the same rights as other kids.</p><p>People are much more inclined to believe and say bad things about you if you&#39;re famous.</p><p>I never wanted to do biography just to tell the life of a famous man. I always wanted to use the life of a man to examine political power, because democracy shapes our lives.</p><p>I could have been more famous if I did all the glitzy things, but celebrity always seemed so unnecessary.</p><p>I&#39;d love to live in Ireland but I&#39;d like to live as me, not what someone thinks I am. People don&#39;t understand - I lived there before I was famous.</p><p>Being famous was extremely disappointing for me. When I became famous it was a complete drag and it is still a complete drag.</p><p>Our most famous writers are Faulkner and Eudora Welty and Flannery O&#39;Connor. It would make sense that the poetry would reflect some of those same values, some of the same techniques.</p><p>Quite often I can be in a bookshop, standing beneath a great big picture of myself and paying for a book with a credit card clearly marked John Grisham, yet no one recognises me. I often say I&#39;m a famous author in a country where no one reads.</p><p>The hardest thing about being famous is that people are always nice to you.</p><p>I&#39;ve been accustomed to being famous and having a certain level of attention for 14 years, but in the last few months, it&#39;s changed. It&#39;s like on the arcade game, I&#39;ve gone up to the next level.</p><p>I literally was famous before I knew my own name.</p><p>My discrepancy with children in the industry is that they are made famous before they know who they are as human beings.</p><p>It&#39;s more important for me to feel content than to be famous.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever feel as famous or as popular as I felt when I was a 17-year-old soccer player in Modle. Only about 20,000 people live there and 12,000 of them come to every game. Running onto the pitch each week was just the most fantastic feeling. Nothing can beat that.</p><p>I get very nervous around famous people and I get nervous around beautiful women.</p><p>I certainly don&#39;t want a child of mine to be famous, or anyone I was very close to who isn&#39;t yet... It&#39;s the worst thing to be trapped in your house not be able to leave.</p><p>Nobody makes bouillabaisse from scratch. It&#39;s all a bunch of malarkey. Even the restaurants buy a commercial-grade product. I had a very famous chef tell me that.</p><p>I feel very strong as an individual, but as a famous footballer I know I am prone to certain things. All the media have a continuous interest for me. It varies from once a year to every day interest.</p><p>There aren&#39;t many downsides to being rich, other than paying taxes and having relatives asking for money. But being famous, that&#39;s a 24 hour job right there.</p><p>When I was younger, I used to say, One day I&#39;ll be famous.</p><p>For me, getting comfortable with being famous was hard - that whole side of it, the loss of anonymity, the loss of privacy. Giving up that part of your life and not having control of it.</p><p>I married a pretty famous girl, and when we drive through town there&#39;s usually a car following us, when I walk out of my front door in Chelsea there&#39;s six guys waiting for me.</p><p>First of all, plain and simple, you have no real idea of what it means to be famous until you become famous. It&#39;s a double-edged sword. Obviously there are a lot of amazing things about fame, but there are also a lot of challenging things about it.</p><p>The only reason I became the singer in the band is because I sang the best. It wasn&#39;t out of some desire to be a star or be a famous singer. It&#39;s not like I love interviews.</p><p>Famous people feel that they must perpetually be on the crest of the wave, not realising that it is against all the rules of life. You can&#39;t be on top all the time, it isn&#39;t natural.</p><p>When I was 24, I was full of life. I was that ham who wanted to be famous, a movie star, all that stuff. I think it&#39;s cool. But it was not what I was searching for, really. It was more a delusion.</p><p>There has been a time on earth when poets had been young and dead and famous - and were men. But now the poet as the tragic child of grandeur and destiny had changed. The child of genius was a woman, now, and the man was gone.</p><p>I&#39;d had people say, &#39;You&#39;ll enjoy being famous for a week, and you&#39;ll never enjoy it again&#39;. But I don&#39;t think I had that week. I may have been working and missed that moment.</p><p>Sometimes I like to play the soundtracks to famous musicals so we can all sing along. South Pacific is one of my favorites. Our neighbors must hate us.</p><p>Famous pivot stories are often failures but you don&#39;t need to fail before you pivot. All a pivot is is a change is strategy without a change in vision.

And that&#39;s the advice I give to younger aspiring actors. Work onstage and do the little roles. In the end it&#39;s not important to be seen. It&#39;s important to do.

I think fame should come along with success, talent.</p><p>Quite frankly, I didn&#39;t become an actor to become a movie star. I have never dreamed about being the most famous person on the planet. I just want to do really good work.</p><p>That the work involved, the willingness to take chances, the commitment, the opportunity to get on stage and make people happy, was more important than becoming famous, or even what I was dancing.</p><p>I&#39;m world famous, everywhere I go there are people who love me because of I&#39;ve been able to bring them some joy from the movies I&#39;ve made.</p><p>There are high spots in all of our lives and most of them have come about through encouragement from someone else.

I never wanted to be a big, famous movie star and TV star. It kind of found me.</p><p>To be famous and broke is hard.</p><p>I&#39;ve always had confidence.

So, I don&#39;t know what put that bug in me at a young age.</p><p>You do now have one in three people, as shown by the famous Carlton Monarchy debate poll, saying they want to get rid of the Monarchy.

There is a lot more competition, a lot of countries in the East have opened up so there are many more models than there were in the Nineties. Now they have to compete with famous actresses but also with, say, reality stars to be on the magazine covers.</p><p>There&#39;s this common perception that having a famous last name is all you need. A surname may get you a meeting, but if there&#39;s no talent you won&#39;t get the part.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be famous famous.

And that&#39;s fine, it gets them in the door, but then it&#39;s my job to give them something different.</p><p>I think that people who are famous tend to be underdeveloped in their humanity skills.</p><p>I keep saying I&#39;m not at all famous in my own country, because people do not think I have done anything for India.</p><p>I&#39;m a bit jealous.

I remember David Harewood doing &#39;Othello&#39; at the National, and Adrian Lester having done Cheek by Jowl&#39;s famous &#39;As You Like It and Company&#39; at the Donmar. Not necessarily performances I saw, but just the fact they happened was massively encouraging.</p><p>Famous crime stories almost always lead to the passing of new laws.</p><p>I never feel so utterly fraudulent as when I review a movie whose charms impress all in the world and I simply do not get it. The other variant is that I love something the world disdains. This has had severe career consequences: I am still famous - or notorious - in certain quarters where I am recalled as the man who liked &#39;Hudson Hawk.&#39;</p><p>I don&#39;t ever want to be hugely famous because I had a little taste of it after &#39;East Is East&#39; and &#39;Bend It.&#39;</p><p>It&#39;s been real weird. It wasn&#39;t how I expected my life to turn out. Especially, mainly pertaining to the show.

It took me a long time to appreciate that.</p><p>I don&#39;t really know a lot of famous people. I&#39;ve met a lot of famous people.

I had some relations, once also to a famous pop star.</p><p>You can be a famous poisoner or a successful poisoner, but not both, and the same seems to apply to Great Train Robbers.</p><p>Kids will keep it real. If I&#39;ve ever had in my life a great anchor, it&#39;s them. They get in your head, &#39;don&#39;t get too famous.&#39; If you think you&#39;re really famous and think you&#39;re really hip, go hang out with your kids for an afternoon. That&#39;s about as earthbound as it&#39;s going to get.</p><p>Being famous gets me good concert tickets, good tables in restaurants, good seats at sporting events and that&#39;s really about it.</p><p>To seduce a woman famous for strict morals, religious fervor and the happiness of her marriage: what could possibly be more prestigious?</p><p>Being famous before you&#39;ve formed your personality, before you have that self-esteem, is dangerous.</p><p>When you&#39;re a famous, successful person at 16 years old, the rules change for you.

And I think you miss out on lot of growing up and a lot of reality checks.</p><p>Whenever I&#39;m in theatre situations I will go out of my way not to talk about my father, but in the film world I can be really proud of my family and say, &#39;You know what: my dad&#39;s a really, really famous theatre director,&#39; because nobody has any idea.</p><p>The advantage of taking pictures of the famous is that they get published.</p><p>I was famous from birth.</p><p>I am famous because I am an African American jazz artist.</p><p>I made a conscious decision back then that I would rather be the best actress who ever lived than the most famous one.</p><p>The real harm of term extension comes not from these famous works.

So I come from very famous lineage. Granted, they didn&#39;t have cameras back then, so none of them had TV shows.</p><p>I do not like being famous. I like being normal.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been more drawn to being normal than being famous.</p><p>I have actor friends, but they&#39;re not famous. I feel like if you&#39;re an actor or - famous, you have to overly prove that you&#39;re a normal, cool person.</p><p>It&#39;s not my goal to be a famous actor.</p><p>I think it&#39;s really important for celebrities to use their power of money and fame to get their voices out there. It&#39;s funny to me that we&#39;re expected to keep quiet just because of who we are. Why do I lose my right to speak my mind because I&#39;m famous?</p><p>I don&#39;t like being famous - it is like a prison.

The idea of it really scares me.</p><p>If you ever get rich and famous, by definition you are special. You have done something special, and therefore you start to behave special. Then if the floor drops out, and you become down and out, you have a really new perspective.</p><p>I had a flight trainer who is one of the biggest and most famous helicopter pilots the world.</p><p>I was never famous as a kid. That&#39;s the biggest difference between me and any other kid actor is that I wasn&#39;t famous as a kid.</p><p>I do not take any pleasure whatsoever in being a famous person.</p><p>I never wanted to be rich or successful or famous. I just wanted to be happy and have fun.</p><p>And I don&#39;t want to live anywhere where I am famous. It makes me very, very uncomfortable, because it conveys an advantage over people, and I don&#39;t like that.</p><p>It&#39;s horrible how money and fame can make you acceptable while, if you&#39;re not famous or rich, you&#39;re not acceptable.</p><p>I guess the nicest thing about being, I won&#39;t say famous but being popular is a more proper word for me to use would be that if you&#39;ve got a recognizable name, a lot of times you can get people to do things for you ordinarily that you wouldn&#39;t get done.</p><p>Celebrities say they date other celebrities because they have the same job.

I got very famous for a minute and then it just all went away, you know?</p><p>I got very famous for a minute and then it just all went away, you know? And for the last 20 years - you&#39;ve got to pick yourself up and dust yourself off and then go on your merry way and start again, in a sense, and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing.</p><p>I don&#39;t like the idea of famous people.</p><p>The most famous person in my phone is Lindsay Lohan.

It&#39;s not to be famous.</p><p>I worked on scores. I went to the musical library in Berlin which is very famous. I discovered that we had scores of Beethoven, printed scores of Beethoven, that are full of mistakes. Not the wrong or false notes, but the wrong dynamic, understandable things.</p><p>I was in a karaoke video in 1991, for a song called &#39;Sukiyaki,&#39; which is a very famous Japanese song, and I&#39;ve actually heard from people that they&#39;ve been in bars in Asia where they&#39;ve seen me come up in the &#39;Sukiyaki&#39; video that they play behind you.

I became a celebrity overnight and people see me as a famous skater, not a real person.</p><p>When I first became famous, I didn&#39;t know if I could go where I wanted to because I didn&#39;t know how people were going to act. Some folks would scream and holler, and I didn&#39;t know what to do with that.</p><p>In a lot of aspects it&#39;s cooler that we don&#39;t have a lot of really overly famous people in the band.</p><p>Look at Gleason in The Honeymooners. He was humorous but the way he lived wasn&#39;t really humorous. He was a bus driver. Who wants to be a bus driver? He didn&#39;t have any money and he was not famous. But despite that, the show is humorous.</p><p>No matter how famous and established they were or however blessed they were with great songs or long careers, if they lived alone, they lived alone. That&#39;s not the way I wanted to live prior to the tour or after.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had a desire to be famous. Lots of actors are actually extremely shy.

I had the famous &#39;89 fight with Nicole, which she admits that she initiated the physical part.</p><p>For somebody famous, it&#39;s weird anyway to meet someone, because they have a preconceived notion of who you are.</p><p>I didn&#39;t want to be famous. I just wanted to earn enough money to have a nice life and enjoy acting.</p><p>But just playing the partner of someone famous, I had a lot more freedom.</p><p>I&#39;m officially near-famous. If you&#39;ve got four year old kids and you&#39;ve got cable, then you&#39;ve got no choice but to know who I am. But if you&#39;re one of my peers - a 26-year old guy who lives in Manhattan - you have no idea who I am. I&#39;m only famous if you&#39;re four.</p><p>I&#39;m terrified of being too famous. What I&#39;m really afraid of is that the audiences will go into the theater and not be able to forget that it&#39;s me, that fame will stand in the way of my acting. I want to keep being able to change into different shapes and different personalities.</p><p>In fact, I&#39;d just like to own something.

You just have to be an ordinary person, doing extraordinary things. I&#39;d like more people to know that it&#39;s there. Women&#39;s achievements still aren&#39;t recognised enough in many areas.</p><p>When I was a kid, the idea of why I wanted acting to be the thing I do for the rest of my life was different. It was, Oh yeah, I&#39;ll get girls and be famous.</p><p>I think anybody who&#39;s famous has to deal with their fame in their own way, and I dealt with it by making a film about a kid who&#39;s looking out into the world of celebrity obsession.</p><p>I&#39;ve been around some very famous people, but no one has the effect Maradona has people tremble in his presence.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how to construct a career that&#39;ll make me famous. Except maybe get my ears pinned back, get my teeth done, and go to America. But then I&#39;ll be competing with billions of actors who haven&#39;t got false teeth, and who are 25.</p><p>I just want to be rich and famous.</p><p>My philosophy was, if I just do good work, someone will like it enough to employ me. It never made me famous. And I&#39;m way, way too old now, mate. That boat&#39;s sailed.</p><p>We were delighted to have Nigel as a producer. The only problem is that Nigel is so famous that he seems to dominate most interviews without being there.</p><p>George Harrison was also a pleasure to work with. He was one of the most famous people I&#39;ve ever known, but in spite of that fame, he was such a nice and friendly guy.</p><p>I think I&#39;ll always be famous. I just hope I don&#39;t become infamous.</p><p>I never set out to become &#39;famous.&#39; I mean, when you&#39;re 14 you think &#39;I&#39;m gonna become a writer and people will want my autograph and that&#39;ll be cool,&#39; but you grow up and you learn that&#39;s just not how the world works. I resigned myself to the fact that I would probably never be published and if I did it probably wouldn&#39;t be a big deal.</p><p>On the other hand, when I give it closer thought, I realize I&#39;m not enough of a dictator to conduct an orchestra because it requires a pretty awful person. When you read these biographies of famous conductors, they are all awful people who fail in their private relationships.</p><p>There are a lot of famous comedians from Liverpool, then obviously the Beatles, and the football club. That&#39;s what people in Liverpool are passionate about.</p><p>I just don&#39;t feel much interested in the lifestyles of the rich and famous.</p><p>Of course there have been times I regretted being the kid in &#39;E.T.&#39; My world went completely crazy. I was that stupid kind of famous, where you can&#39;t go anywhere.</p><p>Hollywood people want to build you up and make you famous only to knock you off you&#39;re the pedestal they built for you.</p><p>I was with a famous comedian when a young fan walked up and asked for an autograph. The comedian blew him off. I&#39;ll never forget the look on the young boy&#39;s face. He was devastated.</p><p>I really had little interest in becoming famous. When I write my book, it will be my guide to avoid becoming a rock star.</p><p>They used to but not any more. You kind of get used to it - you accept it is part of your job - if you&#39;re famous and you want this life, you have got to accept this part of it as well.</p><p>I love singing - singing is what I&#39;m famous for doing. Now it&#39;s turned into things I am famous for doing - like having rows with my mum or about my boyfriend, so it does get irritating.</p><p>To put it simply - you know, a lot of people believe that the benefit of this job is fame and fortune. I believe that you pay for the fortune through the fame. I don&#39;t buy into the notion that being famous is somehow a good thing, or an exciting thing, or a wonderful thing.</p><p>I didn&#39;t get into skating to be famous.</p><p>It&#39;s not a sport you get famous at. If I wanted to be famous, I would have stuck with hockey.</p><p>When I started on MySpace, people wanted to support me, but once I rose to fame with the MTV show, they felt like I had abandoned them for some reason, that I was too famous to talk to them anymore.</p><p>Thus, after finishing high school, I started with high expectations and enthusiasm to study chemistry at the famous Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.</p><p>All my life, it&#39;s been the same with men. Being a woman who is famous and adored by men is very hard for any boyfriend to handle. All my boyfriends end up insecure.</p><p>I guess we decided to make a new record 3 years ago when Nancy was done scoring for Almost Famous.</p><p>Well, yeah. At a certain point, you&#39;ve got to be really honest with yourself. Like, &#39;Why am I doing this? What are my motivations?&#39; Like, if you get into it because you want to be famous? Then you&#39;ve got a long row to hoe. But if you really feel like it&#39;s a labour of love and it&#39;s something you&#39;re actually legitimately good at, then it&#39;s not that hard to keep plugging away.</p><p>Being rich and famous isn&#39;t all happiness and at times the pressures have got to me.</p><p>I&#39;ve learned to stay away from publicity addicts, people who want to be famous for no reason.</p><p>I believe some people in this business suffer from fame because they behave in a famous fashion.</p><p>You&#39;ll know if you&#39;re a famous composer if 20 years from now your name appears on a pull-down menu in Band in a Box, alongside Hans Zimmer.</p><p>I think it&#39;s real easy to be famous these days it&#39;s not real easy to sustain success.</p><p>I worked at a hot dog place, a bagel place, the Jersey Store and the hottest fashion joint around. I was getting too famous to work there anymore. I was almost showing up as a joke. I made $2,000 on my show the previous night and I&#39;m going to go shopping during my five-hour shift.</p><p>I&#39;m learning as I go. I don&#39;t know everything. I never had anybody to look at, nobody ever taught me, and where I&#39;m from I didn&#39;t have any famous role models.</p><p>I&#39;m famous for being nicer to my fans than anyone on the face of the earth because I figure, a) They pay my salary, and b) It&#39;s probably like a big moment in your life to meet somebody so I would say, &#39;Just come on up.&#39;</p><p>It struck me that working digitally with a small crew, I could lay out a general plan for Famous and hope for mistakes which would create something more than satire and something less than truthful reality.</p><p>The excitement for me lies not so much in interviewing the hard-to-get famous person, but the person whom you are about to discover. You know, like maybe the character actors who are just coming into their own and you&#39;re realizing how great they are.</p><p>There&#39;s so many things I want to do. I want to work with great filmmakers, great actors, great scripts. And there&#39;s no reason for me to do anything short of that, because I&#39;m 24, I don&#39;t have a family, I don&#39;t need to make tons of money, and I&#39;m not dying to get famous.</p><p>The world&#39;s most famous and popular language is music.</p><p>One of the hardest things for me, now that I&#39;m famous, is finding people who can read my stuff and give me an honest critique.</p><p>One thing I think celebrities shy away from is exposing the reality that we&#39;re all the same. Somebody&#39;s not more important because they have a Bentley or a big house or a famous boyfriend or plastic surgery - we&#39;re all the same.</p><p>There&#39;s such big pressure on people who are incredibly famous, on those who have people sitting outside their front door and taking photos every time they move.</p><p>I never set out to be rich and famous. I wanted to follow my own path.</p><p>In approaching our subject it will be best, without attempting to shorten the path by referring to famous theories of the drama, to start directly from the facts, and to collect from them gradually an idea of Shakespearean Tragedy.</p><p>In Germany I am not so famous.</p><p>Thank God I arrived the day before yesterday, the first of the month, at this port of San Diego, truly a fine one, and not without reason called famous.</p><p>I&#39;ve wanted to perform my entire life. I found a paper I wrote in kindergarten class about what I wanted to be when I grew up - and I wrote &#39;a famous singer!&#39;</p><p>I&#39;m just not a private person. It&#39;s not like I do things because I want things to be public it&#39;s just that&#39;s my way of expressing myself, and I happen to be very famous.</p><p>My goal was not to be famous or rich but to be good at what I did. And that required going to New York and studying and working in the theater.</p><p>I used to think no one should go into show biz, but now I feel differently. I now feel like it&#39;s a great career. If you can do it and make money at it and still not be so famous that you can have a normal life - then I think it&#39;s a great career.</p><p>You&#39;re asking the wrong girl about fame. I&#39;m hardly famous. I wouldn&#39;t want to trade places with anyone else.</p><p>Why does anybody want to be famous? You know what&#39;s important to me? Having lunch! Pasta! Seeing my friends! Is that so crazy?</p><p>I&#39;m hardly famous. I wouldn&#39;t want to trade places with anyone else.</p><p>Sonny and another Hells Angel who was at the meeting thought they were beyond a little patch so they headed down to a local tattoo shop in Oakland and were the first to get the famous One Percent tattoos.</p><p>When someone becomes successful or rich and famous, people perceive that person as being different. But I&#39;m the same guy I&#39;ve always been.</p><p>I did grow up next door to Steve McQueen, who was a very famous movie star at the time, but as a kid it didn&#39;t impress me. We always had great fun with him. He would take us out on Sundays on his motorcycles, riding around in the desert he was like a second father.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to have a bad hair day when you&#39;re famous.</p><p>I&#39;m not unknown, yet I&#39;m not super famous where I can&#39;t go anywhere.</p><p>I like photographing the people I love, the people I admire, the famous, and especially the infamous. My last infamous subject was the extreme right wing French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen.</p><p>I don&#39;t have any expectations as an actor and being rich and famous is not my driving force.</p><p>The seven wise men of Greece, so famous for their wisdom all the world over, acquired all that fame, each of them, by a single sentence consisting of two or three words.</p><p>I totally related to Cole Porter&#39;s magnetic pull to any piano that was in the room, which he was famous for doing, as was Gershwin. You couldn&#39;t drag them away from a piano.</p><p>Celebrity culture, it&#39;s everywhere, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s reality TV, Big Brother. I didn&#39;t become a footballer to be famous, I became a footballer to be successful. I didn&#39;t want to be famous. Now people want to be famous. Why? Why would you want people following you about all day?</p><p>Being famous as a writer is like being famous in a village. It&#39;s not really any very heady fame.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be famous per se, but I want to write books for as long as I can. And I plan on writing a lot.</p><p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to become famous or that I&#39;m obsessed by my work as an actress, but it&#39;s all about not limiting myself, such as putting myself in a little jail that I can escape from.</p><p>I heard so many stories from Gaomi&#39;s peasants that I had an irrepressible urge to write them down. Today, Gaomi&#39;s peasants know that they have become famous around the world through my writings, but I think they are a little puzzled by this.</p><p>I don&#39;t care how famous a guitarist is, he ain&#39;t learned everything. There&#39;s always somewhere to go, something to mash up, but he ain&#39;t found it yet. You never learn everything on that guitar neck.</p><p>Normally, I name my characters after famous comedians.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be famous as a movie star and have the whole world love me, I want to be a creative actress.</p><p>I&#39;m really not for famous people who design a line for a company, when you know it&#39;s not really them creating it but a team of designers, especially when there are so many talented people who&#39;ve taken the time to go and study fashion.</p><p>Those who have known the famous are publicly debriefed of their memories, knowing as their own dusk falls that they will only be remembered for remembering someone else.</p><p>I always thought it was strange when these artists like Kurt Cobain or whoever would get really famous and say, &#39;I don&#39;t understand why this is happening to me.&#39; There is a mathematical formula to why you got famous. It isn&#39;t some magical thing that just started happening.</p><p>I think actors are divided into two groups: one that wants to be an actor to become famous and rich, and the other that wants to be an actor because they have to be. I&#39;m more in the second group.</p><p>I think there are a lot more writers who are actors than you know they just don&#39;t have roles on famous TV shows that you recognize.</p><p>I have also just finished three weeks on a soap opera in England. The soap opera is a rather famous one called Crossroads. It was first on television 25 years ago, and it has recently been brought back. I play the part of a businessman called David Wheeler.</p><p>I can deal with it now, but 13 is a tough age to be recognized and famous. It&#39;s a tough age, period.</p><p>These days there are a lot of people who just want to be famous. I think that comes from a naive place, because those people generally don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be comfortable with the idea of being famous.</p><p>Having bodyguards is just part of being famous, I think.</p><p>By virtue of some of the ways the game is played, in terms of message discipline, in terms of access for reporters, and especially in the way that sources and subjects, especially famous subjects, treat the media, almost by default there&#39;s more news that&#39;s falling into books.</p><p>I got out of autobiography because my story is, I was famous, it was hard for me, I got into therapy. I had trouble with food, I got a nutritionist. There&#39;s no story there.</p><p>Howard the Duck!&#39; That&#39;s a really interesting movie. I appreciate my career, because I&#39;ve had a lot of very interesting ups and downs, and most people... That movie is such a famous flop. In a land of a lot of flops, it&#39;s kind of awesome to be in a really famous flop. I mean, it&#39;s kind of a poster child for flops.;Lea Thompson;famous 21605;Going to New York to do whatever - show business - it just seemed fun.

So I wasn&#39;t scared.;January Jones;famous 21606;At each of these northern posts there were interesting experiences in store for me, as one who had read all the books of northern travel and dreamed for half a lifetime of the north and that was - almost daily meeting with famous men.;Ernest Thompson Seton;famous 21607;Right now I&#39;m the most famous silent movie actress in the world and I want to keep that for me.

It&#39;s a part of the business that grosses me out. I&#39;m always bummed out for people who just happen to be dating a celebrity, and they&#39;re also famous, and they can&#39;t live their life.;Andy Samberg;famous 21612;So I&#39;m a young boy in the 1940s growing up, seeing Ralph Bunche on a regular basis, seeing Duke Ellington on a regular basis. We know that these people are famous. They&#39;re living in the same community as we live in. They go to the same stores and shops.;Ed Smith;famous 21613;When I came to New York, I began to meet the people who became the most famous artists of our time. I was insecure about my own level of ability, I didn&#39;t know whether I could compete with these people and, at the same time. I was wondering what is this anyway?;Henry Flynt;famous 21614;People seldom become famous for what they say until after they are famous for what they&#39;ve done.;Cullen Hightower;famous 21615;And my marriage was perfect when I wasn&#39;t famous.;Damon Wayans;famous 21616;I never thought about being famous.;Damon Wayans;famous 21617;I&#39;m famous for being nicer to my fans than anyone on the face of the Earth because I figure a) They pay my salary, and b) It&#39;s probably like a big moment in your life to meet somebody so I would say, just come on up.;James Woods;famous 21618;I always regarded people who want fame with a lot of suspicion.

I was just a working actor who happened to be a kid. I was never really in a hit show until I was a teenager with West Wing playing First Daughter Zoey Bartlet. In a way, that was my saving grace - not being a star on a hit show. It kept me working and kept me grounded.</p><p>When you become famous, you start getting invites to parties where there are famous athletes and famous rock stars, politicians, people who have tremendous power and affluence. It&#39;s not in my DNA, but certainly I have been exposed to it.</p><p>I wanted to be a rich, famous rock-and-roll star in that order.</p><p>It&#39;s not a matter of becoming a superstar. Fame and money aren&#39;t the purpose of all this. No actor&#39;s going to say, &#39;I don&#39;t want to be famous.&#39; But the main purpose for doing what I&#39;m doing is the passion in the work.</p><p>I think success right now is not about how famous you are or how much you&#39;re getting paid, but it&#39;s more about if you&#39;re steadily working and you&#39;re happy with what you&#39;re doing.</p><p>I grew up being the girl who would always tune in to watch famous people talk about their careers, how they handled scandals and mega fame. I&#39;m trying to pick up tips.</p><p>The first syndicating I tried was when two partners and I created a production company in 1952. We wanted to syndicate famous Bible stories and sell them for $25 a show.</p><p>We had an interesting thing at that first dinner.

I was acting for quite a while before I got famous television made me famous. I guess that it&#39;s television that is responsible for everybody&#39;s desire to be famous.</p><p>I&#39;m really in no danger of being perceived as a famous movie actor!</p><p>My goal and my career is definitely not to be famous. That&#39;s a really horrible goal, just to be famous for the sake of having fame.</p><p>I&#39;m following my dreams and doing what I love as a designer. I did not want to be one of those kids with a famous last name that doesn&#39;t do anything.

But I do feel like I&#39;ve been able to connect with a lot of people.</p><p>I don&#39;t know about this thing - being famous. I haven&#39;t figured it out yet. It still mystifies me.</p><p>Few if any teenagers can relate to getting up for school and finding famous comics like Pryor and Williams hanging out in your living room after a hard night of partying. But that&#39;s Hollywood.</p><p>If it&#39;s not some daring, dangerous affair, it&#39;s just not interesting, or so it seems. So, here you have two people - a famous American iconic couple - who actually like each other sexually, in marriage. Imagine.</p><p>My office walls are covered with autographs of famous writers - it&#39;s what my children call my &#39;dead author wall.&#39; I have signatures from Mark Twain, Earnest Hemingway, Jack London, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Pearl Buck, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, to name a few.</p><p>King Crimson were the only really famous band I&#39;d been in.</p><p>When you&#39;re famous, you don&#39;t get to meet people because they want you to like them when the present themselves to you, and you don&#39;t see the real people.</p><p>Of course, Hollywood is still making some excellent pictures which reflect the great artistry that made Hollywood famous throughout the world, but these films are exceptions, judging from box office returns and press reviews.</p><p>Well, I think a lot of people just want to be famous.</p><p>Popstars really draws you in. It&#39;s fascinating. It&#39;s interesting to watch people thrown together in that kind of a situation. Even if the egos weren&#39;t involved and they weren&#39;t trying to be world famous. It&#39;s the Real World, only better.</p><p>I want to be so famous that drag queens will dress like me in parades when I&#39;m dead.</p><p>It&#39;s funny to be discovered by a lot of people who didn&#39;t know you before. People always used to say, &#39;Do you shop at Home Depot?&#39; or &#39;Does your kid go to such and such school?&#39; They want to know why they know me, even if they don&#39;t know my name. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing, by the way I think it&#39;s nice to be kind of anonymously famous.</p><p>I was brought up with psychics and tarot cards. My mum was always told I was going to be in a boy band and be famous as a singer.</p><p>When you reach a certain status in Hollywood, you have to play a lot of games to stay in the limelight. It becomes more about being famous than being an actor.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t a kid who moved out from Iowa with aspirations of becoming a famous star - I was intrigued by the idea of filmmaking and by the idea of what it would be like to play a character in a movie.</p><p>I love meeting famous people. I&#39;m even happy just looking at them.</p><p>It&#39;s every teenager&#39;s dream to be in a band, tour the world and be famous.</p><p>What Whitney Houston has accomplished will never be accomplished. She&#39;s the most famous person on the planet as far as vocaling and her songs. So I&#39;m very happy that I can sit here and say I had a chance to know her. And I&#39;m still dazed that she&#39;s gone. But she lives because her music is so powerful.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t not being famous any more, or even not being a recording artist. It was having nobody who needed me, no phones ringing, nothing to do. Because I&#39;m still too young to do nothing. I was only 24 when all that happened. Now, at 40, I feel I&#39;ve got more to give than I ever have.</p><p>When I was in fourth grade... this wonderful teacher said you didn&#39;t have to write a book report, you could just talk about the book, you could do a drawing of the book, you could write a play inspired by the book, and that&#39;s what I did. I got to be so famous. I had to go around to every school and perform it. It was just so natural and fun.</p><p>Becoming famous and selling a lot of records doesn&#39;t change a thing.</p><p>I&#39;m famous. That&#39;s my job.</p><p>Fame is something I think happens as a result of trying to do good work. If you&#39;re trying to be famous, your work usually suffers.</p><p>I haven&#39;t paid for anything since I became famous.</p><p>Once you start telling people you&#39;re famous, they believe you.</p><p>The one thing you&#39;ve got to say about Columbia is that it has courses that are famous. It has alumni who come back and say it was the best thing they ever did.</p><p>They were all famous and fantastic fellows.</p><p>I love being famous. It validates that I have something to say.</p><p>I don&#39;t really see myself as famous.</p><p>When I wasn&#39;t famous, I had a lot of friends, almost all of them Italian.

You men are spoiled.</p><p>In France, we don&#39;t yet have the craft that American TV does or big studios like Paramount. It was so cool going through those famous gates when you have your own little pass and picture on it. Woo hoo, I&#39;m going to work!</p><p>I guess some people want to be performers because they want to be famous.</p><p>People are famous for being famous and for nothing else.

I have this vision of myself living in a skip and eating cat food. It&#39;s because I&#39;m freelance, and I&#39;ve never had a proper job. I don&#39;t have a pension, and my savings are dwindling. I always thought someone would just come along and look after me.</p><p>Let children read whatever they want and then talk about it with them.

A lot of the honesty of it, the bitter honesty, is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary.

No leader can claim: &#39;this is not happening in my backyard.&#39;</p><p>Most fears are basic: fear of the dark, fear of going down in the basement, fear of weird sounds, fear that somebody is waiting for you in your closet. Those kinds of things stay with you no matter what age.</p><p>Truth Will Set U Free&#39; is about honesty.

My fans send letters saying they have taken up jogging because I do it.</p><p>I&#39;m doing four hours of gymnastics training a day, six days a week and then an extra two to three hours in a fitness center as well.</p><p>We talk a lot on &#39;Biggest Loser&#39; about how fitness is a natural antidepressant, how it burns off stress. What I like about running is that it gives me time alone. I&#39;m always busy, with people at work, with my kids. I love getting out for a run by myself and just listening to my music.</p><p>Fitness is a luxury when you are busy!</p><p>I can jog, but I can&#39;t run. That&#39;s hard for me. I like the fact that I can jog for fitness, but to me there&#39;s a huge difference between jogging and running.</p><p>Teaching kids about health and fitness is important to me. It&#39;s about being fit for life.</p><p>A life coach does for the rest of your life what a personal trainer does for your health and fitness.</p><p>Our children are obese, either have or being threatened by diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and not socially adjusting properly to others because of a lack of fitness.</p><p>Oh, and once, when I was in the Marines, I got a perfect score on my physical fitness test.</p><p>Fitness is not an option. It&#39;s part of my job.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong with extreme dieting and hard-core fitness plans is that they don&#39;t take into account the rest of your life.</p><p>I recommend that people try new stuff or take new fitness classes all the time. It&#39;s important to mix up your routine, not only for your body, but also for your mental state.</p><p>The public character of every public servant is legitimate subject of discussion, and his fitness or unfitness for office may be fairly canvassed by any person.</p><p>Resting for me is fitness training.</p><p>I&#39;m not in the best shape, but I want to prove to myself I can do something that seems insurmountable and inspire others by showing them no matter where they are in their fitness goals, they can do it, too.</p><p>In the British Special Air Service, combat fitness is all about running.</p><p>I thought I did well for someone who has been out for 10 or 11 months. Then I was sub against Liverpool and tried to play for the guys and work on my fitness.</p><p>My fitness trainer&#39;s English, my physio&#39;s English, some of my friends are English. I don&#39;t have a problem with English people at all.</p><p>I can&#39;t eat whatever I want, definitely not. I&#39;m always controlled because I do a lot of fitness and triathlons, not just Formula One, so I always make sure I eat the right things.</p><p>For me, triathlons were something that was down to me and my fitness. Now, I really enjoy the pain in the triathlon of chasing someone down. It&#39;s a bit like chasing down Nico Rosberg in the last few laps at Silverstone - it makes you feel alive.</p><p>With fitness, I do Bikrams hot yoga. The gym that I have in my building is amazing. I love to do cardio and weights there.</p><p>They both go together you can&#39;t be in front of the camera hosting a fitness television show in front of 75 million households and not have trained 6 days per week year round - in a bikini no less.</p><p>I&#39;m 33 now and I seem to have hit a fitness plane. Shifting the wobbly bits isn&#39;t as easy as it used to be.</p><p>Fitness is a curve. You can be Lance Armstrong, or you can be really out of shape at the opposite end. People enter the curve wherever they are and then they can move up the curve, by better nutrition and better exercise.</p><p>I try and maintain a little bit of fitness, man.</p><p>As the proud father of two teens and past Chairman to the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, I am committed to educating parents and especially young people on ways to live a long, healthy and active life.</p><p>I believe it&#39;s extremely important to include some other type of fitness activity in your training, so cross training will help you to avoid injury when you are dancing.</p><p>I personally love to run outdoor fitness trails. I love the meditative value I get when out alone, challenging myself to run faster and higher.</p><p>I like starting off the new year fresh. I&#39;m excited to see how 2013 turns out. Maybe because I&#39;m an actress and I am always on a diet and fitness program, but my New Year&#39;s resolution is to let myself be nice to myself about my body.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to lose my fitness. I&#39;m 45. I have two babies. I&#39;ve got a long way to go and I want to keep in tiptop shape. There&#39;s no magic bullet.</p><p>The spirit of the Olympic movement is great for young people because it teaches them about the training and discipline required to compete. Even if they don&#39;t make the teams, they can rededicate their lives to the art of sport, discipline, and physical fitness.</p><p>A drunkard in the gutter is just where he ought to be, according to the fitness and tendency of things. Nature has set upon him the process of decline and dissolution by which she removes things which have survived their usefulness.</p><p>With both kids, I started working out again at 16 days postpartum, but I treated myself with kindness, doing mild workouts, because my fitness level was lower.</p><p>The goodness of a thing created is the perfection of its fitness for the use which it serves. Now that use is either particular or universal.</p><p>People may say I developed an iron will, but what really happened is that I made myself much fitter. I think an iron will is always supported by fitness.</p><p>I&#39;m enjoying myself this year and for once I&#39;m not chasing my fitness.</p><p>Overall, I think I&#39;m in pretty good shape, but I&#39;m not really someone that is gung-ho or a fitness fanatic.</p><p>I&#39;ve always believed fitness is an entry point to help you build that happier, healthier life. When your health is strong, you&#39;re capable of taking risks. You&#39;ll feel more confident to ask for the promotion. You&#39;ll have more energy to be a better mom. You&#39;ll feel more deserving of love.</p><p>My mother was a P.E. teacher, and she was kind of a fanatic about fitness and nutrition growing up, so it was ingrained in me at a young age. As I get older, I&#39;m finding out it&#39;s not about getting all buffed up and looking good. It&#39;s more about staying healthy and flexible.</p><p>I have long recognized a link between fitness and mental health and I think we need to encourage young people to take part in sports and team activities because we know it has such positive results.</p><p>My experience as a school nurse taught me that we need to make a concerted effort, all of us, to increase physical fitness activity among our children and to encourage all Americans to adopt a healthier diet that includes fruits and vegetables, but there is more.</p><p>I feel if I&#39;m healthy and happy, I look good. With a good mixture of fitness and healthy food I always feel great!</p><p>The main thing is that it&#39;s nice to see these young people - 9 to 14 years old - take the opportunity to get more involved in their health and fitness. We need more kids to be more active.</p><p>I have run two Olympic &#39;A&#39; standard times over the past 12 months and with the time I ran at the African Championships last week I know my speed and fitness are constantly improving so that I will peak in time for the Olympics.</p><p>My fitness is good. I hope to improve it even further during training.</p><p>I have been particularly struck with the overwhelming evidence which is given as to the fitness of the natives of India for high offices and employments.</p><p>The health industry, the fitness industry, was really starting to pick up. This was around the mid 80&#39;s.</p><p>I do a one-hour workout called Drenched, a cardio-boxing fitness routine, Monday through Friday. There are usually between twenty-five and fifty people there - everyone from stay-at-home moms and professional martial artists to teenagers and seniors. They play great dance music. When I can, I take two classes back-to-back.</p><p>Flexibility is crucial to my fitness. Incorporating a good warm-up and cool-down into every session decreases my chances of injury. I use both dynamic and static stretching in my training. I&#39;ve starting doing a few yoga sessions which incorporates muscle strength and flexibility.</p><p>The value and utility of any experiment are determined by the fitness of the material to the purpose for which it is used, and thus in the case before us it cannot be immaterial what plants are subjected to experiment and in what manner such experiment is conducted.</p><p>My priority is to turn people - especially kids - on to sports and being active so they don&#39;t even have to think about it being good for their health. If people participate for the fun of it, and believe me - it is fun, then fitness programs will be much more successful.</p><p>I think a basic level of fitness can help the body cope with all manner of incidents.</p><p>I have found a flat on Merseyside and am settling down here. If I can keep playing and get back to full match fitness, I know I have a lot to offer still.</p><p>Now I say that if you run more than 15 miles a week, it&#39;s for something other than aerobic fitness. Once you pass 15 miles, you do not see much further improvement.</p><p>We are involved in youth testing internationally. We want to try to prove without a shadow of a doubt the relationship between physical fitness and health, not just physical fitness and ability to perform.</p><p>I&#39;ve had one very bad ankle injury but otherwise I&#39;ve been incredibly lucky with my fitness. I&#39;ve worked hard at it and I&#39;ve always been fit even compared to other players. That sustains you through various parts of your career, but I am 36.</p><p>I&#39;m healthy now. I probably wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m at my best fitness level and I haven&#39;t played that much lately, but I&#39;m healthy and that&#39;s all that matters.</p><p>For years, I always thought it was hilarious that I was this fitness guru, because fitness was just a tool I utilized to help people improve their confidence. For me, it&#39;s never been about fitness. It&#39;s always been about helping to empower people.</p><p>I&#39;ve published one book before, and now I&#39;m writing a book of essays and stories about life in Tokyo. And I have one book coming out in May in Germany, about fitness.</p><p>Guided only by their feeling for symmetry, simplicity, and generality, and an indefinable sense of the fitness of things, creative mathematicians now, as in the past, are inspired by the art of mathematics rather than by any prospect of ultimate usefulness.</p><p>For a good workout, I go to At One Fitness in North Hollywood, where my trainer, Jon Allsop, puts me through it all. I like it because it&#39;s a small gym and I&#39;ve known the people for a long time. Jon will have me do cross-training where I&#39;ll lift weights, jump rope, throw around a medicine ball and I never get to stop.</p><p>There are similarities between business and sport, in the pressures involved and in the fitness aspect too.</p><p>Fitness will be a major factor in the first race and I think that will play into the hands of drivers who have been racing recently, rather than people like me who haven&#39;t raced properly for a decade. I&#39;am not one of the favourites to start with.</p><p>I have always maintained a high level of fitness&quot;</p><p>I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.</p><p>Just as the soul fills the body, so God fills the world. Just as the soul bears the body, so God endures the world. Just as the soul sees but is not seen, so God sees but is not seen. Just as the soul feeds the body, so God gives food to the world.</p><p>We can&#39;t get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can&#39;t just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.</p><p>There is no way that writers can be tamed and rendered civilized or even cured. The only solution known to science is to provide the patient with an isolation room, where he can endure the acute stages in private and where food can be poked in to him with a stick.</p><p>Your words are my food, your breath my wine. You are everything to me.</p><p>Reminds me of my safari in Africa. Somebody forgot the corkscrew and for several days we had to live on nothing but food and water.</p><p>Food is an important part of a balanced diet.</p><p>Put your nose into the Bible everyday. It is your spiritual food. And then share it. Make a vow not to be a lukewarm Christian.</p><p>I know a man who gave up smoking, drinking, sex, and rich food. He was healthy right up to the day he killed himself.</p><p>Innovations that are guided by smallholder farmers, adapted to local circumstances, and sustainable for the economy and environment will be necessary to ensure food security in the future.</p><p>We should all grow our own food and do our own waste processing, we really should.</p><p>If you&#39;re using first-class land for biofuels, then you&#39;re competing with the growing of food. And so you&#39;re actually spiking food prices by moving energy production into agriculture.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to impress me. I don&#39;t need a fancy party to be happy. Just good friends, good food, and good laughs. I&#39;m happy. I&#39;m satisfied. I&#39;m content.</p><p>The main facts in human life are five: birth, food, sleep, love and death.</p><p>I have a total irreverence for anything connected with society except that which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer.</p><p>No man will be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself into a jail for being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned... a man in a jail has more room, better food, and commonly better company.</p><p>Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.</p><p>To say that a work of art is good, but incomprehensible to the majority of men, is the same as saying of some kind of food that it is very good but that most people can&#39;t eat it.</p><p>Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are God. Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realize that, if you provide them with food and water and affection, they draw the conclusion that they are God.</p><p>I take care of my flowers and my cats. And enjoy food. And that&#39;s living.</p><p>I tell my students, it&#39;s not difficult to identify with somebody like yourself, somebody next door who looks like you. What&#39;s more difficult is to identify with someone you don&#39;t see, who&#39;s very far away, who&#39;s a different color, who eats a different kind of food. When you begin to do that then literature is really performing its wonders.</p><p>Facts are to the mind what food is to the body.</p><p>A city is a place where there is no need to wait for next week to get the answer to a question, to taste the food of any country, to find new voices to listen to and familiar ones to listen to again.</p><p>Men do not have to cook their food they do so for symbolic reasons to show they are men and not beasts.</p><p>When I get a little money I buy books and if any is left I buy food and clothes.</p><p>The first duty of government is to see that people have food, fuel, and clothes. The second, that they have means of moral and intellectual education.</p><p>Money is kind of a base subject. Like water, food, air and housing, it affects everything yet for some reason the world of academics thinks it&#39;s a subject below their social standing.</p><p>The food here is terrible, and the portions are too small.</p><p>It is the food which you furnish to your mind that determines the whole character of your life.</p><p>Fame is a fickle food upon a shifting plate.</p><p>The class of citizens who provide at once their own food and their own raiment, may be viewed as the most truly independent and happy.</p><p>Animals that we eat are raised for food in the most economical way possible, and the serious food producers do it in the most humane way possible. I think anyone who is a carnivore needs to understand that meat does not originally come in these neat little packages.</p><p>Music is the fourth great material want, first food, then clothes, then shelter, then music.</p><p>We can no more do without spirituality than we can do without food, shelter, or clothing.</p><p>I do the same exercises I did 50 years ago and they still work. I eat the same food I ate 50 years ago and it still works.</p><p>I&#39;d like to be rich. I&#39;d like a lot of money to put into my physicals and to buy food for all my friends.</p><p>The best way to lose weight is to close your mouth - something very difficult for a politician. Or watch your food - just watch it, don&#39;t eat it.</p><p>Any healthy man can go without food for two days - but not without poetry.</p><p>People love their animals so much so that they put little clothes on them and necklaces and booties and things like that. And if you love your animal, then you should feed them something that&#39;s not dangerous for them. There&#39;s a lot of poisonous stuff that they&#39;re putting in a lot of that food, those by-products.</p><p>If we do not permit the earth to produce beauty and joy, it will in the end not produce food, either.</p><p>On the Continent people have good food in England people have good table manners.</p><p>Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.</p><p>Mankind: A quality of life upgrade is available to each and every one of you. It should give you a quality of life upgrade, which means no drugs, no alcohol, no fast food - unless, of course, it&#39;s a mallard.</p><p>If I like a food, I&#39;ll eat it, even if I know it&#39;s not good for me.</p><p>Poor, darling fellow - he died of food. He was killed by the dinner table.</p><p>Amazing that the human race has taken enough time out from thinking about food or sex to create the arts and sciences.</p><p>Wit is the salt of conversation, not the food.</p><p>You define a good flight by negatives: you didn&#39;t get hijacked, you didn&#39;t crash, you didn&#39;t throw up, you weren&#39;t late, you weren&#39;t nauseated by the food. So you are grateful.</p><p>I do remember how it was to be poor. I do remember that in my early years, we had to grow and raise all of our food, even our animals. And I remember in my early life, we didn&#39;t even have electricity. So it was very, very hard times then.</p><p>I say grace. I&#39;m a big believer in grace. I happen to believe in a God that made all the food and so I&#39;m pretty grateful for that and I thank him for that. But I&#39;m also thankful for the people that put the food on the table.</p><p>What is food to one man is bitter poison to others.</p><p>Baking cookies is comforting, and cookies are the sweetest little bit of comfort food. They are very bite-sized and personal.</p><p>We are not hungry... Why foist this food upon us? We don&#39;t want to be choked. We have enough.</p><p>The worst food you&#39;ll ever eat will probably be prepared by a &#39;cook&#39; who calls himself a &#39;chef.&#39; Mark my words.</p><p>If you reject the food, ignore the customs, fear the religion and avoid the people, you might better stay at home.</p><p>Is it a coincidence that in 1998, Barack Obama talks about a majority coalition of welfare recipients and in 2012 we got a record number of Americans on food stamps while he&#39;s president? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence.</p><p>I have always said there is only one thing that can bring our nation down - our dependence on foreign countries for food and energy. Agriculture is the backbone of our economy.</p><p>I was always a junk food person, still am.</p><p>I&#39;ve always liked Atlanta. And not just for the strip clubs, but the shopping and the food.</p><p>Christmas is more stressful with present buying and making sure everyone gets included, but Thanksgiving is really not that. I don&#39;t ever really get stressed out about the food.</p><p>I know it&#39;s not cat food, but what exactly is it that they put inside of tinned ravioli?</p><p>The problem is when that fun stuff becomes the habit. And I think that&#39;s what&#39;s happened in our culture. Fast food has become the everyday meal.</p><p>President Obama is the most successful food stamp president in American history. I would like to be the most successful paycheck president in American history.</p><p>If we gave up eating beef we would have roughly 20 to 30 times more land for food than we have now.</p><p>For the Nugent family, fast food is a running herbivore.</p><p>Let me be the first to tell you, drinking alcohol is the worst thing to do in cold weather. Hot soup is the best because the process of digesting food helps to warm you up.</p><p>The passion of the Italian or the Italian-American population is endless for food and lore and everything about it.</p><p>I&#39;m working harder than ever now, and I&#39;m putting on my pants the same as I always have. I just get up every day and try to do a little better than the day before, and that is to run a great restaurant with great food, great wine, and great service. That&#39;s my philosophy.</p><p>I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker, put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table. But she taught me as I walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start, but where you&#39;re going. That&#39;s family values.</p><p>God gives every bird its food, but He does not throw it into its nest.</p><p>The secret of food lies in memory - of thinking and then knowing what the taste of cinnamon or steak is.</p><p>I&#39;ve often said that the most important thing you can give your children is wings. Because, you&#39;re not gonna always be able to bring food to the nest. You&#39;re... sometimes... they&#39;re gonna have to be able to fly by themselves.</p><p>What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.</p><p>My three addictions of choice are food, love and work.</p><p>If I don&#39;t get food in my mouth, I&#39;m still happy. If my pants are round my ankles, as long as I don&#39;t get arrested for indecent exposure, I&#39;m happy. I&#39;m worried about keeping my hair, not how it&#39;s combed.</p><p>In a drama of the highest order there is little food for censure or hatred it teaches rather self-knowledge and self-respect.</p><p>Obscenity, which is ever blasphemy against the divine beauty in life, is a monster for which the corruption of society forever brings forth new food, which it devours in secret.</p><p>I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.</p><p>So, what&#39;s it like in the real world? Well, the food is better, but beyond that, I don&#39;t recommend it.</p><p>Health food makes me sick.</p><p>I remember once I read a book on mental illness and there was a nurse that had gotten sick. Do you know what she died from? From worrying about the mental patients not being able to get their food. She became a mental patient.</p><p>Revenge is barren of itself: it is the dreadful food it feeds on its delight is murder, and its end is despair.</p><p>I offer neither pay, nor quarters, nor food I offer only hunger, thirst, forced marches, battles and death. Let him who loves his country with his heart, and not merely with his lips, follow me.</p><p>I love dogs. They live in the moment and don&#39;t care about anything except affection and food. They&#39;re loyal and happy. Humans are just too damn complicated.</p><p>If I agree to dispose of any part of our land to the white people I would feel guilty of taking food away from our children&#39;s mouths, and I do not wish to be that mean.</p><p>Food tells you everything about the way people live and who they are.</p><p>I first got involved with ending world hunger, and I got hip to the facts about it - what a huge problem it was and how it wasn&#39;t a matter of not having food or not knowing how to end it, but it was a matter of creating the political will.</p><p>I love inventive food, but I want the classic dishes to taste like how I remember them. I get a little bummed out when there is too much fancy stuff going on and it doesn&#39;t resemble the original dish at all.</p><p>It&#39;s not difficult for me to stay healthy. I like healthy food.</p><p>My inspiration was my mom. She&#39;s a great cook, and she still cooks, and we still banter back and forth about cooking. Growing up in a mostly Portuguese community, food was important and the family table was extremely important. At a very young age I understood that.</p><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be a day when I don&#39;t think about food or my body, but I&#39;m living with it, and I wish I could tell young girls to find their safe place and stay with it.</p><p>The fact that food plays such an important part in my films has everything to do with my family.</p><p>If your mother cooks Italian food, why should you go to a restaurant?</p><p>We take food for granted, but it isn&#39;t a luxury for many people.</p><p>If I&#39;m a lush at anything, it&#39;s food and drink. I&#39;m not materialistic in any way, but I value food.</p><p>My gosh, I love food. If I wasn&#39;t an actor, I could be a completely different body shape right now.</p><p>To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn&#39;t raise me to just go out and buy this or that car. The only reason I wanted to make money as an actor was because I&#39;m passionate about food!</p><p>I love food, all types of food. I love Korean food, Japanese, Italian, French. In Australia, we don&#39;t have a distinctive Australian food, so we have food from everywhere all around the world. We&#39;re very multicultural, so we grew up with lots of different types of food.</p><p>Well, I have a lot of food references in my work.</p><p>Quarreling over food and drink, having neither scruples nor shame, not knowing right from wrong, not trying to avoid death or injury, not fearful of greater strength or of greater numbers, greedily aware only of food and drink - such is the bravery of the dog and boar.</p><p>Ever since Eve started it all by offering Adam the apple, woman&#39;s punishment has been to supply a man with food then suffer the consequences when it disagrees with him.</p><p>We must pay greater attention to keeping our bodies and minds healthy and able to heal. Yet we are making it difficult for our defences to work. We allow things to be sold that should not be called food. Many have no nutritive value and lead to obesity, salt imbalance, and allergies.</p><p>When I go on Japanese Airlines, I really love it because I like Japanese food.</p><p>I&#39;ve been all over the world. I love New York, I love Paris, San Francisco, so many places. But there&#39;s no place like New Orleans. It&#39;s got the best food. It&#39;s got the best music. It&#39;s got the best people. It&#39;s got the most fun stuff to do.</p><p>I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family it says they&#39;re looting, if you see a white family it says they&#39;re looking for food.</p><p>When I got to France I realized I didn&#39;t know very much about food at all. I&#39;d never had a real cake. I&#39;d had those cakes from cake mixes or the ones that have a lot of baking powder in them. A really good French cake doesn&#39;t have anything like that in it - it&#39;s all egg power.</p><p>And if you look at the reality in the United States, where you have more than 40 million people below the poverty line and 42 million on food stamps, and then you look at poverty around the world, clearly the way we&#39;re running the engine of capitalism is not serving us well.</p><p>The lunch in a normal American restaurant is very problematic for me. I don&#39;t like to have hot food for lunch.</p><p>I was eating bad stuff. Lots of sugar and carbs, junk food all the time. It makes you very irritated.</p><p>Well, we lost a lot of our independence already. We are dependent on China for credit. We are dependent on Middle Eastern countries for energy supplies. And many Americans are dependent on the government for their income, health care, education of their children, food stamps.</p><p>The vast amount of waste and sheer stupidity in government - from the Pentagon to the Food and Drug Administration - could fill committee agendas for years.</p><p>I do not knowingly kill any living thing - including insects or rodents - and I thank my food for sustaining me.</p><p>I think one of the terrible things today is that people have this deathly fear of food: fear of eggs, say, or fear of butter. Most doctors feel that you can have a little bit of everything.</p><p>I need my food to keep my energy up, so I can&#39;t really diet.</p><p>If you don&#39;t want women to do whatever they need to do then you must provide them with food, you must provide them with shelter and their basic human rights.</p><p>When two kids are being completely berserk, and they&#39;re naked and throwing food around, sometimes I just let it go because I can see a future where they&#39;re going to be dressed, and they&#39;re going to be at school. So I kind of let stuff go sometimes.</p><p>Cats are very independent animals. They&#39;re very sexy, if you want. Dogs are different. They&#39;re familiar. They&#39;re obedient. You call a cat, you go, &#39;Cat, come here.&#39; He doesn&#39;t come to you unless you have something in your hand that he thinks might be food. They&#39;re very free animals, and I like that.</p><p>Cats have a scam going - you buy the food, they eat the food, they go away that&#39;s the deal.</p><p>I&#39;ve been to therapists my whole life. I find the less attention I pay to food, the healthier I am. Any obsession is dangerous. And a whole country that&#39;s obsessed with one thing, unless it&#39;s, like, jeans, it&#39;s very dangerous. Everyone&#39;s obsessed right now with carbohydrates in this country. It&#39;s ridiculous.</p><p>Make food a very incidental part of your life by filling your life so full of meaningful things that you&#39;ll hardly have time to think about food.</p><p>My grandfather&#39;s family used to own a pasta factory in Naples and they would go door-to-door selling their pasta.

But what happened there, what actually happens to the food is all science.</p><p>If I can wake up everyday before I die and know that I don&#39;t have to serve anyone food or drinks, I will be happy!</p><p>I am thankful I was born in America, although if I gain any more weight the burqa thing may start to seem like a good idea to me.

I never liked being that skinny.</p><p>I&#39;m too lazy and I like food and I like my free time too much to spend it working out!</p><p>Quantity in food is more to be regarded than quality.

But it also requires that everyone should contribute to the production of food.</p><p>My contribution I hope is to get people to eat full-flavored food.

Reason plays some role in our decisions about food, but it&#39;s rarely driving the car.</p><p>I first became a vegetarian when I was nine, in response to an argument made by a radical babysitter.

We&#39;ve seen a 41 percent increase in food stamp recipients across the United States of America since President Obama was sworn in in January 2009.

It&#39;s very different from the food that the astronauts ate in the very early days of the space program.</p><p>Listen - of course money changes everything, but so does sunlight, and so does food: These are powerful but neutral energy sources, neither inherently good nor evil but shaped only by the way we use them.</p><p>I guess I feel that I was following my instincts, and at the same time being guided by the best. I became totally intrigued with Louisiana - the people, the food. It is a part of my life. Everything that has happened for me since moving here has just been icing on the cake.</p><p>Music is one of those things that is constantly going in my head all the time. It&#39;s sort of like the evolution and creation of doing food, or my philosophy about wine. It&#39;s always beating in my head, so it keeps the spirit moving.</p><p>I came here because the city has a tradition and is a very respected food city.</p><p>I&#39;ve always done food that can work in a set time frame.

At least we give you food, know what I mean?</p><p>You know, for 300 years it&#39;s been kind of the same. There are restaurants in New Orleans that the menu hasn&#39;t changed in 125 years, so how is one going to change or evolve the food?</p><p>My Food Network shows, &#39;Emeril Live&#39; and &#39;Essence of Emeril,&#39; are not in production right now, but I wouldn&#39;t say that I&#39;m necessarily leaving Food Network. I have a lot of television still in me. I enjoy teaching people, so it&#39;s just a matter of time before I do something new.</p><p>Being a food show and being me, I always kicked it up a notch, which means I would always elevate the spice level or the complexity of a particular dish. So, it was always like we&#39;re going to kick this up a little bit.</p><p>My food is Louisiana, New Orleans-based, well-seasoned, rustic. I think it&#39;s pretty unique because of my background being influenced by my mom, Portuguese and French Canadian. There&#39;s a lot going on there.</p><p>Though I love the luxury of the Waldorf Towers, room service there doesn&#39;t do soul food.</p><p>Freedom must be gained step by step, slowly. Freedom is a food which must be carefully administered when people are too hungry for it.</p><p>We created a line of pet food called Nutrish that&#39;s made to human standards, and 100 percent of the proceeds go to animal rescue.

I&#39;m just really into cooking and passionate about it.</p><p>Australia is so cool that it&#39;s hard to even know where to start describing it. The beaches are beautiful so is the weather. Not too crowded. Great food, great music, really nice people. It must be a lot like Los Angeles was many years ago.</p><p>I think people are smart enough to sort it out. They know when they&#39;re watching one of these food fight shows where journalists sit around and yell and scream at each other, versus serious issue reporting.</p><p>Working at the Food Bank with my kids is an eye-opener. The face of hunger isn&#39;t the bum on the street drinking Sterno it&#39;s the working poor. They don&#39;t look any different, they don&#39;t behave any differently, they&#39;re not really any less educated. They are incredibly less privileged, and that&#39;s it.</p><p>To be interested in food but not in food production is clearly absurd.</p><p>There&#39;s not one food that causes diabetes.What causes Type II diabetes is being overweight...

That hole was made for pies.</p><p>I wake up every morning happy for where I am in life. It&#39;s not all about the cooking, but the fact that I can contribute by using my influence to help people all over the country. In the last two years, my partners and I have fed more than 10 million hungry people by bringing meat to food banks.</p><p>I will never use a substitute for butter. Margarine is one molecule away from eating plastic. If I&#39;m going to eat that type of food, it&#39;s going to be the real deal.</p><p>I thought, you know the food and the diet thing is one way to start yourself onto a healthy lifestyle, but if you don&#39;t move, if you don&#39;t start exercising you&#39;re gonna deteriorate.</p><p>Habaneros have a great fruity flavor, but the challenge is that you have to deflect the heat in order to taste the flavor. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;re dead. They should really have a warning sign on them. Deflect the habanero&#39;s heat by pairing it with sweet food.</p><p>I like food, like any other guy, but it is not the main thing in my life. I can do without it.</p><p>There are realities we all share, regardless of our nationality, language, or individual tastes. As we need food, so do we need emotional nourishment: love, kindness, appreciation, and support from others.</p><p>Food prices are often kept artificially high. The result is that the Millennium Development Goals set out by the United Nations at the start of the new millennium are not being reached. Fine words have not yet been turned into deeds.</p><p>Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, is the holy of holies of Jewish time. It is that rarest of phenomena, a Jewish festival without food. Instead it is a day of fasting and prayer, introspection and self-judgment when, collectively and repeatedly, we confess our sins and pray to be written into God&#39;s Book of Life.</p><p>I&#39;m into mellow dates with really good food.</p><p>I like to know exactly what&#39;s being put into my food.</p><p>There&#39;s so much importance in honoring your everyday hero. It doesn&#39;t take money. It doesn&#39;t take connections. What matters is that people get involved. Whether your passion is gun control or food or whatever it may be, everybody needs to stop being so self-absorbed.</p><p>My goal is to make Italian food clean and accessible and beautiful and tasty, with simple ingredients that people can find at a local grocery store, because people don&#39;t want to go to a gourmet shop in search of items that will sit in their pantry for years after they use just a teaspoon or pinch of them.</p><p>I think you can tell the food is close to my heart, too, because I&#39;m doing what I do best.</p><p>Food was always a big part of my life. My grandfather was one of 14 kids, and his parents had a pasta factory, so as a kid, he and his siblings would sell pasta door to door. After he became a movie producer, he opened up De Laurentiis Food Stores - one in Los Angeles and one in New York.</p><p>Attitudes toward food have completely changed.</p><p>My grandfather gave me inspiration to cook, and love food and flavors. My Aunt Raffie, gave me creativity and the inspiration to create new things. My mother inspires me to find simplicity in food.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing like a home-cooked meal - nothing! When people ask me what the best restaurant in L.A. is, I say, &#39;Uh, my house.&#39; It&#39;s more intimate. Food can connect people in a forever sort of way.</p><p>I&#39;m into very colorful food. Obviously lots of flavor, but I think we eat with our eyes first, so it has to look great. The presentation has to be great.</p><p>In Kenya women are the first victims of environmental degradation, because they are the ones who walk for hours looking for water, who fetch firewood, who provide food for their families.</p><p>Food is a coping mechanism people are afraid of giving it up because then they&#39;ll feel confused and lost.</p><p>I love South American food, and I haven&#39;t really been down there. I really need a vacation.</p><p>The lack of access to proper nutrition is not only fueling obesity, it is leading to food insecurity and hunger among our children.</p><p>I can spend hours in a grocery store. I get so excited when I see food, I go crazy. I spend hours arranging my baskets so that everything fits in and nothing gets squashed. I&#39;m really anal about it, actually.</p><p>My mom was on welfare and the occasional food stamp, but I have never participated in any of those governmental programs, even the ones that kind of work like education, scholarships and whatever, and I managed to do just fine.</p><p>I cook a little bit. I make a Hungarian dish called chicken paprikash that&#39;s out of this world. I&#39;ll give a heads-up to all of your readers that it doesn&#39;t have to be between Thai and Mexican every night. Toss some Hungarian in every once in a while. You will not be sorry. Good, solid peasant food.</p><p>People see you onstage and the glamorous side, but they don&#39;t see you traveling 600 miles a night, eating truck stop food and spending by yourself staring at walls.</p><p>I hid myself in food.</p><p>But I don&#39;t begrudge anybody, because I know how hard it is to have that dream and to make it happen, whether or not it&#39;s just to put a roof over your head and food on the table.</p><p>I always made my food congenial to my constitution, and my health was always excellent.</p><p>I learned very early that our health is always impaired by some excess either of food or abstinence, and I never had any physician except myself.</p><p>Never be a food snob.

That&#39;s not a criticism they&#39;re passionate about cutting hair or cooking food, and that&#39;s why they got in the business, not because they have an MBA.</p><p>I think one thing that kids who grow up on farms really have going for them is they have exposure to death and birth in a totally different way. I think it takes away a little bit of the mystery and a little bit of the fear, and I do wish I had that. And I wish I was able to grow my own food.</p><p>Becoming food savvy is one thing, but it&#39;s amazing how fast savvy turns to snooty, and snooty leaves you preparing three-hour meals that break your budget and that the kids won&#39;t even eat.</p><p>As the earth spins through space, a view from above the North Pole would encompass most of the wealth of the world - most of its food, productive machines, doctors, engineers and teachers.

I thought at the time that diabetes went along with bad habits, but I was the last one in my family to eat junk food.</p><p>Food has always brought me comfort and the bingeing is triggered when I&#39;m in a space that is not positive.</p><p>I kept thinking, &#39;Somebody has to make a food show that is actually educational and entertaining at the same time... a show that got down to the &#39;why things happen.&#39; Plus, I hated my job - I didn&#39;t think it was very worthwhile.</p><p>You don&#39;t want flame to hit your food. Flame is bad. Flame does nasty things to food. It makes soot and it makes deposits of various chemicals that are not too good for us. The last thing you really want to see licking at your food while it&#39;s on a grill is an actual flame.</p><p>I spent a college semester in a small town in Italy - and that is where I truly tasted food for the first time.</p><p>You know most of the food that Americans hold so dear - things like hamburgers and hot dogs - were road food, but even before they were road food, they were peasant food.</p><p>I think a lot of food shows, especially when we started &#39;Good Eats&#39; back in the late &#39;90s, they were still really about food. &#39;Good Eats&#39; isn&#39;t about food, it&#39;s about entertainment. If, however, we can virally infect you with knowledge or interest, then all the better.</p><p>I&#39;m a filmmaker who decided to go to culinary school. All I picked up was the fact if I didn&#39;t understand what was going on with every single ingredient, I could be qualifying for, like, the lunch food job at my daughter&#39;s school.</p><p>I am a filmmaker. That is all I&#39;ve ever been. You know, Martin Scorsese makes films about the mob. And I make movies about food.</p><p>Do not allow watching food to replace making food.</p><p>Keep it simple in the kitchen. If you use quality ingredients, you don&#39;t need anything fancy to make food delicious: just a knife, a cutting board, and some good nonstick cookware, and you&#39;re set.</p><p>I hate menus, I hate choosing food. I just want to be brought. Bring me dinner!</p><p>Food - I love nuts. I eat them all the time, they&#39;re easy to carry around, and I am never hungry all day long.</p><p>Most food you drop is still perfectly edible. If it was in your eyesight the whole time, you can pick it up and eat it.</p><p>There are a lot of food Nazis in the U.S., but I believe if you can show people what&#39;s really important, they&#39;ll judge the rest for themselves.</p><p>Food is no longer sacred to us: in becoming too efficient we&#39;ve changed its nature.</p><p>I think wine is such a big universe that it&#39;s kind of like food - it&#39;s intimidating to a lot of people, myself included.</p><p>People always comment about my clothes.

After a 12-hour day of shooting &#39;Chopped,&#39; say, I&#39;m talking stir-fry, spaghetti, heck, peanut-butter sandwiches. But that&#39;s not about the joy of food. That&#39;s survival.</p><p>I think what I do differently from a lot of TV chefs is that I break down barriers and make fine food more accessible to the regular person, who might be intimidated. I try hard, particularly with wine, to make it not intimidating. It&#39;s sort of a teaching job.</p><p>The interesting thing is, while we die of diseases of affluence from eating all these fatty meats, our poor brethren in the developing world die of diseases of poverty, because the land is not used now to grow food grain for their families.</p><p>Back in 1983, the United States government approved the release of the first genetically modified organism.

I love food, it&#39;s one of the best things on this planet. But I changed the way I was thinking. I started asking myself, &#39;Hey, am I eating because it tastes good? Or because I really need some more? Am I really still hungry?&#39;</p><p>I don&#39;t enjoy good food. I don&#39;t enjoy flashy cars. I don&#39;t care if I live in a dump. I don&#39;t enjoy good clothes. This is the best I&#39;ve dressed in months.</p><p>It&#39;s all about who&#39;s where on the food chain. When I&#39;m the story editor, I expect my writers to follow my vision. When I&#39;m working for another editor, I&#39;m obliged to follow their vision.</p><p>I moved to New York last year and I love it. It&#39;s a huge change and I&#39;ve always wanted to spend time there. It&#39;s like a more intense London, and everything&#39;s up a few notches. The lights are brighter, the pace is faster and the food&#39;s better.</p><p>And I think of that again as I&#39;ve written in several of my beauty books, a lot of health comes from the proper eating habits, which are something that - you know, I come from a generation that wasn&#39;t - didn&#39;t have a lot of food.</p><p>There are pockets of great food in Spain, but there are also pockets of very mediocre food in Spain, and the same in Morocco and the same in Croatia and the same in Germany and the same in Austria.</p><p>Finishing food is about the tiny touches. In the last seconds you can change everything.</p><p>Everyone makes pesto in a food processor. But the texture is better with a mortar and pestle, and it&#39;s just as fast.</p><p>As far away as you can get from the process of mechanisms and machinery, the more likely your food&#39;s going to taste good. And that - that is probably the largest thing I can hand to anybody is let your hands touch it. Let them make it.</p><p>When you cut that eggplant up and you roast it in the oven and you make the tomato sauce and you put it on top, your soul is in that food, and there&#39;s something about that that can never be made by a company that has three million employees.</p><p>Bologna is the best city in Italy for food and has the least number of tourists. With its medieval beauty, it has it all.</p><p>Shop often, shop hard, and spend for the best stuff available - logic dictates that you can make delicious food only with delicious ingredients.</p><p>Unlike curing cancer or heart disease, we already know how to beat hunger: food.</p><p>I was at a party, and some squiggly looking dude with a bow tie came up and said, &#39;How&#39;d you like to be on TV?&#39; Turns out he was the programming guy at the Food Network. They had me come into the office, and I did a &#39;Ready, Set, Cook&#39; with Emeril Lagasse, I believe.</p><p>Cookbooks have all become baroque and very predictable. I&#39;m looking for something different. A lot of chefs&#39; cookbooks are food as it&#39;s done in the restaurants, but they are dumbed down, and I hate it when they dumb them down.</p><p>My last meal? The food would be much less significant than the company.</p><p>When I was growing up in Mississippi - it was good Southern food... but I also grew up with a Greek family when other kids were eating fried okra, we were eating steamed artichokes. So I think it played a big part in my healthy cooking.</p><p>My Mom always cooked healthy. Greek food lends itself to cooking healthy.</p><p>I think the biggest thing is clean as you go. Wash all your knives, cutting boards, dishes, when you are done cooking, not look at a sink full of dishes after you are done. Cleaning as you go helps keep away cross contamination and you avoid having food borne bacteria.</p><p>It&#39;s fun to pick a cuisine and say I&#39;m going to research Ethiopian food, and see what it&#39;s all about. You find that there are a lot of similarities in cuisines from around the world and a lot of similar flavors.</p><p>We incorporated new tastes and flavors into our kids&#39; diets from a very early age, which helped to develop their palates and prevented them from becoming picky eaters. We don&#39;t buy junk food and give them options of fresh fruit, yogurt, raw almonds, or dried whole grain cereals for snack time.</p><p>I would like a food/lifestyle show. We&#39;re not sure what that is yet. I want to be able to share what I do and how I raise my family. I feel like I have a story to tell. I enjoy talking and listening, sharing ideas and sharing advice.</p><p>Chronic malnutrition, or the lack of proper nutrition over time directly contributes to three times as many child deaths as food scarcity. Yet surprisingly, you don&#39;t really hear about this hidden crisis through the morning news, Twitter or headlines of major newspapers.</p><p>I think about food all the time. It&#39;s my passion it&#39;s my profession. But some people think about food all the time because they&#39;re hungry. We can put an end to this if we join forces and lend a hand.</p><p>I think people are more savvy about cooking, food and dining. I notice they are looking for more value for their money - not in larger portions but more in terms of healthier, fresh, farm-to-table dishes with a nice presentation.</p><p>I like to abide by the seasons and let the natural flavor in food speak for itself. I use quick cooking techniques of high heat with very little fat, such as quick saute or wok stir-frying.</p><p>I add a lot of citrus to my food and I think that flavors it. And, to me, that what makes it healthier, lower in fat, lower in calories. It adds lots of flavor. Spices, of course. But citrus is definitely kind of my go-to to season and really to really make those flavors, make that food come alive.</p><p>Even more importantly, it&#39;s wine, food and the arts. Incorporating those three enhances the quality of life.</p><p>Don&#39;t you have a machine that puts food into the mouth and pushes it down?</p><p>When my work gets crazy, I make sure to always have vitamins, water and proper food with me. That has helped me to lose 33 pounds.</p><p>When you love food as much as I do, staying healthy is not easy. I mean, moderation, not deprivation. That&#39;s my new way of living. I always want more and that&#39;s just my life.</p><p>I used food as a coping mechanism for many, many years, and it was my best friend for a long time.</p><p>Food decisions - do I eat this or not? - are always going to be there.</p><p>I always think I am one of the millions and millions of people that struggles with an addiction to food. I don&#39;t know how to relax, that&#39;s my problem.</p><p>My work has also motivated me to put a lot of time into seeking out good food and to spend more money on it.</p><p>In addition to contributing to erosion, pollution, food poisoning, and the dead zone, corn requires huge amounts of fossil fuel - it takes a half gallon of fossil fuel to produce a bushel of corn.</p><p>I just like food too much, and I don&#39;t want to change. I spent so much of childhood trying to change, and I just got sick of it... I don&#39;t want to look like Britney Spears, I just don&#39;t want to. She&#39;s hideous.</p><p>Olympia was a town crawling with music. I was new to the whole punk scene. The culture shock continued Olympia had bagels! We didn&#39;t have bagels in Arkansas. You could order vegetarian food all over town! It was so crazy to me - a place with so many vegetarians, the restaurants made special dishes for them?</p><p>If my daughter wants to get into this business, I would support that decision. She&#39;s going to have a hard time not being in it. She loves food and she&#39;s around it all the time.</p><p>For me, it&#39;s all about moderation. I don&#39;t kick things out of my diet, like carbs. But I&#39;m not going to eat fast food.</p><p>When I go to a restaurant, I eat three-quarters of the food in front of me. That cuts my calorie intake by 25 percent.</p><p>The Food Network&#39; was just starting in New York, and I was getting lots of attention from Mesa Grill. They had no money, so if you couldn&#39;t get there by subway, you couldn&#39;t be on. It wasn&#39;t like TV was something I really wanted to do - but I knew it would be great publicity for my restaurants.;Bobby Flay;food 23514;I wasn&#39;t passionate about food until I&#39;d been cooking for a while. I started long before food became part of the mainstream media. I just wanted to cook, period.;Bobby Flay;food 23515;Nobody believed the &#39;Food Network&#39; could last. Even I was short sighted and thought to myself, 24 hours of food on TV? They&#39;ll run out of things to talk about in four days! But that wasn&#39;t true. &#39;Food Network&#39; continues to get better and evolve.;Bobby Flay;food 23516;Don&#39;t try to be the next Rachael Ray or Bobby Flay, we already have those people. We want someone who is going to make their own mark on &#39;Food Network.</p><p>Basically, there are two things we know: Everybody has less time, and the general public is demanding better food - better in terms of quality and better in terms of flavor.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t relate to kid stuff. &#39;Jimmy doesn&#39;t like me!&#39; Who cares? I was worried we didn&#39;t have gas money or food. Those were my concerns.</p><p>I don&#39;t let it bother me too much if someone doesn&#39;t like me. I just figure there&#39;s no accounting for taste. It&#39;s not me, it&#39;s my acting. It&#39;s like if someone doesn&#39;t like someone&#39;s food, they just don&#39;t like my acting.</p><p>Well mine is not gimmicky - it is the 6 food groups that God made, and exercising every day. Trying to think positively.</p><p>Progress would not have been the rarity it is if the early food had not been the late poison.</p><p>The number one mistake is giving pets table scraps. I made the mistake thinking I was showing my dog love by giving her food and treats. You see a tiny 4 oz. piece of cheese, but for a Boston Terrier like mine, that&#39;s like one and a half hamburgers. That&#39;s unhealthy.</p><p>There are times, like after a long day of work, when the thought of an easy drive-through is enticing. But then I remember how crappy I felt when I ate fast food in the past, and it inspires me to head to the grocery store or my local farmer&#39;s market and whip up an easy but healthier option.</p><p>I have encouraged my kids to eat well from day one. I add flavor - herbs and spices - to everything because I don&#39;t want them getting used to starchy, bland food. I also want them to experiment - they don&#39;t have to love everything, but they do have to try it.</p><p>I try to eat in a way that makes me feel good. If that means a little bite of chocolate I do that, but I try not to use food as a reward for myself.</p><p>If there is to be any hope of prosperity for this country it is by reversing that policy which made us simply the kitchen garden for supplying the British with cheap food.</p><p>Eating when you&#39;re not hungry and taking in that amount of food is exhausting.</p><p>Just because the Americans are so good at rattling out accessible and cheap junk food, nobody looks twice when it comes to their food. But there are golden nuggets everywhere.</p><p>He looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.</p><p>I&#39;m lucky because my dad taught me to be frugal and save. And that&#39;s important because I want to know that I don&#39;t have to take an acting job for two or three years if I don&#39;t want to and that I&#39;ll still be able to make my house and car payments and buy food for my dogs.</p><p>I&#39;ve worked on films where the budgets are almost limitless and you&#39;re in trailers that are bigger than a hotel room. You&#39;re taken care of and the food is amazing, the quality of the job is amazing and then you work on smaller things but it never dictates my happiness or my willingness to go to work.</p><p>I am your fairy tale. Your dream. Your wishes and desires, and I am your thirst and your hunger and your food and your drink.</p><p>The music I do is food... that will be your dinner.</p><p>A society that thinks the choice between ways of living is just a choice between equally eligible &#39;lifestyles&#39; turns universities into academic cafeterias offering junk food for the mind.</p><p>I love to cook so much. I like to cook everything. I really like to eat my food.</p><p>No matter where I&#39;ve been overseas, the food stinks, except in Italy.</p><p>I love food, I love eating.</p><p>I don&#39;t have a dime left. I am dependent on my friends for food and a small old-age pension.</p><p>Well, food&#39;s always the way to anybody&#39;s heart, I think, guy or girl.</p><p>People need dreams, there&#39;s as much nourishment in &#39;em as food.</p><p>People come up to me all the time and say, &#39;Oh, I love to watch Food Network,&#39; and I ask them what they cook, and they say, &#39;I don&#39;t really cook.&#39; They&#39;re afraid, they&#39;re intimidated, they know all about food from eating out and watching TV, but they don&#39;t know where to start in their own kitchen.</p><p>Somewhere between 50 to 60 percent of the food you eat has been touched by immigrant hands, and it is fair to say some of them are not here as they should be here. But if you didn&#39;t have these folks, you would be spending a lot more - three, four or five times more - for food, or we would have to import food and have all the food security risks.</p><p>Local and regional food systems are about opportunity.</p><p>The food pyramid is very complicated. It doesn&#39;t give you as much info in a quick glance as the plate does.</p><p>You know, rural Americans are a special people. Their labor puts food on our table and fuel in our gas tanks. Their service in our military sets a powerful example of leadership, honor and sacrifice. Their spirit of community inspires us all.</p><p>Let us build a 21st-century rural economy of cutting-edge companies and technologies that lead us to energy and food security. Such an investment will revitalize rural America, re-establish our moral leadership on climate security and eliminate our addiction to foreign oil.</p><p>Food during my early years was a very difficult issue for me. I grew up in an addictive family. My mother had serious problems with alcohol and prescription drugs. I was an overweight kid. I can remember back in those days there weren&#39;t the strategies that there are today to deal with those issues.</p><p>Food is a fairly significant aspect of my life. I have struggled mightily with food. With my weight. And I&#39;m conscious of it. So I have a sensitivity to people who struggle with their weight.</p><p>If you think of what food is, it&#39;s the energy we use to do our daily work. I want people to know about the USDA. This is a very important department. It&#39;s not fully appreciated as such.</p><p>You know how you wake up in the morning and sometimes you look gorgeous and other times you look like you got hit by a mack truck? I realized that my mack truck is food. If I have no sugar, yeast or wine, I have no undereye bags and my skin is perfect.</p><p>As long as there&#39;s pasta and Chinese food in the world, I&#39;m okay.</p><p>All artists are people of growth. It&#39;s like food, you take the good and leave the rest.</p><p>Compassion is a call, a demand of nature, to relieve the unhappy as hunger is a natural call for food.</p><p>My feeling is that labels are for canned food... I am what I am - and I know what I am.</p><p>I love home cooking, and I&#39;m not a great one for fast food.</p><p>When I&#39;m filming, survival requires movement. You need your energy, and you&#39;ve got to eat the bad stuff, and survival food is rarely pretty, but you kind of do it. I get in that zone, and I eat the nasty stuff, but I&#39;m not like that when I&#39;m back home.</p><p>Jackie Chan is a very good comedy/martial arts star. He does one kind of martial arts that Jet Li doesn&#39;t know how to do and Jet Li does a martial art that Jackie Chan doesn&#39;t know how to do. You can both go to two Chinese restaurants, but both can have different kinds of food.</p><p>I only like food without color, like potatoes, bread, and pasta.</p><p>Stuffing is my favorite food in the world! I actually have been known to go buy stuffing and make it in the middle of summer.</p><p>Food is for eating, and good food is to be enjoyed... I think food is, actually, very beautiful in itself.</p><p>When you&#39;re out grocery shopping for your family, maybe you can put a can of cat or dog food in your cart and bring it to an animal relief center.</p><p>I don&#39;t categorize food as bad or a guilty pleasure.</p><p>The magazine, the daytime show, we&#39;ve always tried to write affordable, accessible. Those are key words for us, and I do mean us, a huge staff of people at the magazine who love to cook affordable, friendly food that helps families eat better for less.</p><p>You know, food is such - it&#39;s a hug for people.</p><p>My husband cooks fancier food for himself than I&#39;ve ever cooked on-air. I call him from the road, and he&#39;s making champagne-vanilla salmon or black-cherry pork chop. Half of me is feeling unworthy. Not only am I not a chef, I&#39;m not a better cook than my own husband!</p><p>It only looks like I get to eat a lot of food on TV. I really just get the one bite and the crew and guests eat everything else.</p><p>When I do a 30-minute meal, for instance, on Food Network, that&#39;s my food you see at the end of the show and it&#39;s not perfect. And if sometimes things break or drop or the pasta hits the wall when I&#39;m draining it, they never stop tape. They just kind of let me go with it.</p><p>My mom, who&#39;s been in the restaurant business for 40 years, is the number-one influence in my life. But I look up to a lot of people in the industry. Tops on my list is Mario Batali. My mom and Mario taught me the same lesson: Food is love.</p><p>Good food and a warm kitchen are what makes a house a home. I always tried to make my home like my mother&#39;s, because Mom was magnificent at stretching a buck when it came to decorating and food. Like a true Italian, she valued beautification in every area of her life, and I try to do the same.</p><p>I would say, stay the hell away from the party scene. Anything you put in front of your goal, and especially something like that, whether it&#39;s too much gambling, too much food, too much cold beers on the weekend - anything that you put in front of the prize is going to end up getting in the way and hurting you in the end.</p><p>A human being has been given an intellect to make choices, and we know there are other food sources that do not require the killing of a creature that would protest being killed.</p><p>A lot of people think Japanese food is difficult, a lot of work. But you don&#39;t have to buy the knife I have. You don&#39;t have to train as long as I have. You can do my cooking in your kitchen.</p><p>My late wife Olympia was Goan and I&#39;ve been to India many times. I love the food there. We used to do our shopping in Southall, where you can find cheap but wonderful fruit like mangoes, vegetables and spices. I didn&#39;t do much of the cooking, as Olympia did a lot - I was the under-chef and did some of the chopping.</p><p>The food in the House of Commons is fairly good. The cafe in Portcullis House is really very high quality, and you also have a choice of eating in the more traditional restaurants, the Churchill Room or the Members&#39; Dining Room. I don&#39;t often eat in them, though, as I&#39;m usually on the run.</p><p>I love spicy food.</p><p>I feed my kids organic food and milk, but I&#39;ve also been known to buy the odd Lunchable. My kids are not allowed to watch TV during the week, but on weekends even the 2-year-old veges out to &#39;The Simpsons.&#39;</p><p>It makes me so angry - there&#39;s enough food in the world but people are starving. It&#39;s all political.</p><p>Clearly, America&#39;s dysfunctional food culture must bear some of the blame for our excess pounds, but it&#39;s likely our walking-averse lifestyles contribute as well.</p><p>Everyone prefers some foods over others, but some adults take this tendency to an extreme. These people tend to prefer the kinds of bland food they may have enjoyed as children - such as plain or buttered pasta, macaroni and cheese, cheese pizza, French fries and grilled cheese sandwiches - and to restrict their eating to just a few dishes.</p><p>It does kids no favors, and sets them up for a potential lifetime of poor health and social embarrassment, to excuse them from family meals of real food. Everyone benefits from healthy eating, but it is particularly crucial at the beginning of life.</p><p>A lot of times on tour it&#39;s about, &#39;OK, where am I today? Wow, I&#39;m in Costa Rica. What is their famous dish?&#39; And it&#39;s about trying the food, and really experiencing it.</p><p>I can safely say that other than macaroni and cheese, there&#39;s no processed food in my life. There&#39;s no inorganic food in my life these days. There&#39;s no junk food. There&#39;s not a lot of sugar. There&#39;s no soy. I mean, really everything that&#39;s going into my body is pretty pure.</p><p>There is no reasoning, no process of inference or comparison there is no thinking about things, no putting two and two together there are no ideas - the animal does not think of the box or of the food or of the act he is to perform.</p><p>If newspapers were a baseball team, they would be the Mets - without the hope for those folks at the very pinnacle of the financial food chain - who average nearly $24 million a year in income - &#39;next year.&#39;</p><p>The most used piece of kit in my kitchen is my saucepan. I use it every morning to cook my porridge in. The least used piece of equipment? I&#39;d say a food mixer. I&#39;ve never used it, I don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re for.</p><p>When I want comfort food, I buy Maltesers. I like all chocolates, but especially those. You can eat them, and because they&#39;re so light, you can convince yourself that they are not actually that fattening.</p><p>Anybody who finds it easy to make money on the horses is probably in the dog food business.</p><p>I love &#39;Top Chef.&#39; I think it rewrote the book on how food shows are presented on TV.</p><p>St. Louis has a lot of weird food customs that you don&#39;t see other places - and a lot of great ethnic neighborhoods. There&#39;s a German neighborhood. A great old school Italian neighborhood, with toasted ravioli, which seems to be a St. Louis tradition. And they love provolone cheese in St. Louis.</p><p>Customers want good value, but they care more than ever how food and clothing products are made.</p><p>People ask me how I keep my figure, and I tell them it&#39;s because I paint. When you&#39;re covered in paint, it&#39;s quite hard to put food in your mouth!</p><p>It is great to add some glamour to the food industry, like television shows have done for the food world and inspiring people to work in the industry. The flip side of that is unfortunately people think that after they get their qualifications, they get their invitation to compete on &#39;Top Chef.&#39;</p><p>There are probably close to a million people in the hospitality industry here in the United States, and there are probably only a few hundred opportunities in the food media industry.</p><p>For me, food is all about balance. If you eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and an appropriate amount of poultry, fish, and red meat that are sourced from good places, you&#39;re doing well. It&#39;s important to make sure that the meat you&#39;re consuming is hormone-free.</p><p>In my travels, I also noticed that kids in Thailand like spicy food, and kids in India love curry. I&#39;m hoping to introduce my son, Hudson, to lots of veggies and spices when he&#39;s young. I say that before he&#39;s started on solid foods, so it could be easier in theory than practice!</p><p>I need protein from food rather than just protein supplements. I changed my diet.</p><p>The best thing you can do for someone is make them a beautiful plate of food. How else can you invade someone&#39;s body without actually touching them?</p><p>Wine, like food, is so emotional. If you think about it, so much of the courting ritual is surrounded by wine and food. There&#39;s a built-in romance to wine.</p><p>I really like to sometimes go into food detox and eat very simply.</p><p>Part of my job as a food writer is to describe food. So my work on &#39;Top Chef,&#39; I feel, is an extension of that. When we give a criticism to the contestant, we want to make sure we tell them why it&#39;s not working and why it would work if they did it a different way.</p><p>From the simple stringing together of lemon garlands for the goddess Durga, to dividing the prasadam or blessed foods for the children first, I came to associate food not only with feminity, but also with purity and divinity.</p><p>We tend to connect bad food and bad habits with romance and sex.</p><p>Australia is the only island continent on the planet, which means that changes caused by planet-warming pollution - warmer seas, which can drive stronger storms, and more acidic oceans, which wreak havoc on the food chain - are even more deadly here.</p><p>With nine degrees of warming, computer models project that Australia will look like a disaster movie. Habitats for most vertebrates will vanish. Water supply to the Murray-Darling Basin will fall by half, severely curtailing food production.</p><p>They&#39;re now turning those seeds into intellectual property, so they have a virtual lock on the seeds upon which we all depend for our food and survival.</p><p>We are already producing enough food to feed the world. We already have technology in place that allows us to produce more than we can find a market for.</p><p>The American public is not aware that there might be potential allergenic and toxic reactions. With regular food, at least people know which foods they have an allergy to.</p><p>The public should know that the liability issues here have yet to be resolved, or even raised. If you&#39;re a farmer and you&#39;re growing a genetically engineering food crop, those genes are going to flow to the other farm.</p><p>I love Alton Brown&#39;s show &#39;Good Eats,&#39; about the chemistry of food. It&#39;s really thoughtful.</p><p>The thing about all my food is that everything is a remembered flavor. Maybe it&#39;s something I had as a child or maybe it&#39;s something I had in Milan, but I want it to taste better than you ever thought.</p><p>I worked for the Office of Management and Budget in the White House, on nuclear energy policy. But I decided it would be much more fun to have a specialty food store, so I left Washington D.C. and moved to the Hamptons. And how glad I am that I did!</p><p>There&#39;s nothing more romantic than Italian food.</p><p>No, I love Montreal... I think I love Montreal more than Montreal loves me... I love the food there.</p><p>Food is my thing, I do not smoke or drink, so food is my vice.</p><p>I just don&#39;t crave junk food.</p><p>I don&#39;t feel any pressure to lose weight - and in any case, if I didn&#39;t have my food I&#39;d be a nasty piece of work and wouldn&#39;t be able to function.</p><p>I want to make wines that harmonize with food - wines that almost hug your tongue with gentleness.</p><p>It&#39;s my first presenting role so I&#39;ll be nervous, but it&#39;s going to be great fun. I can&#39;t wait to sample the food and meet the celebrities. Hopefully I can inject some of my own glamour.</p><p>High-quality food is better for your health.</p><p>Let&#39;s keep the chemists over here and the food over here, that&#39;s my feeling. What do I know? But that is a big aspect of fast food is their ability to artificially taint the colors and the smells and stuff to stimulate appetite.</p><p>They did interviews with my wife and daughter-they were genuinely in fear of me having a heart attack, working 20 hours a day, eating fast food.</p><p>In England and America people tend to graze all day long, but I think it&#39;s such a waste to be constantly picking at food because you then can&#39;t enjoy a proper full meal when the time comes.</p><p>I have an enormous fondness for delicious food. It&#39;s very comforting.</p><p>Long as I was riding in a big Cadillac and dressed nice and had plenty of food, that&#39;s all I cared about.</p><p>Food is meant to be used as fuel for our bodies. If you&#39;re using it for any other reasons, take a step back and ask yourself, &#39;What&#39;s up.&#39;</p><p>I wanted to be a great white hunter, a prospector for gold, or a slave trader. But then, when I was eight, my parents sent me to a boarding school in South Africa. It was the equivalent of a British public school with cold showers, beatings and rotten food. But what it also had was a library full of books.</p><p>Even though I grew up as a Sephardic Jew in Brooklyn where we ate Syrian food and went to temple, it was still America.</p><p>Most of my life I was occupied with American television and American food. My ethnicity was my choice. It still is.</p><p>I&#39;m not really into gourmet food I&#39;m the kind of guy who just stops by a place that looks good rather than heading for the restaurant of the moment.</p><p>I love Italian food but that&#39;s too generic a term for what&#39;s available now: you have to narrow it down to Tuscan, Sicilian, and so on.</p><p>I&#39;m obsessed with food!</p><p>It&#39;s easy to be lazy when there&#39;s food lying around backstage or there&#39;s a fast-food joint a couple blocks away. But if you walk a little further, ask around a bit, of course there are exciting things to discover.</p><p>The wonderful thing about Food for Thought is that it lets you keep your hand in theater and be in front of a live audience without a commitment of six months, or even three months.</p><p>Food was a constant topic of conversation in our household.</p><p>Every country can be defined through their food, their music and their language. That&#39;s the soul of a country.</p><p>I have a fear of poverty in old age. I have this vision of myself living in a skip and eating cat food. It&#39;s because I&#39;m freelance, and I&#39;ve never had a proper job. I don&#39;t have a pension, and my savings are dwindling. I always thought someone would just come along and look after me.</p><p>For much of the female half of the world, food is the first signal of our inferiority. It lets us know that our own families may consider female bodies to be less deserving, less needy, less valuable.</p><p>My grandmother was the greatest cook in the world. She could just go in there, the whole kitchen would look like a tornado hit it and then she&#39;d come out with the best food. Then she&#39;d sit at the table and she wouldn&#39;t eat!</p><p>Absolutely, there is a connection between food and love. I always say, when there&#39;s love in my heart or I&#39;m feeling particularly good, the food comes out that much better. And so I think Valentine&#39;s Day is a special day.</p><p>When the farmer can sell directly to the consumer, it is a more active process. There&#39;s more contact. The consumer can know, who am I buying this from? What&#39;s their name? Do they have a face? Is the food they are selling coming out of Mexico with pesticides?</p><p>All I ever wanted to do was to make food accessible to everyone to show that you can make mistakes - I do all the time - but it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p>It&#39;s very clear that there&#39;s a lot of double standards going on. Should there be a 30mph speed limit? Of course there bloody should. And certainly with kids and school food, kids need to be nannied for sure. So give them a bloody good meal at school.</p><p>If you only design menus that are essentially junk or fast food, the whole infrastructure supports junk.</p><p>Give your kids a bloody knife and fork and let me put some fresh food in front of them they can eat.</p><p>Heads know that failing to invest in good, nutritious food is a false economy and parents won&#39;t tolerate reconstituted turkey being put back on the menu.</p><p>I want Americans to enjoy food. I want them to celebrate food. I want them to, on occasions, to have big cakes and great things. And I want them to indulge.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t say that processed food, ready meals and even takeaways aren&#39;t relevant to modern life, it&#39;s just that over the past 40 years there are three generations of people who have come out of school and gone through their home life without ever being shown how to cook properly.</p><p>The average housewife goes to the restaurant to relax and enjoy the food. But when Eva walks in, she becomes the center of attention.</p><p>Your diet is a bank account. Good food choices are good investments.</p><p>Never eat while doing something else, because you won&#39;t get the satisfaction from your food and you&#39;ll be more likely to overeat.</p><p>Food is not your best friend or enemy.</p><p>Part of treatment for drugs and alcohol is you abstain from these, but with eating disorders you can&#39;t abstain from food so the treatment is longer than drugs and alcohol.</p><p>You have to find a balance with food in your life - you can&#39;t take out food. It can be absolutely terrifying.</p><p>While weight loss is important, what&#39;s more important is the quality of food you put in your body - food is information that quickly changes your metabolism and genes.</p><p>A dead cow or sheep lying in a pasture is recognized as carrion. The same sort of a carcass dressed and hung up in a butcher&#39;s stall passes as food.</p><p>The food in such places is so tasteless because the members associate spices and garlic with just the sort of people they&#39;re trying to keep out.</p><p>When it comes to Chinese food I have always operated under the policy that the less known about the preparation the better. A wise diner who is invited to visit the kitchen replies by saying, as politely as possible, that he has a pressing engagement elsewhere.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever read a food piece or a food book.</p><p>I don&#39;t cook. I don&#39;t know anything about food. I&#39;ve never reviewed a restaurant.</p><p>Canadians are very well behaved, they don&#39;t throw their food.</p><p>Be what you would seem to be - or, if you&#39;d like it put more simply - a house is no home unless it contains food and fire for the mind as well as the body.</p><p>Japanese food makes me feel particularly good.</p><p>I was always the new kid in school, I&#39;m the kid from a broken family, I&#39;m the kid who had no dad showing up at the father-son stuff, I&#39;m the kid that was using food stamps at the grocery store.</p><p>When service members are discharged, we should express our gratitude for their profound personal sacrifice, not hand them a bill for their hospital food.</p><p>I love doing demonstrations. I think to be a great chef you have to be a great teacher. I love doing classes with people who love food and enjoy food, bringing them all around one table so to speak.</p><p>Recipes are important but only to a point. What&#39;s more important than recipes is how we think about food, and a good cookbook should open up a new way of doing just that.</p><p>Go to the grocery store and buy better things. Buy quality, buy organic, buy natural, go to the farmers market. Immediately that&#39;s going to increase the quality of the food you make.</p><p>I don&#39;t think any other holiday embraces the food of the Midwest quite like Thanksgiving. There&#39;s roasted meat and mashed potatoes. But being here is also about heritage. Cleveland is really a giant melting pot - not only is my family a melting pot, but so is the city.</p><p>My goal in &#39;Live to Cook&#39; is to make great food more approachable for home cooks.</p><p>I don&#39;t do yoga.

I&#39;m always excited about learning new things about food.</p><p>Creole is New Orleans city food. Communities were created by the people who wanted to stay and not go back to Spain or France.</p><p>Another nice thing was that I would type out letters home for the admiral&#39;s stewards. They would then feed me the same food the admiral ate.</p><p>I&#39;ve always felt that sexuality is a really slippery thing. In this day and age, it tends to get categorized and labeled, and I think labels are for food. Canned food.</p><p>I&#39;m reading a lot of different books, but I always think I have to switch it up a little bit. It&#39;s like food - everything in moderation, same with my books, same with my reading. You read books that are good for you and you learn a lot of stuff, then you read &#39;Fifty Shades of Grey,&#39; which is like candy.</p><p>I can&#39;t deliver lines, but I can talk about food all night long.</p><p>Hunger is a political issue, and there are several things politically that are keeping people hungry - not funding food stamps adequately, not funding school lunches adequately. So there is a political solution to the problem of hunger.</p><p>You can buy a box of low-fat macaroni and cheese made with powdered nonsense. I&#39;m not worried if I&#39;m using four different cheeses and it&#39;s high in fat. It&#39;s real food. That&#39;s what&#39;s more important.</p><p>I think steak is the ultimate comfort food, and if you&#39;re going out for one, that isn&#39;t the time to scrimp on calories or quality.</p><p>You have to know the classics if you want to cook modern food.</p><p>In New York, I&#39;ll walk down the street and someone will say, &#39;Nice show,&#39; and that&#39;s it. If I&#39;m at a food festival, it&#39;s open season.</p><p>As a chef, I had started working with groups like Share Our Strength and various local food banks in New York, raising money for hunger-related issues. And not only me, but the entire restaurant industry has been very focused on this issue.</p><p>There&#39;s the issue of hunger, and there&#39;s an issue of if you&#39;re going to cut out food programs. We should be focusing on healthy food. Right now, fruits and vegetables are very expensive. So what can we do on the policy side to bring the cost of fruits and vegetables down?</p><p>A couple of months ago, I was down in Florida for the Food and Wine Festival. And this journalist grabbed me and said, &#39;How does it feel to be a TV guy? You&#39;re no longer in the restaurant business.&#39; And I laughed. I asked him, &#39;How long do you think it takes me to do a season?&#39; He said, &#39;Well, 200 days.&#39; And I was like, &#39;200 days? Try 20!&#39;</p><p>Asian food is very easy to like because it hits your mouth very differently than European food does. In European food, there may be two things to hit - maybe sweet and salty, maybe salty-savory, but Asian kind of works around, plus you have that distinct flavor that&#39;s usually working in Asian food.</p><p>We are not really privy to all that crazy stuff that goes on in the show. I go to work, eat, and talk about food. The wild things happen when we aren&#39;t around. I expected Top Chef to last three or four seasons and we are now shooting season ten.</p><p>We&#39;re adults. We&#39;re the ones who should teach the kids what&#39;s good to eat. I don&#39;t think the government should ever regulate what we eat at home, but we&#39;re feeding them in school with tax dollars. Quite frankly, if my tax dollars are being spent to feed kids, I&#39;d rather feed them better food.</p><p>I travel around and hear from so many kids. Their parents say they were always very picky but they watch the show and they want to try stuff. The show is entertainment, but I think it has done so much for the public perception of what food can be.</p><p>There&#39;s a food revolution going on throughout the country. And it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re down south, up north in Maine, if you&#39;re out west in Portland or Seattle.</p><p>Everything is just better in California - the wine, the food, fruits and vegetables, the comforts of living. Even the instrumentalists are generous and curious. Everything is wonderful.</p><p>But it&#39;s really hard to eat good when you&#39;re traveling because you see fast food and you want to go to this restaurant and that restaurant.</p><p>But Australia faces additional regional and global challenges also crucial to our nation&#39;s future - climate change, questions of energy and food security, the rise of China and the rise of India. And we need a strong system of global and regional relationships and institutions to underpin stability.</p><p>You feel better when you&#39;re eating food that retains nutritional value.</p><p>In the States, you can buy Chinese food. In Beijing you can buy hamburger. It&#39;s very close. Now I feel the world become a big family, like a really big family. You have many neighbors. Not like before, two countries are far away.</p><p>The less you do to beautiful food, the better it&#39;s going to taste. You don&#39;t need to mess with it all the time.</p><p>Patience is the secret to good food.</p><p>I&#39;m tempted by everything. My husband makes fun of me because every day it&#39;s a new food that I love. I have a weakness for butterscotch pudding, ice cream in any flavor and dark chocolate, although that&#39;s one thing I do keep in my house - 70% dark chocolate.</p><p>Like baseball, food will never go out of style we will always need to eat and we will always find it entertaining. I think of food TV this way - all the fun and none of the calories.</p><p>There&#39;s not a single chef I know of that does not think about the politics of the food they&#39;re serving.</p><p>I had decided I wanted to write about food, and I knew the only way to do that is to speak with authority, which meant learning the language and knowing what that experience is like.</p><p>It&#39;s better to get the nutrients for healthy skin from food, not supplements. Salmon, walnuts, blueberries, spinach... lots of my favorite foods happen to be amazing for skin too.</p><p>There are days when I literally have to eat 17 plates of food - it&#39;s intense. It&#39;s about moderation. You just need a few bites to get the gist of a dish.</p><p>Find combinations of flavors you love and buy the best quality ingredients you can afford. Your food is only going to be as good as the sum of its parts, like anything else.</p><p>Fast sex, like fast food, is cheap, but it doesn&#39;t nourish the body - or the soul.</p><p>To me, food is as much about the moment, the occasion, the location and the company as it is about the taste.</p><p>I was born in the &#39;60s and grew up in the &#39;70s - not exactly the best decade for food in British history. It was horrendous. It was a time when, as a nation, we excelled in art and music and acting and photography and fashion - all creative skills... all apart from cooking.</p><p>You think about some of the most memorable meals you&#39;ve ever had the food will be good but it will often be about locating a mental memory and taste is inexorably linked to all the other senses and memory, so ultimately it is all about taste.</p><p>It&#39;s easy for people in an air-conditioned room to continue with the policies of destruction of Mother Earth. We need instead to put ourselves in the shoes of families in Bolivia and worldwide that lack water and food and suffer misery and hunger.</p><p>When I came to the Food Network, I didn&#39;t want to do a cooking show. I told Kathleen Finch for nine months I didn&#39;t want to do a cooking show, I wanted to do a home-and-garden show.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure that some of the food purists are in touch with what really goes on in American households.</p><p>It&#39;s really easy to figure out why I love what I love, the holidays and food. I know the difference between having them and not having them.</p><p>I&#39;m the only girl on The Food Network who grills - I have two bestselling grilling books. I try to really focus on what men and women can do outside together out on the grill. I think it&#39;s really fun to have men and women out there together, having fun, working and enjoying themselves.</p><p>I like doing food as a focal point on my table. It is not like going out and buying flowers or candles, which are expensive.</p><p>We have reduced sales tax on food. Now we want it eliminated.</p><p>Woe to us if we get our satisfaction from the food in the kitchen and the TV in the den and the sex in the bedroom with an occasional tribute to the cement blocks in the basement!</p><p>You can&#39;t escape the taste of the food you had as a child. In times of stress, what do you dream about? Your mother&#39;s clam chowder. It&#39;s security, comfort. It brings you home.</p><p>I say: If you don&#39;t know how to cook, I&#39;m sure you have at least one friend who knows how to cook. Well, call that friend and say, &#39;Can I come next time and can I bring some food and can I come an hour or two hours ahead and watch you and help you?&#39;</p><p>When I pair food and wine, I start with the food. If I have a beautiful roasted bird, I might choose a Cabernet or Pinot Noir, or maybe a Syrah, depending on the sauce and what is in my cellar.</p><p>I taped my first series for PBS in 1982 at WJCT-TV in Jacksonville, Florida. The show, called &#39;Everyday Cooking with Jacques Pepin,&#39; was about saving time and money in the kitchen - and it was a celebration of simple and unpretentious food.</p><p>When I wrote &#39;Fast Food My Way&#39; in 2004, I hoped that my friends would prepare my recipes. Now, more people cook from that book than any other I&#39;ve written in the past 30 years.</p><p>This June, I&#39;ll travel once again to the Food and Wine Magazine Classic in Aspen, Colorado. For many years, my dear friend Julia Child and I have teamed up to teach classes together at the event for the past seven years, my daughter, Claudine, has been my cooking partner on stage.</p><p>The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food.</p><p>Somewhere near you, somebody right now is trying to help the indigent and poor - providing food, shelter, clothing or simple kindness.</p><p>When it becomes hard for me not to eat bad food, I try to think about what I have to do and what is ahead of me and what I want to achieve.</p><p>Anorexia, you starve yourself. Bulimia, you binge and purge. You eat huge amounts of food until you&#39;re sick and then you throw up. And anorexia, you just deny yourself. It&#39;s about control.</p><p>Acceptable food rots while we are chased from bins behind restaurants, chased from sleeping on the street, chased from relieving ourselves unless we pay for food or gas, until finally we are so hungry, sleepless, smelly, constipated and beaten-down that we simply die of lack of will to live.</p><p>Yet food is something that is taken for granted by most world leaders despite the fact that more than half of the population of the world is hungry.</p><p>Almost certainly, however, the first essential component of social justice is adequate food for all mankind.</p><p>Entrepreneurs always pitch their idea as &#39;the X of Y&#39;, so this is going to be &#39;the Microsoft of food.&#39; And yet disruptive innovations usually don&#39;t have that character. Most of the time, if something seems like a good idea, it probably isn&#39;t.</p><p>Men can absent themselves from real life for their art more easily. Women are anchored into the quotidian business of getting food on the table, making sure everybody&#39;s socks match, the soccer gear is ready. I admire idealists, but they&#39;re usually enabled by someone who holds the tether on their balloon, who pays the bills and sweeps up after them.</p><p>Especially for me, growing up in such a small town in the middle of nowhere, the desire to be away was incredible. I wanted to see new lands, meet new people from the city, and meet people that were in much less fortunate situations than I was, so that I could be more appreciative of my present. At least I had food on the table.</p><p>I used to work a lot on food issues and every time somebody predicted that production would be inadequate they got egg on their face a year or two later.</p><p>I&#39;m not a Luddite, but I&#39;m outside more than I&#39;m on my computer. We have a micro-farm - it&#39;s a step up from a garden. We have a pretty extensive vineyard. We grow about 60 percent of our own food, make our own wine, have chickens for eggs.</p><p>I probably grow half my food. It&#39;s a good way to keep perspective.</p><p>I&#39;ve been very lucky in the characters I&#39;ve chosen. Up until last year I was a nobody. I did jobs I booked because I needed to put food in my mouth.</p><p>When women earn the money for the family, everyone in the family benefits. We also know that when women have an income, everyone wins because women dedicate 90% of the income to health, education, to food security, to the children, to the family, or to the community, so when women have an income, everybody wins.</p><p>We simply can no longer afford to deny the full potential of one half of the population. The world needs to tap into the talent and wisdom of women. Whether the issue is food security, economic recovery, health, or peace and security, the participation of women is needed now more than ever.</p><p>Yeah, well, food is always a part of everything.</p><p>It makes sense that we came up with our public school system during the Industrial Revolution because it&#39;s like everybody is a factory worker, eating their terrible food and going back to the room where you&#39;re silent and listening to an idiot. That&#39;s an epitomizing idea, getting called &#39;Nothing&#39; for your whole high school experience.</p><p>Doing things like playing music, something that&#39;s so natural and basic to human function, running around in nature, eating delicious food. These things are intrinsic in basic, primordial to human beings, so that&#39;s sort of a way to return to a blank canvas, allowing my true personality to return.</p><p>Hash browns are my favorite breakfast food.</p><p>I normally don&#39;t eat junk food.</p><p>I don&#39;t like to waste anything. Any food left over from the night before is always eaten the next day.</p><p>As long as the food is well prepared and not overdone, I think it tastes good. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s Chinese, Japanese, anything.</p><p>I used to get criticized for putting food in novels.</p><p>I loved everything about Spain - the people, the language, and the food!</p><p>My quest these days is to find my long lost inner child, but I&#39;m afraid if I do, I&#39;ll end up with food in my hair and way too in love with the cats.</p><p>Urban conservationists may feel entitled to be unconcerned about food production because they are not farmers. But they can&#39;t be let off so easily, for they are all farming by proxy.</p><p>I buy food and gasoline - that&#39;s it.</p><p>I always knew the importance of it, since I was three or four years old my mother used to feed me wine and water. I grew up with wine as liquid food.</p><p>If you go back to the Greeks and Romans, they talk about all three - wine, food, and art - as a way of enhancing life.</p><p>When I hosted the dinner I served fast food hamburgers. It had nothing to do with black, white, purple, yellow, green race. it had nothing to do with Tiger or his family or his golf game.</p><p>As a freelance writer, I&#39;d be asked to become an expert for various magazines on any subject, whether food or wine or history or the life span of veterinarians. I was completely unschooled in any of these things.</p><p>Music is my No. 1 passion. If you made me choose between music and food, it&#39;s definitely music.</p><p>One can hardly be Indian and not know that almost every accent, which hand you eat your food with, has some deeper symbolic truth, reality.</p><p>Everyone would talk about their diets and working out and what it made me do was go to craft services where all the food for the cast and crew was and I would eat.</p><p>In corn, I think I&#39;ve found the key to the American food chain. If you look at a fast-food meal, a McDonald&#39;s meal, virtually all the carbon in it - and what we eat is mostly carbon - comes from corn.</p><p>At home I serve the kind of food I know the story behind.</p><p>Corn is an efficient way to get energy calories off the land and soybeans are an efficient way of getting protein off the land, so we&#39;ve designed a food system that produces a lot of cheap corn and soybeans resulting in a lot of cheap fast food.</p><p>Perhaps more than any other, the food industry is very sensitive to consumer demand.</p><p>People in Slow Food understand that food is an environmental issue.</p><p>Fairness forces you - even when you&#39;re writing a piece highly critical of, say, genetically modified food, as I have done - to make sure you represent the other side as extensively and as accurately as you possibly can.</p><p>If you&#39;re out, and starving, and need a bite to eat, then you need fast food.</p><p>A few years ago, kids from poor areas in France were asked to draw items of food. For a chicken, they drew a drumstick. For a fish, they drew a fish stick. Those are extremes, but there is a lot that needs to be done to help children discover good food.</p><p>Talking about food is like talking about your dreams. Everyone has something to say. We all have to eat, it&#39;s just what we eat which differs. Some people eat for fuel and I feel bad for them.</p><p>Mexican food is far more varied than people think. It changes like dialects. I was brought up in Jalisco by the sea on a basic diet - tomatoes, chillis, peppers of every size and rice, which is a Mexican staple. The Pacific coast has a huge array of seafood.</p><p>I think the water dictates how food will taste in a country. In England the apples taste unlike apples grown in any other place. England is an island, there&#39;s a lot of salt in the air and in the water. I think that has something to do with it.</p><p>Latin food suffers like Chinese. You can do marginal Chinese and be successful. You can do crappy Mexican and be packed.</p><p>Murals in restaurants are on a par with the food in museums.</p><p>The murals in restaurants are on par with the food in museums.</p><p>I get way too much happiness from good food.</p><p>Money spent on carbon cuts is money we can&#39;t use for effective investments in food aid, micronutrients, HIV/AIDS prevention, health and education infrastructure, and clean water and sanitation.</p><p>I believe food is the most brilliant invention ever.</p><p>I am a serious food lover and Peruvian cuisine is one of the best in the world.</p><p>From the minute I wake up until I go to bed I think about food.</p><p>My perfect day is constantly changing. Right now, it would be to lie around in a hammock reading with a portable phone and a table of food next to it. I would spend all day there. And that&#39;s all that I can possibly come up with on the spur of the moment.</p><p>For me, first, it&#39;s finding quiet in my life - and I do that through yoga and meditation. It&#39;s also been a matter of changing the way I eat, because I think what we eat can inform who we are food is a chemical and a drug to a certain extent.</p><p>What I&#39;ve been developing is a vegan fast food chain and vegan food markets.</p><p>I got a fascination with food.</p><p>I had no accomplishments except surviving. But that isn&#39;t enough in the community where I came from, because everybody was doing it. So I wasn&#39;t prepared for America, where everybody is glowing with good teeth and good clothes and food.</p><p>My parents owned a soul food diner. It inspired me to go to culinary school.</p><p>I love tiny, plastic realistic food magnets. I don&#39;t know why. They&#39;re hilarious.</p><p>I&#39;m not a food critic, and I&#39;m not really an authority to write anything on food.</p><p>A lot of food criticism has a similar flavor to it, and I&#39;m probably going to write about it in a different way.</p><p>My mother accidentally gave me food poisoning. She fed me baby carrots for a snack before Christmas dinner - but they had expired in June! I threw up for the next 24 hours.</p><p>They advertise on the radio for food stamps!</p><p>Not to like ice cream is to show oneself uninterested in food.</p><p>I like food too much to go on some crazy diet. French fries are my favorite downfall.</p><p>Since I&#39;ve been pregnant, I&#39;ve lost my taste for fast food. I used to be the biggest McDonald&#39;s junkie and now I don&#39;t like it anymore. I used to be the biggest fast-food connoisseur, and now I&#39;ve really lost my taste for it.</p><p>I love chicken fingers, I love French fries. I love desserts. I&#39;m not just into dessert or just into savoury food. I love it all. I&#39;m a pig. I love food. So it takes a lot of discipline to eat healthy.</p><p>If the first requisite for writing well about food is a good appetite, the second is to put in your apprenticeship as a feeder when you have enough money to pay the check but not enough to produce indifference of the total.</p><p>The primary requisite for writing well about food is a good appetite. Without this, it is impossible to accumulate, within the allotted span, enough experience of eating to have anything worth setting down.</p><p>Each of us needs something - food, liquor, pot, whatever - to help us survive. Dracula needs blood.</p><p>And on a Canadian set, everybody is equal. You get paid the same. You live together in barracks. You have a communal kitchen. You buy and cook your own food.</p><p>I came literally to the table with a wealth of knowledge by simply understanding how food should taste.</p><p>I have an amazing relationship with food.</p><p>Grief is a bad moon, a sleeper wave. It&#39;s like having an inner combatant, a saboteur who, at the slightest change in the sunlight, or at the first notes of a jingle for a dog food commercial, will flick the memory switch, bringing tears to your eyes.</p><p>I love to cook comfort food. I&#39;ll make fish and vegetables or meat and vegetables and potatoes or rice. The ritual of it is fun for me, and the creativity of it.</p><p>There have been nine Super Bowls in New Orleans, and not all of them have brought the best of luck to NFL Films. We got robbed twice there, got food poisoning, and my hotel room was broken into on the day the Bears played the Patriots in January 1986.</p><p>Many people submit to excessive appetites without realizing that they do not need to eat so much food.</p><p>What we are trying to do is to create a social business in Bangladesh, a joint venture to create restaurants for common people. Good, healthy food at affordable prices so that people don&#39;t have to opt for food that is unhealthy and unhygienic.</p><p>I&#39;m not too into fast food, but you know if I was, it would be chicken.</p><p>The food in Sydney is an Asian Pacific cuisine. It&#39;s eclectic but above all it&#39;s fresh, inventive and creative and that&#39;s what I love about it.</p><p>We don&#39;t really go in for big family dinners, but Scottish people are famously confrontational. It&#39;s a cultural thing, so maybe we don&#39;t need to have them to clear the air. Also, traditional family food isn&#39;t as nice here so there&#39;s no payoff for traveling hundreds of miles.</p><p>First I would probably place men at the bottom of the food chain. On a grander scale, I would say they&#39;re reacting to change. Feminism has got to be part of that.</p><p>The pride of the hipster food movement is sort of annoying, but it fascinates me.</p><p>I think there&#39;s a lot of work to be done with our societies. My biggest passions are the environment and health. And when I say &#39;health&#39; I mean the secrets behind health and our food system.</p><p>It was very clear to me in 1965, in Mississippi, that, as a lawyer, I could get people into schools, desegregate the schools, but if they were kicked off the plantations - and if they didn&#39;t have food, didn&#39;t have jobs, didn&#39;t have health care, didn&#39;t have the means to exercise those civil rights, we were not going to have success.</p><p>My sisters like cooking at my place. It has a bit more room, and the food tastes a little bit better. A big pot of spaghetti and sauce, some warm French bread - works all the time. I think I&#39;ve been eating pasta for 26 years.</p><p>Meat is a big deal in my life. I do love breakfast food, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s extraordinary. I&#39;m a normal American. We love eggs and meat and potatoes and gravy.</p><p>Just a little help, a small security force, a bit of food, can save lives.</p><p>The world spends $40 billion a year on pet food.</p><p>America is a such a melting pot, I&#39;m not sure if roast chicken is the classic comfort food for everybody.</p><p>There is great food in Vegas.</p><p>I don&#39;t follow the food trends.</p><p>I suppose women are attracted to the bad-boy image sometimes because it&#39;s fun to have an adventure. It&#39;s like eating junk food... it&#39;s fun at the time, but ultimately not the best choice.</p><p>Looking back, there is nothing wrong with that peace, love and equality that the hippies espoused. In many ways, we have regressed because they were into organic food, back to nature, make love not war, be good to all men, share and share alike - which is what many are talking about now.</p><p>Taste as you go.

It&#39;s comfort food for me.</p><p>The simpler the food, the harder it is to prepare it well. You want to truly taste what it is you&#39;re eating.

It&#39;s very Japanese: Preparing good ingredients very simply, without distractions from the flavor of the ingredient itself.</p><p>I am very honored for all the distinctions and accolades, but what I am most sensitive to is my clientele and the fact they are pleased with my food and my restaurants.</p><p>We the chefs have a responsibility to learn about the chemical makeup of food!</p><p>In France today, people no longer eat as much heavy food and fat as they did 15 or 20 years ago. These days, French cooking, through the influence of &#39;grande cuisine,&#39; has become a bit lighter. And we are beginning to discover the original flavors of our produce.</p><p>Taste is developed by the diversity of the products one can sample.

Well, you know there are people who don&#39;t have that problem because they&#39;re not getting any food! We have so many deep problems and issues facing humanity.</p><p>I think that food ties us to our community and our traditions, and it&#39;s the thing that makes us feel good and connected.</p><p>Darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that.
