it.</p><p>The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn, the bird waits in the egg, and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities.</p><p>High achievers spot rich opportunities swiftly, make big decisions quickly and move into action immediately. Follow these principles and you can make your dreams come true.</p><p>How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.</p><p>Never underestimate the power of dreams and the influence of the human spirit. We are all the same in this notion: The potential for greatness lives within each of us.</p><p>You know, my dad served in the President&#39;s Cabinet after his time as a governor. He told me he enjoyed being governor a lot more. Now, I understand why. If I do my job well, I can make a difference in people&#39;s lives and I can help our children realize their dreams.</p><p>When all of your wishes are granted, many of your dreams will be destroyed.</p><p>Help others achieve their dreams and you will achieve yours.</p><p>It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old, they grow old because they stop pursuing dreams.</p><p>In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns, the rattle of musketry, the strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield.</p><p>Anyone who has lost track of time when using a computer knows the propensity to dream, the urge to make dreams come true and the tendency to miss lunch.</p><p>What is a television apparatus to man, who has only to shut his eyes to see the most inaccessible regions of the seen and the never seen, who has only to imagine in order to pierce through walls and cause all the planetary Baghdads of his dreams to rise from the dust.</p><p>Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.</p><p>Our life dreams the Utopia. Our death achieves the Ideal.</p><p>I have dreamed in my life, dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas they have gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the color of my mind.</p><p>Obviously one must hold oneself responsible for the evil impulses of one&#39;s dreams. In what other way can one deal with them? Unless the content of the dream rightly understood is inspired by alien spirits, it is part of my own being.</p><p>Old age realizes the dreams of youth: look at Dean Swift in his youth he built an asylum for the insane, in his old age he was himself an inmate.</p><p>No matter how carefully you plan your goals they will never be more than pipe dreams unless you pursue them with gusto.</p><p>I never ask a man what his business is, for it never interests me. What I ask him about are his thoughts and dreams.</p><p>Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so you shall become. Your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil.</p><p>If you can&#39;t read, it&#39;s going to be hard to realize dreams.</p><p>Follow your dreams, believe in yourself and don&#39;t give up.</p><p>Never let life impede on your ability to manifest your dreams. Dig deeper into your dreams and deeper into yourself and believe that anything is possible, and make it happen.</p><p>I never paint dreams or nightmares. I paint my own reality.</p><p>The life of a man consists not in seeing visions and in dreaming dreams, but in active charity and in willing service.</p><p>You know, the man of my dreams might walk round the corner tomorrow. I&#39;m older and wiser and I think I&#39;d make a great girlfriend. I live in the realm of romantic possibility.</p><p>I am a walking piece of art every day, with my dreams and my ambitions forward at all times in an effort to inspire my fans to lead their life in that way.</p><p>A lot of people do not muster the courage to live their dreams because they are afraid to die.</p><p>You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization.</p><p>We become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams.</p><p>What is life? A madness. What is life? An illusion, a shadow, a story. And the greatest good is little enough for all life is a dream, and dreams themselves are only dreams.</p><p>You have many years ahead of you to create the dreams that we can&#39;t even imagine dreaming. You have done more for the collective unconscious of this planet than you will ever know.</p><p>The success I have achieved in bodybuilding, motion pictures, and business would not have been possible without the generosity of the American people and the freedom here to pursue your dreams.</p><p>It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.</p><p>Ocean is more ancient than the mountains, and freighted with the memories and the dreams of Time.</p><p>Dreams are illustrations... from the book your soul is writing about you.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing as exciting as a comeback - seeing someone with dreams, watching them fail, and then getting a second chance.</p><p>Lose your dreams and you might lose your mind.</p><p>Take, if you must, this little bag of dreams, Unloose the cord, and they will wrap you round.</p><p>It&#39;s insecurity that is always chasing you and standing in the way of your dreams.</p><p>A positive attitude can really make dreams come true - it did for me.</p><p>Mr. Tennyson has said that more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of, but he wisely refrains from saying whether they are good or bad things.</p><p>My own dreams fortunately came true in this great state. I became Mr. Universe I became a successful businessman. And even though some people say I still speak with a slight accent, I have reached the top of the acting profession.</p><p>I&#39;m not just a boy toy. I have feelings and dreams like anybody else.</p><p>The world is seldom what it seems to man, who dimly sees, realities appear as dreams, and dreams realities.</p><p>Most new jobs won&#39;t come from our biggest employers. They will come from our smallest. We&#39;ve got to do everything we can to make entrepreneurial dreams a reality.</p><p>When the legends die, the dreams end there is no more greatness.</p><p>I tell kids to pursue their basketball dreams, but I tell them to not let that be their only dream.</p><p>Flying dreams mean that you&#39;re doing the right thing with your life.</p><p>Common sense tells us that the things of the earth exist only a little, and that true reality is only in dreams.</p><p>My parent&#39;s divorce and hard times at school, all those things combined to mold me, to make me grow up quicker. And it gave me the drive to pursue my dreams that I wouldn&#39;t necessarily have had otherwise.</p><p>It is in our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top.</p><p>The way to kill a man or a nation is to cut off his dreams, the way the whites are taking care of the Indians: killing their dreams, their magic, their familiar spirits.</p><p>But are not the dreams of poets and the tales of travellers notoriously false?</p><p>There are many talented people who haven&#39;t fulfilled their dreams because they over thought it, or they were too cautious, and were unwilling to make the leap of faith.</p><p>An athlete cannot run with money in his pockets. He must run with hope in his heart and dreams in his head.</p><p>The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives and the dreams shall never die.</p><p>I want my boys to have an understanding of people&#39;s emotions, their insecurities, people&#39;s distress, and their hopes and dreams.</p><p>There are a lot of things that are personally uncomfortable to show, especially me without makeup and completely bloated or crying. But I&#39;ve realized that it&#39;s time for me to show my audience that you don&#39;t have to be perfect to achieve your dreams. Because nobody relates to being perfect.</p><p>For all life is a dream, and dreams themselves are only dreams.</p><p>A horse is the projection of peoples&#39; dreams about themselves - strong, powerful, beautiful - and it has the capability of giving us escape from our mundane existence.</p><p>Follow your dreams. Just make sure to have fun too.</p><p>We must look for ways to be an active force in our own lives. We must take charge of our own destinies, design a life of substance and truly begin to live our dreams.</p><p>Lonesome. Lonesome. I know what it means. Here all by my lonesome, dreaming empty dreams. Weary. Weary at the close of day, wondering if tomorrow brings me joy or sorrow.</p><p>To the degree we&#39;re not living our dreams, our comfort zone has more control of us than we have over ourselves.</p><p>Dream small dreams. If you make them too big, you get overwhelmed and you don&#39;t do anything. If you make small goals and accomplish them, it gives you the confidence to go on to higher goals.</p><p>Yet it is in our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top.</p><p>It takes someone with a vision of the possibilities to attain new levels of experience. Someone with the courage to live his dreams.</p><p>Our dreams must be stronger than our memories. We must be pulled by our dreams, rater than pushed by our memories.</p><p>The human heart has hidden treasures, In secret kept, in silence sealed The thoughts, the hopes, the dreams, the pleasures, Whose charms were broken if revealed.</p><p>I can never decide whether my dreams are the result of my thoughts, or my thoughts the result of my dreams.</p><p>A test of what is real is that it is hard and rough. Joys are found in it, not pleasure. What is pleasant belongs to dreams.</p><p>Though we may have desires or bold goals, for whatever reason, most of us don&#39;t think we can achieve something beyond what we&#39;re qualified to achieve. Why, I ask, do we let reality interfere with our dreams?</p><p>Dreams are not without meaning wherever thay may come from-from fantasy, from the elements, or from other inspiration.</p><p>I just write what I wanted to write. I write what amuses me. It&#39;s totally for myself. I never in my wildest dreams expected this popularity.</p><p>All of us gave it all we&#39;ve got, overcame a whole lot just being on the show and learned a lot about ourselves. We&#39;re just normal people trying to do what we love and follow our dreams.</p><p>Freedom and democracy are dreams you never give up.</p><p>My fear is that I go up to the girl of my dreams and say &#39;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;ve got to say hello to you,&#39; and she slides the stool back and gets up and walks away, saying, &#39;Not for me, Bub. I don&#39;t want anything to do with you.&#39;</p><p>People are never more insecure than when they become obsessed with their fears at the expense of their dreams.</p><p>Much can be inferred about a man from his mistress: in her one beholds his weaknesses and his dreams.</p><p>Dreams can become a reality when we possess a vision that is characterized by the willingness to work hard, a desire for excellence, and a belief in our right and our responsiblity to be equal members of society.</p><p>I just kind of wake up with a new idea and new dreams every day, and I follow that dream, as they say.</p><p>I did commit to myself that I would not jump back into being the workaholic that I can be before I gave myself an honest opportunity to create the marriage of my dreams and to create the beginning of the family of my dreams, and that took a hot second.</p><p>We do not really feel grateful toward those who make our dreams come true they ruin our dreams.</p><p>In dreams the truth is learned that all good works are done in the absence of a caress.</p><p>You must recognize, embrace, and be honest about what is real for you today and allow that understanding to inform the choices you make. Only then will you be able to build the future of your dreams.</p><p>I&#39;m aware of the mystery around us, so I write about coincidences, premonitions, emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.</p><p>Dreams are like paper, they tear so easily.</p><p>When we see the face of a child, we think of the future. We think of their dreams about what they might become, and what they might accomplish.</p><p>I don&#39;t design clothes, I design dreams.</p><p>Everybody past a certain age, regardless of how they look on the outside, pretty much constantly dreams of being able to escape from their lives.</p><p>It is one of the blessings of this world that few people see visions and dream dreams.</p><p>Rude contact with facts chased my visions and dreams quickly away, and in their stead I beheld the horrors, the corruption, the evils and hypocrisy of society, and as I stood among them, a young wife, a great wail of agony went out from my soul.</p><p>Stay focused, go after your dreams and keep moving toward your goals.</p><p>To this day, some of my closest friends say, &#39;Gaga, you know, everything&#39;s great. You&#39;re a singer your dreams have come true.&#39; But, still, when certain things are said to you over and over again as you&#39;re growing up, it stays with you and you wonder if they&#39;re true.</p><p>Dreams don&#39;t have deadlines. I&#39;m thinking of doing bigger and better things and having more fun with it.</p><p>To every people the land is given on condition. Perceived or not, there is a Covenant, beyond the constitution, beyond sovereign guarantee, beyond the nation&#39;s sweetest dreams of itself.</p><p>There&#39;s a joy and a pain about directing where the dreams you have are becoming concrete but the attention to detail, the need for time is such that it&#39;s overwhelming at times, and the stream of responsibility.</p><p>Hope lies in dreams, in imagination, and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality.</p><p>Dreams are real as long as they last. Can we say more of life?</p><p>Take pleasure in your dreams relish your principles and drape your purest feelings on the heart of a precious lover.</p><p>To be given the opportunity to help shape new artists&#39; careers and mentor them to see their dreams come to fruition is a task I welcome with open arms.</p><p>I know how men in exile feed on dreams.</p><p>A friend told me that teenage girls are always looking for someone to pin their dreams on. That doesn&#39;t make it any less weird though.</p><p>To all, to each, a fair good-night, and pleasing dreams, and slumbers light.</p><p>A runner must run with dreams in his heart, not money in his pocket.</p><p>I have had dreams and I have had nightmares, but I have conquered my nightmares because of my dreams.</p><p>We should be dreaming. We grew up as kids having dreams, but now we&#39;re too sophisticated as adults, as a nation. We stopped dreaming. We should always have dreams.</p><p>But what I was going to say was, I just figured I&#39;m going to go boldly in the direction of my dreams, say it as Thoreau would say, and just see where it takes me.</p><p>At first, dreams seem impossible, then improbable, and eventually inevitable.</p><p>What is the conservative movement? It&#39;s pretty straightforward. We believe that the way prosperity is created is when people have the freedom and the opportunity to pursue their dreams.</p><p>The follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family, their friends, people who should be supportive going, &#39;What are you talking about?&#39; Even just seemingly regular career paths, but if it&#39;s not what people expect for you they kind of react funny.</p><p>I think when you&#39;re in a relationship where you really care for the other person, when they achieve their dreams it&#39;s better than when you do yourself.</p><p>For even in dreams a good deed is not lost.</p><p>Whatever dreams I have wished have come true.</p><p>No one may speak for the dead, no one may interpret their mutilated dreams and visions.</p><p>I&#39;d definitely be the kind of parent who enabled my child&#39;s dreams. I&#39;d just watch and nurture and guide them. I have the blueprints of what not to do... I think I&#39;d be a good parent, actually.</p><p>Winners, I am convinced, imagine their dreams first. They want it with all their heart and expect it to come true. There is, I believe, no other way to live.</p><p>The real hero is always a hero by mistake he dreams of being an honest coward like everybody else.</p><p>I am so excited to let fans in on how important my relationship with my family is to me. I hope to motivate mothers and daughters to build lifetimes of memories together and inspire kids around the world to live their dreams.</p><p>Do What You Gotta Do&#39; is a positive, inspirational song that says no matter what it is whether you&#39;re up against challenges or trying to get your dreams and aspirations met, you should do what whatever you have to do shy of killing yourself or someone else.;Angie Stone;dreams 15254;A successful life is one that is lived through understanding and pursuing one&#39;s own path, not chasing after the dreams of others.;Chin-Ning Chu;dreams 15255;In our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out.;Tom Hiddleston;dreams 15256;There are a lot of things that are personally uncomfortable to show, especially me without makeup and completely bloated or crying.

Its &#39;product&#39; cannot be turned out on an assembly line.</p><p>I think people tend to see the bigger point, which is maybe not fitting in and feeling like you didn&#39;t have the childhood that you expected you would have, or that you felt lonely or struggled with drugs and alcohol or just that you were able to achieve your dreams.</p><p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be serious, like Daniel Day-Lewis. No one really dreams of being a comic actor, do they? Now I realise how stupid that is - and it&#39;s because comic acting isn&#39;t taken seriously enough. It&#39;s a discipline. You know instantly - either you&#39;re funny and getting the laughs, or you&#39;re not.</p><p>Too many athletes are living in a tiny window. They have no vision for themselves - what they can be outside of football and what they can mean to a community. They just don&#39;t know any better. My hopes and dreams are unlimited.</p><p>The human imagination... has great difficulty in living strictly within the confines of a materialist practice or philosophy. It dreams, like a dog in its basket, of hares in the open.</p><p>I have absurdly vivid dreams.</p><p>I mean, every child at one stage dreams of being a prince or a princess.</p><p>I don&#39;t understand people who dream in black and white. I just don&#39;t get it. My dreams have always been vivid color.</p><p>We have lost that which has made us great over the generations, and that is the sense of individual and personal responsibility that we can come up, we can pursue our dreams and our aspirations and we won&#39;t be blocked by government regulation, by the inability to get a loan as a small business to make our dreams come true.</p><p>Dreams seem to have a will of their own.</p><p>I published in 1978 a report on dreams in the Journal of Clinical Psychology. It was the first study of its kind to demonstrate that it is possible for people to make constructive use of their dreams to improve their lives.</p><p>I think everyone dreams of that nice romantic wedding.</p><p>I was not born in a home where there were stereotypes. So that was very useful because it gave me the sense of possibilities, of flying, if I may say, of making my hopes and dreams a reality.</p><p>I&#39;ve never dreamed of a story idea. I have such boring dreams.</p><p>Our dreams are made of real things, like a shoebox full of photographs.</p><p>I have a notebook that is filled to the brim with my dreams and ideas and goals and aspirations.</p><p>My dreams came true while wearing the opening look from the spring/summer 2010 Dior ready-to-wear collection. I will never forget how special I felt opening John Galliano&#39;s show, like I was living a dream.</p><p>Sometimes your dreams come true.</p><p>Catcher in the Rye had a profound impact on me-the idea that we all have lots of dreams that are slowly being chipped away as we grow up.</p><p>Though I know he loves me, tonight my heart is sad his kiss was not so wonderful as all the dreams I had.</p><p>I am very lucky because I am realizing my childhood dreams, and after presenting my shows it&#39;s like a party.</p><p>That disturbs people when they know they didn&#39;t have the guts or integrity to stick to their dreams.</p><p>My heroes, my dreams, and my future lay in Yankee Stadium. And they can&#39;t take that away from me.</p><p>Every year for New Years I write down all of my goals and dreams and put them in my Bible. At the end of the year I go and pull the paper out and check this off and check that off.</p><p>I only remember the end of my dreams, like waking up at a steering wheel, or falling.</p><p>Talking about food is like talking about your dreams. Everyone has something to say. We all have to eat, it&#39;s just what we eat which differs. Some people eat for fuel and I feel bad for them.</p><p>I tell people, &#39;It&#39;s just like a cliche, but it&#39;s true: In Hollywood, dreams can come true.&#39;</p><p>I married the man of my dreams in 1998.</p><p>But we can hold our spirits and our bodies so pure and high, we may cherish such thoughts and such ideals, and dream such dreams of lofty purpose, that we can determine and know what manner of men we will be, whenever and wherever the hour strikes and calls to noble action.</p><p>I part of this great nation because my grandfather was born here, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He took a horse, back in 1895, and ride it all the way down to Guanajuato, looking for his American dream. No penny in his pocket, only dreams in his head. And he was an immigrant coming from the States into Mexico. And he found his American dream in Mexico.</p><p>We need to be aware of what we are capable of first and realize that if you place your dreams really really high, you do have the potential to get to that level.</p><p>Sports nurtures dreams of achieving self confidence and masculine striving for the skinny kid watching a boxer dance around the ring with sublime ease.</p><p>People&#39;s real hopes and dreams can be distorted and misdirected and packaged until you&#39;re not sure what you really want or what you even really need.</p><p>When I began to choreograph and find my way pulling other artists&#39; dreams out and changing music in a visual way, there was still a part of me that had something more to say. There was still a desire to rock a stage and ultimately perform the eight count of my dream, but there was a lot of insecurity there.</p><p>My work is to reach people with ideas, hopes, dreams, encouragement, insight, and revelation. That&#39;s what an actor wants to do.</p><p>Vision gets the dreams started. Dreaming employs your God-given imagination to reinforce the vision. Both are part of something I believe is absolutely necessary to building the life of a champion, a winner, a person of high character who is consistently at the top of whatever game he or she is in.</p><p>It&#39;s not only imagination, it&#39;s the distortion of the vision. You suddenly think, This person is idealistic, this person is strong, this person has dreams, when you know better most of the time. You put what you want to see on people.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t help but to think back to my classmates at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio. They had the same talent, the same brains, the same dreams as the folks we sat with at Stanford and Harvard. I realized the difference wasn&#39;t one of intelligence or drive. The difference was opportunity.</p><p>To me, what I love about the draft is first, you see the young men who are realizing their dreams that they&#39;ve worked so hard for. That&#39;s a pretty cool thing. You saw the emotion from some of these guys the other day. And then, the second thing is this total sense of hope and optimism. And, I think that&#39;s great for everybody.</p><p>My wife is beginning to instruct me on means to retrieve dreams, and bit by bit, it does seem to be working.</p><p>It was a lovely opportunity for the first time in my whole career to stand up and thank people who are really responsible for me getting to realize my dreams.</p><p>Men are the dreams of a shadow.</p><p>When I was in high school, I don&#39;t know that I really had big dreams.</p><p>I was a great dreamer of day dreams.</p><p>The great function of poetry is to give back to us the situations of our dreams.</p><p>A fulfilling life is different to each person. You have to acknowledge your dreams, and not just wait for life to happen, and opportunities to come knocking at your door.</p><p>It never occurred to me that I&#39;d be on a television show or in feature films but when those came into play my dreams changed along the way.</p><p>I don&#39;t dream songs. I&#39;m more apt to write dreams down and then to be able to interpret them into a song. I also tend to get up and write prose in the morning from which will come songs.</p><p>I had some wonderful dreaming meetings. I can&#39;t tell you specifically what they&#39;ve been in the recent months. In the past they&#39;ve been verbal kinds of messages that he needed to give me. Now they&#39;re more dreams of his presence.</p><p>No, I never had any dreams. The process of art is a dream in itself. The artist just doesn&#39;t... you work out something. It&#39;s yours. You don&#39;t have to go to sleep to do that. You do that on the canvas.</p><p>I heard my name associated with the Peter Pan syndrome more than once. But really, what&#39;s so wrong with Peter Pan? Peter Pan flies. He is a metaphor for dreams and faith.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t prepared to get a mammogram until I was 40 years old, like I&#39;d been told. I never in my wildest dreams expected anything to be wrong.</p><p>I can&#39;t sing but I can understand wanting to keep a balance, trying to pursue dreams, while creating a stable environment for my children.</p><p>All the characters in my books are imagined, but all have a bit of who I am in them - much like the characters in your dreams are all formed by who you are.</p><p>I feel more influenced in my own work by dreams than I do by other writers&#39; works in a way. Or by popular culture, movies - what else is there to write about than love and loss?</p><p>It&#39;s like one of those dreams you have when someone is chasing you. You&#39;re running as fast as you can, and someone&#39;s trotting behind you, just out of range, trying to grab onto you.</p><p>Dreams really tell you about yourself more than anything else in this world could ever tell you.</p><p>Everyone dreams, but not everybody remembers their dreams because some people go into delta they go too low.</p><p>I always knew that we were going to be successful and accomplish and succeed at our dreams. There was never a doubt in my mind. When we were recording &#39;Appetite For Destruction,&#39; we all knew.</p><p>Your mind, while blessed with permanent memory, is cursed with lousy recall. Written goals provide clarity. By documenting your dreams, you must think about the process of achieving them.</p><p>I&#39;ve accomplished a lot, but I still have more dreams that I want to achieve.</p><p>A lot of people put pressure on themselves and think it will be way too hard for them to live out their dreams. Mentors are there to say, &#39;Look, it&#39;s not that tough. It&#39;s not as hard as you think. Here are some guidelines and things I have gone through to get to where I am in my career.&#39;</p><p>I actually build my dreams around the dancers I&#39;ve got in my company.</p><p>No movie influenced me more to go after my dreams than &#39;Flashdance.&#39; After seeing it, I took 15 dance lessons a week. I cut all my sweatshirts. I did the &#39;Maniac&#39; thing.</p><p>My mother was really my partner in every project that I had. She was just the great enabler of my dreams.</p><p>To all the kids out there: Follow your dream. Believe in your dream. Because dreams do come true.</p><p>What&#39;s interesting is, for myself, when I become really attracted to somebody, I find them in my dreams... conversations, nothing more.</p><p>You only get one album. You only get one single. You get one shot in music. But I have a million different dreams. Why can&#39;t I go out and try to achieve them all? Who are you to say I can&#39;t?</p><p>I believe dreams represent the purest form of fantasy we unleash through our subconscious. They represent the truest freedom we can experience. Totally unrepressed and totally creative.</p><p>To provoke dreams of terror in the slumber of prosperity has become the moral duty of literature.</p><p>I&#39;m sure I have a process, but it mostly takes place in my dreams.</p><p>I think I am done with Wikipedia for the time being. But I have a secret hope. Someone recently proposed a Wikimorgue - a bin of broken dreams where all rejects could still be read, as long as they weren&#39;t libelous or otherwise illegal.</p><p>You have to be vigorous. That&#39;s the only way you are going to get it because everybody has dreams and everybody has goals, but the only people who achieve them are the ones that go after it and don&#39;t take no for an answer.</p><p>I think dreams can come true, but not necessarily like fairy-tales. It&#39;s not always so perfect like that.</p><p>The worst thing you can do to a kid is tell them that their dreams are invalid.</p><p>As a kid, this is what I wanted my life to be. Not in my wildest dreams did I ever dare to dream that it would be this.</p><p>I began my career with infantile dreams of becoming a composer.</p><p>The Cut&#39; is going to give someone the opportunity of a lifetime and help that person achieve his or her dreams.;Tommy Hilfiger;dreams 15527;I came at age in the &#39;60s, and initially my hopes and dreams were invested in politics and the movements of the time - the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement.

And yeah, I was almost shocked in the moment that it all came together so nicely.;Roger Federer;dreams 15545;Dream study impacts culture. We are put in touch with the inner poet who dreams.

You apply your dream insights to making constructive changes in your life.;Henry Reed;dreams 15548;People are learning to feel more comfortable hearing one another&#39;s dreams.

Knowingly.</p><p>Moral codes adjust themselves to environmental conditions.</p><p>I&#39;ve used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the United States as effectively as possible. And secondly, I&#39;ve still been able to carry out my commitments to peace and human rights and environmental quality and freedom and democracy and so forth.</p><p>Advertising is an environmental striptease for a world of abundance.</p><p>More and more companies are reaching out to their suppliers and contractors to work jointly on issues of sustainability, environmental responsibility, ethics, and compliance.</p><p>We now see numerous examples of brands working together to address issues such as environmental degradations, climate control, pollution, poverty and disease.</p><p>When people align around shared political, social, economic or environmental values, and take collective action, thinking and behavior that compromises the lives of millions of people around the world can truly change.</p><p>Moreover, the practical recommendations deduced from ecological principles threaten the vested interests of commerce it is hardly surprising that the financial and political power created by these investments should be used sometimes to suppress environmental impact studies.</p><p>Factory farming is one of the biggest contributors to the most serious environmental problems. The meat industry causes more greenhouse gas emissions than all the cars, trucks, planes and ships in the world.</p><p>Economists treat economics as if it is a pure science divorced from the facts of life. The result of this false accountancy is a willful confusion under cover of which industry wreaks its havoc scot-free and ignores the environmental cost.</p><p>In the environmental movement, every time you lose a battle it&#39;s for good, but our victories always seem to be temporary and we keep fighting them over and over again.</p><p>Environmental concern is a little like dieting or paying off credit-card debt - an episodically terrific idea that burns brightly and then seems to fade when we realize there&#39;s a reason we need to diet or pay down our debt. The reason is that it&#39;s really, really hard, and too many of us in too many spheres of life choose the easy over the hard.</p><p>I always thought we had an environmental problem, but I hadn&#39;t realized how urgent it was. James Lovelock writes that by the end of this century there will be one billion people left.</p><p>This is absolutely bizarre that we continue to subsidize highways beyond the gasoline tax, airlines, and we don&#39;t subsidize, we don&#39;t want to subsidize a national rail system that has environmental impact.</p><p>All we can hope for is that the thing is going to slowly and imperceptibly shift. All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.</p><p>I believe we should reframe our response to climate change as an imperative for growth rather than merely being a way of being green or meeting environmental commitments.</p><p>A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.</p><p>My lens of choice was always the 35 mm. It was more environmental. You can&#39;t come in closer with the 35 mm.</p><p>Over and over, we hear politicians say they can&#39;t spend our tax dollars on environmental protection when the economy is so fragile.</p><p>If we want to address global warming, along with the other environmental problems associated with our continued rush to burn our precious fossil fuels as quickly as possible, we must learn to use our resources more wisely, kick our addiction, and quickly start turning to sources of energy that have fewer negative impacts.</p><p>From year to year, environmental changes are incremental and often barely register in our lives, but from evolutionary or geological perspectives, what is happening is explosive change.</p><p>Beyond reducing individual use, one of our top priorities must be to move from fossil fuels to energy that has fewer detrimental effects on water supplies and fewer environmental impacts overall.</p><p>I don&#39;t see this planet being... they&#39;re talking about how they&#39;re turning around the environmental problems here, but I think it&#39;s already too late.</p><p>Nature is not simply a technical or economical resource, and human beings are not mere numbers. To suggest that one can somehow align all the squabbling institutions of science, environmental management, government and diplomacy in an alliance of convenience to regulate the global climate seems to me optimistic.</p><p>I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country&#39;s economic growth, environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.</p><p>In Kenya women are the first victims of environmental degradation, because they are the ones who walk for hours looking for water, who fetch firewood, who provide food for their families.</p><p>We had some major successes and we did so because the country embraced the spirit of Earth Day and embraced this concept that we have to have forward-looking, visionary environmental policy and energy policy in this country.</p><p>Energy and environmental regulation, transportation, and broadband policy all benefit when legislators have a basic grounding in the technical concepts behind business models, products, and innovation.</p><p>Raising awareness on the most pressing environmental issues of our time is more important than ever.</p><p>Toxins love to get you while you&#39;re young. Lead, mercury, secondhand smoke and sundry other environmental nasties do a lot more damage when tissue is immature, vulnerable and growing than when it&#39;s mature and comparatively fixed.</p><p>If China is helping its domestic industries charge an artificially low price for solar panels and other environmental goods, then China is violating international trade rules that it agreed to when it became a member of the World Trade Organization.</p><p>American culture is torn between our long romance with violence and our terror of the devastation wrought by war and crime and environmental havoc.</p><p>Complexity is one of the great problems in environmental design.</p><p>We have fought for social justice. We have fought for economic justice. We have fought for environmental justice. We have fought for criminal justice. Now we must add a new fight - the fight for electoral justice.</p><p>I am going to confront the old-fashioned negative thinking which says that all government needs to do to generate growth is cut worker and environmental protections, cut taxes on the rich and stroke &#39;fat cats&#39; until they purr with pleasure. I&#39;m completely repudiating the idea that government has to get out of the way.</p><p>We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.</p><p>The environmental crisis arises from a fundamental fault: our systems of production - in industry, agriculture, energy and transportation - essential as they are, make people sick and die.</p><p>The most meaningful engine of change, powerful enough to confront corporate power, may be not so much environmental quality, as the economic development and growth associated with the effort to improve it.</p><p>I really believe in the environmental movement right now - it only takes a little effort to make a big difference.</p><p>Americans don&#39;t pay much attention to environmental issues, because they aren&#39;t sexy. I mean, cleaning up coal plants and reining in outlaw frackers is hugely important work, but it doesn&#39;t get anybody&#39;s pulse racing.</p><p>Mark Ruffalo, aka the Incredible Hulk, is the natural gas industry&#39;s worst nightmare: a serious, committed activist who is determined to use his star power as a superhero in the hottest movie of the moment to draw attention the environmental and public health risks of fracking.</p><p>Have we failed to slow global warming pollution in part because climate and environmental activists have been too polite and well behaved?</p><p>In this country, the health concerns and the environmental concerns are as deep as in Europe. All the surveys show that. But here, we didn&#39;t have the cultural dimension. This is a fast-food culture.</p><p>The position I took at the time was that we hadn&#39;t really examined any of the potential environmental consequences of introducing genetically modified organisms.</p><p>The industrial processes in use today were developed at a time when no one had to consider what the environmental impact was. Who cared? But making ecological concerns matter to a company&#39;s bottom line will help it do the research and development that will reinvent everything we buy.</p><p>The most important environmental issue is one that is rarely mentioned, and that is the lack of a conservation ethic in our culture.</p><p>At every turn, when humanity is asked the question, &#39;Do you want temporary economic gain or long-term environmental loss, which one do you prefer,&#39; we invariably choose the money.</p><p>A shift is necessary toward lifestyles less geared to environmental damaging consumption patterns.</p><p>I am on the board of corporations who contribute both to environmental problems and their solutions. And I am on the NGO side: the Earth Council and other organizations.</p><p>I&#39;ve developed a huge regard for Toyota for its environmental awareness, for its immense commitment to research and development in this field, and for its leadership in developing hybrids which others are now following.</p><p>One of the things that I&#39;ve always thought I would like to do is to develop an environmental index. Then people can measure their own environmental performance on an index as they do in other ways.</p><p>Ted Turner is still a leader. And he sets a great example. His ability financially has been reduced, but his influence and his example still is an important asset to the whole environmental movement.</p><p>Why should we not expect self-designated environmental leaders to practice what they preach?</p><p>I&#39;m a latecomer to the environmental issue, which for years seemed to me like an excuse for more government regulation. But I can see that in rich societies, voters are paying less attention to economic issues and more to issues of the spirit, including the environment.</p><p>Civilization has given us enormous successes: going to the moon, technology. But then this is the civilisation that took us to debt, environmental crisis, every single crisis. We need a civilization where we say goodbye to these things.</p><p>To be clear, climate change is a true 800 pound gorilla in the room. The effects of global warming threaten global environmental upheaval over the coming century. But for South Florida and the Everglades, it could be our death knell if urgent action is not taken.</p><p>You cannot achieve environmental security and human development without addressing the basic issues of health and nutrition.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too hippie to want to clean up the planet so you don&#39;t wind up dying of some kind of cancer when you&#39;re 45 years old. It enrages me that these big cancer-research organizations can&#39;t be bothered to man the front lines of environmental protest.</p><p>The environmental benefits of hydrogen are also outstanding. When used as an energy source, hydrogen produces no emissions besides water. Zero polluting emissions, an amazing advance over the current sources of energy that we use.</p><p>Hydrogen holds great promise to meet many of our future energy needs, and it addresses national security and our environmental concerns. Hydrogen is the simplest, most abundant element in the universe.</p><p>By cutting critical domestic programs such as education, health, environmental protection, and veterans&#39; services, this budget reveals misplaced priorities.</p><p>There are nuclear weapons in China, Iran, Korea and Pakistan. It wouldn&#39;t take much to send a couple of warheads off on this planet somewhere that would cause a lot of environmental damage, then if you have got someone who wants to retaliate you have real problems.</p><p>I&#39;d say that animal rights and environmental issues have always been at the forefront of my mind.</p><p>My entry into the environmental arena was through the issue that so dramatically - and destructively - demonstrates the link between science and social action: nuclear weapons.</p><p>In every case, the environmental hazards were made known only by independent scientists, who were often bitterly opposed by the corporations responsible for the hazards.</p><p>By adopting the control strategy, the nation&#39;s environmental program has created a built-in antagonism between environmental quality and economic growth.</p><p>Environmental quality was drastically improved while economic activity grew by the simple expedient of removing lead from gasoline - which prevented it from entering the environment.</p><p>The wave of new productive enterprises would provide opportunities to remedy the unjust distribution of environmental hazards among economic classes and racial and ethnic communities.</p><p>The environmental crisis is a global problem, and only global action will resolve it.</p><p>Environmental pollution is an incurable disease. It can only be prevented.</p><p>What I have experienced over time is that environmental problems are easier to deal with in ways that don&#39;t go into their interconnections to the rest of what we are.</p><p>There is no question that photography has played a major role in the environmental movement.</p><p>These days, most nature photographers are deeply committed to the environmental message.</p><p>I decided that now is the time to start doing the things that really interest me and I find important. It was in the 10 years of the MacArthur grant that I began working on my first book... and I began putting more work into environmental history.</p><p>Federal elections happen every two years in this country. Presidential elections every four years. And four years just isn&#39;t long enough to dismantle all the environmental laws we&#39;ve got in this country.</p><p>New Zealand needs to balance its environmental responsibilities with its economic opportunities, because the risk is that if you don&#39;t do that - and you want to lead the world - then you might end up getting unintended consequences.</p><p>Our work on light bulbs wasn&#39;t an arbitrary mandate. We didn&#39;t just pick a standard out of the air, or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility. Instead, we worked with both industry and environmental groups to come up with a standard that made sense and was doable.</p><p>Without international participation, jobs and emissions will simply shift overseas to countries that require few, if any, environmental protections, harming the global environment as well as the U.S. economy.</p><p>The main environmental challenge of the 21st century is poverty. When you don&#39;t know where your next meal is coming from, it&#39;s hard to consider the environment 100 years down the line.</p><p>In the rich world, the environmental situation has improved dramatically. In the United States, the most important environmental indicator, particulate air pollution, has been cut by more than half since 1955, rivers and coastal waters have dramatically improved, and forests are increasing.</p><p>I think an old style of addressing environmental problems is ebbing, but the rise of the so-called conservative, political movement in this country is not a trend towards the future but a reaction to this very broad shift that we are undergoing.</p><p>Environmental protection doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum. You can&#39;t separate the impact on the environment from the impact on our families and communities.</p><p>Like I said, I&#39;m more worried long term about the environmental issues then the use of arms.</p><p>The Body Shop Foundation is run by our staff and supports social activism and environmental activism. We don&#39;t tend to support big agencies.</p><p>I reflect back 35 years ago, and look how far we have come in America with our environmental policy to improve the conditions of our air and water, and we have had some real successes.</p><p>More than ever before, there is a global understanding that long-term social, economic, and environmental development would be impossible without healthy families, communities, and countries.</p><p>There&#39;s so many issues tied to the meat industry. I mean, social, environmental, humanitarian - all of them. I know that when I&#39;m eating that I&#39;m not hurting the planet, I&#39;m not hurting other people on this planet, I&#39;m not hurting animals... and I&#39;m not hurting nature.</p><p>We all recognize that in recent decades, many important achievements have helped create a cleaner, healthier environment, yet our national needs in environmental health are not being fully met.</p><p>We created the Cabinet Committee on the Environment to review the environmental implications of all government initiatives. I think what made us successful was the fact that it was a sustained approach. We did something new every year.</p><p>If we talk about the environment, for example, we have to talk about environmental racism - about the fact that kids in South Central Los Angeles have a third of the lung capacity of kids in Santa Monica.</p><p>A fascinating challenge facing today&#39;s environmental movement is how to best approach the reversal of past decisions that altered once-pristine environmental spaces for the sake of urgent man-made needs.</p><p>Some types of environmental restoration projects are well-known restored wetlands, for instance, or coal mine reclamation projects. Recently though, larger dam removal projects have started, a number of them in Washington state.</p><p>Unless action is taken soon - unless we can display the same vision of that earlier period - we will lose the treasure of California&#39;s open space and environmental beauty.</p><p>I thought I was gonna be an attorney, so I went to Dartmouth and I was a government major and I minored in environmental policy, and I didn&#39;t do anything academically around the arts.</p><p>And I know that the younger generation is doing things that are so ingenious. And for them it&#39;s not a matter of a political belief or an environmental stance. It&#39;s really just common sense.</p><p>On the environmental front there&#39;s concern about global warming and high levels of carbon dioxide, and trees take in CO2 and store carbon.</p><p>But, as environment minister, I am very interested in a thriving German automobile industry, because I can only pay for the rising costs of environmental protection at home and abroad if there are people in Germany with jobs and who pay taxes.</p><p>Global markets must be balanced by global values such as respect for human rights and international law, democracy, security and sustainable economic and environmental development.</p><p>So to hope to be able to have peace, to be able to have justice and environmental balance, are consequences of our behavior, not just our intentions.</p><p>I wanted to help raise awareness, so I created an environmental foundation called Just Within Reach.</p><p>I think we have grave problems. I am very much concerned about environmental questions, even though in Finnish society, we are not facing the most urgent problems.</p><p>This Nation has realized significant environmental improvements over the last three decades.</p><p>Fracking is doable if there&#39;s full disclosure of all chemicals used. Secondly, science dictates the policy rather than politics. Third, there&#39;s collaboration between environmental groups and the natural gas industry.</p><p>My idea of an amusement park story is getting adventurers to go tour environmental disaster areas. After all, if the entire Great Barrier Reef gets killed, which seems like an extremely lively possibility, what are you going to do with all that rotting limestone?</p><p>Despite Arizona&#39;s remarkable growth in recent years, we have met the current federal health standards for ozone pollution and the Environmental Protection Agency recently approved our dust control plan.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been a strong supporter of environmental protection and initiatives in that area. But I&#39;m willing to set priorities. If we have to make reductions in one place, we&#39;ll have to-in order to increase another place, I&#39;m willing to do that.</p><p>I assume we will have figured out a way to efficiently utilize solar energy and tied that to an efficient way to use nuclear energy in such a way that it doesn&#39;t pose a serious environmental issue.</p><p>During my travels in Iraq, Israel, Gaza, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Europe and all over the United States, I have seen and heard the voices of people who want change. They want the stabilization of the economy, education and healthcare for all, renewable energy and an environmental vision with an eye on generations to come.</p><p>There&#39;s no longer any surprise in noting that China has grave environmental problems.</p><p>Environmental disaster is the gravest threat to China&#39;s continued development. That&#39;s according to me, but it is not some wacko view.</p><p>My efforts in Congress are guided by the belief that environmental preservation and restoration are a critical part of the legacy we leave to future generations.</p><p>Environmental policy must strike a balance between the earth&#39;s best interests and our citizen&#39;s pressing needs.</p><p>But reducing harmful emissions, abating our dependence on foreign oil and developing alternative renewable energy sources have benefits that go beyond environmental health, they improve personal health, enhance national security and encourage our nation&#39;s economic viability.</p><p>All living beings, not just animals, but plants and microorganisms, perceive. To survive, an organic being must perceive - it must seek, or at least recognize, food and avoid environmental danger.</p><p>We have a project with Unocal here in Los Angeles, where we as an environmental organization, the oil company, and the state all get together to promote the recycling of used motor oil.</p><p>We&#39;re not trying to reinvent the wheel for any environmental organization to claim sole responsibility for any kind of victory is insane, because everybody attacks these problems as a group.</p><p>The environmental movement, like all political processes, reacts best to disasters. But these are very slow, very gradual disasters in the making.</p><p>Address these environmental issues and you will address every issue known to man. And we keep dabbling in things that aren&#39;t really that important in the long term.</p><p>Climate change is happening, humans are causing it, and I think this is perhaps the most serious environmental issue facing us.</p><p>I align myself with almost all researchers in assuming that anything we do is a composite of whatever genetic limitations were given to us by our parents and whatever kinds of environmental opportunities are available.</p><p>Cities all over the world are getting bigger as more and more people move from rural to urban sites, but that has created enormous problems with respect to environmental pollution and the general quality of life.</p><p>A variety of factors contribute to the price of gasoline in the United States. These factors include worldwide supply, demand and competition for crude oil, taxes, regional differences in access to gasoline supplies and environmental regulations.</p><p>We should restore a proper balance in environmental regulation and energy production that is based on common sense, not political agendas.</p><p>If there are more and more environmental refugees, they are going to end up on your doorstep too.</p><p>Ethanol is a premier, high performance fuel. It has tremendous environmental benefits and is a key component to energy independence for our country.</p><p>There are a tremendous amount of environmental issues that are on the table.</p><p>And secondly, I would impose a significant state landfill tipping fee and use that tipping fee to fund the billion dollar bond issue that I want to create to produce the funds for all of the environmental challenges that we just went over.</p><p>While the Environmental Genome Project does not seek to assign allele frequencies, we are aware of the importance of accurate allele frequency estimates for future epidemiologic studies and the large sample sizes such estimates will require.</p><p>It is important to consider whether the sample size selected by the Environmental Genome Project will provide sufficient power to discover most alleles relevant to gene-environment interactions.</p><p>One of the responsibilities faced by the Environmental Genome Project is to provide the science base upon which society can make better informed risk management decisions.</p><p>The infrastructure for linking environmental health and public health is not working as well as it should.</p><p>Moreover, environmental health at the local level has become narrowly focused, very much defined around regulations and the attendant regulatory debates.</p><p>Having yet another vote on refinery legislation that uses high oil prices as an excuse to weaken environmental protections and to give more legislative gifts to the oil industry is misguided in the extreme.</p><p>Let me start by emphasizing that I am open to efforts to expedite environmental procedures for true emergencies or in other clear cases where current laws are needlessly burdensome.</p><p>Well, for starters, we have to do more to create demand for new technologies that can reduce our dependence on foreign oil and environmental degradation.</p><p>Practically every environmental problem we have can be traced to our addiction to fossil fuels, primarily oil.</p><p>Of the 55 refineries closed in America in the last 10 years, they were all closed for economic reasons, mostly oil company mergers. Not a single one was closed for environmental purposes or objections.</p><p>At Current, television is all we do - that&#39;s our business. We don&#39;t have amusement parks I have to worry about, we don&#39;t have environmental cases against us, we don&#39;t have a series of outdoor-advertising companies.</p><p>It is extremely important to me that the social and environmental issues associated with the production of fashion clothing are addressed.</p><p>I tell my environmental friends that they have won. Every issue we look at from an energy perspective is now also looked at from an environmental perspective.</p><p>It is one of the issues that will have to be worked through however let me make the point and I think anyone would accept that if you set it up properly, not only will you get better environmental outcomes, you have a chance to create more wealth with the available resource.</p><p>But my point is that you design something in the end that precludes any unhealthy trading practices that are not going to serve your environmental or your economic objectives but now is not the time to do it.</p><p>I think it makes people in the Pentagon kind of nervous to know that chemical agents and environmental factors could cause so much damage in terms of what may happen in the future.</p><p>There is no &#39;need&#39; for us to eat meat, dairy or eggs. Indeed, these foods are increasingly linked to various human diseases and animal agriculture is an environmental disaster for the planet.</p><p>There are more effective ways of tackling environmental problems including global warming, proliferation of plastics, urban sprawl, and the loss of biodiversity than by treaties, top-down regulations, and other approaches offered by big governments and their dependents.</p><p>No one does a better, cleaner, or environmental friendlier, than the United States, when it comes to drilling for oil, gas, coal, oil refineries and fish friendly hydroelectric.</p><p>I hope that in future Congresses there will reemerge a recognition that climate change is a reality, that our policies to meet our energy needs must also deal responsibly with environmental issues, including the damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Time after time we&#39;re told corporations should have freedom from pesky job safety regulations, environmental protections and labor standards - giving working people the freedom to be crushed in collapsing mines, choke on filthy air and get paid too little to live on.</p><p>Furthermore, both Pennsylvania and New Jersey Departments of Environmental Protection have evaluated the sediment to be dredged and also found it to be not toxic.</p><p>In the state of Wisconsin it&#39;s mandated that teachers in the social sciences and hard sciences have to start giving environmental education by the first grade, through high school.</p><p>Franklin Roosevelt was very concerned about environmental issues.</p><p>Loads of chemicals and hazardous wastes have been introduced into the atmosphere that didn&#39;t even exist in 1948. The environmental condition of the planet is far worse than it was 42 years ago.</p><p>I like the outdoors and the natural world. Environmental issues.</p><p>There has been a banking crisis, a financial crisis, an economic crisis, a social crisis, a geostrategic crisis and an environmental crisis. That&#39;s considerable in a country that&#39;s used to being protected.</p><p>Public discourse has been polluted now for decades by corporate-funded disinformation - not just with climate change but with a host of health, environmental and societal threats. The implications for the planet are grim.</p><p>Since the day he came into office, President Bush has worked to gut more than 34 years of hard work by weakening many of our Nation&#39;s standing environmental laws, some of which were signed into law by his father.</p><p>This Bush administration has a growing credibility gap, maybe even a credibility chasm, on environmental policy. The President has lost the trust of the American people when it comes to the environment.</p><p>It is the greatest scam in history. I am amazed, appalled and highly offended by it. Global Warming It is a scam. Some dastardly scientists with environmental and political motives manipulated long term scientific data to create an illusion of rapid global warming.</p><p>There should be more attention paid to scientific research in the ecology area, and I think that such attention to proper environmental concerns would make the public feel much better about it.</p><p>Just as there&#39;s garbage that pollutes the Potomac river, there is garbage polluting our culture. We need an Environmental Protection Agency to clean it up.</p><p>Architects in the past have tended to concentrate their attention on the building as a static object. I believe dynamics are more important: the dynamics of people, their interaction with spaces and environmental condition.</p><p>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.</p><p>Before God we are all equally wise - and equally foolish.</p><p>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood.</p><p>The sweltering summer of the Negro&#39;s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality.</p><p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p><p>These men ask for just the same thing, fairness, and fairness only. This, so far as in my power, they, and all others, shall have.</p><p>I believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers.</p><p>If liberty and equality, as is thought by some, are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be best attained when all persons alike share in government to the utmost.</p><p>Coming generations will learn equality from poverty, and love from woes.</p><p>All this talk about equality. The only thing people really have in common is that they are all going to die.</p><p>We will never have true civilization until we have learned to recognize the rights of others.</p><p>I am free of all prejudices. I hate every one equally.</p><p>I know my country has not perfected itself. At times, we&#39;ve struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people. We&#39;ve made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions.</p><p>Equality, rightly understood as our founding fathers understood it, leads to liberty and to the emancipation of creative differences wrongly understood, as it has been so tragically in our time, it leads first to conformity and then to despotism.</p><p>In America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors, for, from the time of Jefferson onward, the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards, not downwards.</p><p>If any man claims the Negro should be content... let him say he would willingly change the color of his skin and go to live in the Negro section of a large city. Then and only then has he a right to such a claim.</p><p>Racism is still with us. But it is up to us to prepare our children for what they have to meet, and, hopefully, we shall overcome.</p><p>Equality may perhaps be a right, but no power on earth can ever turn it into a fact.</p><p>The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality.</p><p>From the equality of rights springs identity of our highest interests you cannot subvert your neighbor&#39;s rights without striking a dangerous blow at your own.</p><p>The battle for women&#39;s rights has been largely won.</p><p>All the people like us are we, and everyone else is They.</p><p>A woman who thinks she is intelligent demands the same rights as man. An intelligent woman gives up.</p><p>All men are created equal, it is only men themselves who place themselves above equality.</p><p>Equality is the soul of liberty there is, in fact, no liberty without it.</p><p>To be successful, a woman has to be much better at her job than a man.</p><p>I am totally against the idea that a Muslim woman should not have the same opportunities as a Muslim man to learn, to open up, to work, help shape the future. To close Islam down to a sexist approach is totally intolerable and ridiculous. It&#39;s not Islam.</p><p>The year was 2081, and everyone was finally equal.</p><p>There can be no equality or opportunity if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they cannot alter, control, or singly cope with.</p><p>As equality increases, so does the number of people struggling for predominance.</p><p>It is better that some should be unhappy rather than that none should be happy, which would be the case in a general state of equality.</p><p>In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way.

You are able to say to yourself, &#39;I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.</p><p>Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.</p><p>Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.</p><p>The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.</p><p>Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.</p><p>Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude.</p><p>It was the experience of mystery - even if mixed with fear - that engendered religion.</p><p>Experience demands that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the general prey of the rich on the poor.</p><p>Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.</p><p>The more connections you and your lover make, not just between your bodies, but between your minds, your hearts, and your souls, the more you will strengthen the fabric of your relationship, and the more real moments you will experience together.</p><p>I believe that anyone can conquer fear by doing the things he fears to do, provided he keeps doing them until he gets a record of successful experience behind him.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive.</p><p>Like success, failure is many things to many people. With Positive Mental Attitude, failure is a learning experience, a rung on the ladder, a plateau at which to get your thoughts in order and prepare to try again.</p><p>If money is your hope for independence you will never have it. The only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability.</p><p>Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy. Human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives.</p><p>The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome. The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse.</p><p>Many people know so little about what is beyond their short range of experience. They look within themselves - and find nothing! Therefore they conclude that there is nothing outside themselves either.</p><p>Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another.</p><p>I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too!</p><p>Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.</p><p>If history repeats itself, and the unexpected always happens, how incapable must Man be of learning from experience.</p><p>Experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession.</p><p>My experience has been that work is almost the best way to pull oneself out of the depths.</p><p>Unwearied ceaseless effort is the price that must be paid for turning faith into a rich infallible experience.</p><p>Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.</p><p>I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge.

And I believe that love is stronger than death.</p><p>I am a woman in process. I&#39;m just trying like everybody else. I try to take every conflict, every experience, and learn from it. Life is never dull.</p><p>Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.</p><p>Fame will go by and, so long, I&#39;ve had you, fame. If it goes by, I&#39;ve always known it was fickle. So at least it&#39;s something I experience, but that&#39;s not where I live.</p><p>We choose our joys and sorrows long before we experience them.</p><p>There are three methods to gaining wisdom. The first is reflection, which is the highest. The second is limitation, which is the easiest. The third is experience, which is the bitterest.</p><p>I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who, by all laws of logic, should never have made it. At each stage of my career, I lacked the experience.</p><p>Sex without love is a meaningless experience, but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good.</p><p>A lot of people in our industry haven&#39;t had very diverse experiences. So they don&#39;t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one&#39;s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.</p><p>It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.</p><p>The wise are instructed by reason, average minds by experience, the stupid by necessity and the brute by instinct.</p><p>Experience, as a desire for experience, does not come off. We must not study ourselves while having an experience.</p><p>To use the same words is not a sufficient guarantee of understanding one must use the same words for the same genus of inward experience ultimately one must have one&#39;s experiences in common.</p><p>Experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger portion of the truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant.</p><p>Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.</p><p>What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea. It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience, something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else.</p><p>I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.</p><p>Genius is the ability to renew one&#39;s emotions in daily experience.</p><p>Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life&#39;s deepest joy: true fulfillment.</p><p>We should not look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors, and for the purpose of profiting by dearly bought experience.</p><p>Take time to gather up the past so that you will be able to draw from your experience and invest them in the future.</p><p>Experience taught me a few things. One is to listen to your gut, no matter how good something sounds on paper. The second is that you&#39;re generally better off sticking with what you know. And the third is that sometimes your best investments are the ones you don&#39;t make.</p><p>We learn from experience that men never learn anything from experience.</p><p>I don&#39;t have to have faith, I have experience.</p><p>Men are wise in proportion, not to their experience, but to their capacity for experience.</p><p>There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate, upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.</p><p>A failure is a man who has blundered, but is not able to cash in the experience.</p><p>And so you touch this limit, something happens and you suddenly can go a little bit further. With your mind power, your determination, your instinct, and the experience as well, you can fly very high.</p><p>Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.</p><p>Is there anyone so wise as to learn by the experience of others?</p><p>Our DNA is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who&#39;s voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That&#39;s who we think about. And we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience. And if it&#39;s not up to par, it&#39;s our fault, plain and simply.</p><p>Sleep - the most beautiful experience in life - except drink.</p><p>The joy of life consists in the exercise of one&#39;s energies, continual growth, constant change, the enjoyment of every new experience. To stop means simply to die. The eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal.</p><p>I have found little that is &#39;good&#39; about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something that you cannot say aloud, or perhaps even think.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn&#39;t be ours anymore.</p><p>Take control of your consistent emotions and begin to consciously and deliberately reshape your daily experience of life.</p><p>Enlightened leadership is spiritual if we understand spirituality not as some kind of religious dogma or ideology but as the domain of awareness where we experience values like truth, goodness, beauty, love and compassion, and also intuition, creativity, insight and focused attention.</p><p>One of the greatest moments in anybody&#39;s developing experience is when he no longer tries to hide from himself but determines to get acquainted with himself as he really is.</p><p>You learn from a conglomeration of the incredible past - whatever experience gotten in any way whatsoever.</p><p>Gratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday epiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how we experience life and the world.</p><p>The only real security that a man can have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience and ability.</p><p>You have people come into your life shockingly and surprisingly. You have losses that you never thought you&#39;d experience. You have rejection and you have learn how to deal with that and how to get up the next day and go on with it.</p><p>I&#39;d rather have a lot of talent and a little experience than a lot of experience and a little talent.</p><p>All growth is a leap in the dark, a spontaneous unpremeditated act without benefit of experience.</p><p>The best scientist is open to experience and begins with romance - the idea that anything is possible.</p><p>DOS is ugly and interferes with users&#39; experience.</p><p>Freedom. Freedom of religion. Freedom to speak their mind. Freedom to build a life. And yes, freedom to build a business. With their own hands. This is the essence of the American experience.</p><p>Lying in bed would be an altogether perfect and supreme experience if only one had a colored pencil long enough to draw on the ceiling.</p><p>Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present.</p><p>It&#39;s an interesting combination: Having a great fear of being alone, and having a desperate need for solitude and the solitary experience. That&#39;s always been a tug of war for me.</p><p>It&#39;s good to experience Hollywood in short bursts, I guess. Little snippets. I don&#39;t think I can handle being here all the time, it&#39;s pretty nutty.</p><p>Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity.</p><p>The historical experience of socialist countries has sadly demonstrated that collectivism does not do away with alienation but rather increases it, adding to it a lack of basic necessities and economic inefficiency.</p><p>Love is an emotion that is based on an opinion of women that is impossible for those who have had any experience with them.</p><p>Women always excel men in that sort of wisdom which comes from experience. To be a woman is in itself a terrible experience.</p><p>Ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society.</p><p>Surely all art is the result of one&#39;s having been in danger, of having gone through an experience all the way to the end, where no one can go any further.</p><p>Every experience is a paradox in that it means to be absolute, and yet is relative in that it somehow always goes beyond itself and yet never escapes itself.</p><p>If you wish to succeed in life, make perseverance your bosom friend, experience your wise counselor, caution your elder brother, and hope your guardian genius.</p><p>Although nature commences with reason and ends in experience it is necessary for us to do the opposite, that is to commence with experience and from this to proceed to investigate the reason.</p><p>I know it&#39;s an experience that I need to have if God&#39;s putting me through it.</p><p>In the business world, everyone is paid in two coins: cash and experience. Take the experience first the cash will come later.</p><p>If merely &#39;feeling good&#39; could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience.</p><p>You are not a human being in search of a spiritual experience. You are a spiritual being immersed in a human experience.</p><p>How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god.</p><p>If you want to run, run a mile.

I think that it puts you in your place because it really forces you to address the issues that you claim to believe in and if you can&#39;t stand up to those principles when you&#39;re raising a child, forget it.</p><p>There should be a sympathy with freedom, a desire to give it scope, founded not upon visionary ideas, but upon the long experience of many generations within the shores of this happy isle, that in freedom you lay the firmest foundations both of loyalty and order.</p><p>Poets are the only people to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable experience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one.</p><p>In George Bush you get experience, and with me you get - The Future!</p><p>In those days a concert was a personal experience. I wanted to be as close as possible to the audience, and of course big stadiums didn&#39;t enable you to do that. It wasn&#39;t my style.</p><p>Any film, or to me any creative endeavour, no matter who you&#39;re working with, is, in many cases, a wonderful experience.</p><p>Very often I&#39;ve known people who wouldn&#39;t say a word to each other, but they&#39;d go to see movies together and experience life that way.</p><p>Working with HBO was an opportunity to experience creative freedom and &#39;long-form development&#39; that filmmakers didn&#39;t have a chance to do before the emergence of shows like &#39;The Sopranos.&#39;</p><p>Women love working together. That&#39;s my experience anyway.</p><p>The amount of meetings I&#39;ve been in - people would be shocked. But that&#39;s how you gain experience, how you can gain knowledge, being in meetings and participating. You learn and grow.</p><p>Surfing soothes me, it&#39;s always been a kind of Zen experience for me. The ocean is so magnificent, peaceful, and awesome. The rest of the world disappears for me when I&#39;m on a wave.</p><p>We are increasingly likely to find ourselves in places with background music. No composers have thought to write for these modern spaces, which represent 30% of our musical experience.</p><p>Sometimes you recognize that there is a category of human experience that has not been identified but everyone knows about it. That is when I find a term to describe it.</p><p>But inner experience is only one source of human knowledge.</p><p>Our wisdom comes from our experience, and our experience comes from our foolishness.</p><p>We can not continue to allow this over reliance on government to replace the cornerstone institution that has made the American experience possible.</p><p>There are pros and cons of experience. A con is that you can&#39;t look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes and as objectively as if you were a new CEO. Fire yourself on a Friday night and come in on Monday morning as if a search firm put you there as a turn-around leader. Can you be objective and make the bold change?</p><p>It is very easy to make clear what you want a film to say, but I did not wish to engage in overt propaganda, even for the right cause. I wanted to create an experience through the films, something where people could have the freedom of their own response to them.</p><p>I would love to work in America. I wouldn&#39;t love to live there, but I&#39;d love to experience working there.</p><p>I had one relative who passed away but fortunately none others. So my sort of experience of it is quite limited, thankfully.</p><p>I have such happy memories of performing in a choir and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have got where I am today without all that experience. So my advice to young singers is to either join your school or church&#39;s choir or find one in your local area. Choral music at any level teaches you so much about musicianship and blending your voice.</p><p>As the leader of twelve apostles, even Jesus had more executive experience than Obama.</p><p>Values are principles and ideas that bring meaning to the seemingly mundane experience of life. A meaningful life that ultimately brings happiness and pride requires you to respond to temptations as well as challenges with honor, dignity, and courage.</p><p>If we didn&#39;t want to upset anyone, we would make films about sewing, but even that could be dangerous. But I think finally, in a film, it is how the balance is and the feelings are. But I think there has to be those contrasts and strong things within a film for the total experience.</p><p>All I know is that history repeats itself and people are going to want to experience the world. But I know then they are going to have a better appreciation for what is here in Maine.</p><p>The simple act of saying &#39;thank you&#39; is a demonstration of gratitude in response to an experience that was meaningful to a customer or citizen.</p><p>I was so emotional. Choked up. I could hardly talk all day. I&#39;ll be cleaning out my trailer and saying goodbye soon, realizing what a wonderful experience this has been.</p><p>Experience has taught me how important it is to just keep going, focusing on running fast and relaxed. Eventually it passes and the flow returns. It&#39;s part of racing.</p><p>People of art should never get married and have children, because it&#39;s a selfish experience.</p><p>If you will call your troubles experiences, and remember that every experience develops some latent force within you, you will grow vigorous and happy, however adverse your circumstances may seem to be.</p><p>You are about to have your first experience with a Greek lunch. I will kill you if you pretend to like it.</p><p>Before people complain of the obscurity of modern poetry, they should first examine their consciences and ask themselves with how many people and on how many occasions they have genuinely and profoundly shared some experience with another.</p><p>The character and history of each child may be a new and poetic experience to the parent, if he will let it.</p><p>I grew up like a neglected weed - ignorant of liberty, having no experience of it.</p><p>I would wish for any one of my colleagues to have the experience of working with Martin Scorsese once in their lifetime.</p><p>It&#39;s my experience that you really can&#39;t lose when you try the truth.</p><p>How do people relate to movies now, when they&#39;re on portable devices or streaming them? It&#39;s not as much about going to the movies. That experience has changed.</p><p>I had no expectations about fatherhood, really, but it&#39;s definitely a journey I&#39;m glad to be taking. Number one, it&#39;s a great learning experience. When my mother told me it&#39;s a 24/7 job, she wasn&#39;t kidding.</p><p>Going to a party, for me, is as much a learning experience as, you know, sitting in a lecture.</p><p>In our society, daily experience teaches the individual to want and need a never-ending supply of new toys and drugs.</p><p>A moment&#39;s insight is sometimes worth a life&#39;s experience.</p><p>If someone is making a judgment when they don&#39;t have firsthand experience, it&#39;s intolerant. How can you make a judgment on something you don&#39;t know about?</p><p>What is sure is that technological change is accelerating in all directions and, like children playing in a fountain, consumers are reveling in the experience.</p><p>Corporate America cannot afford to remain silent or passive about the downward spiral we are undergoing. It cannot turn a blind eye to how difficult the experience of life is for so many of their customers.</p><p>Ultimately, it&#39;s possible that social media platforms will be designed as templates that the users themselves customize in terms of the best way to express their community and experience of life, and brands will have to simply follow suit.</p><p>How much do you as a consumer value a positive experience with a brand or its customer service department? How willing are you to share that with your friends? How inclined are you to let that person know that you&#39;re interaction with them was positive?</p><p>Never, for the sake of peace and quiet, deny your own experience or convictions.</p><p>I&#39;ve learned through experience that life is never that bad. The secret is just paying attention to how you feel and not letting anyone else dictate what in your heart you know is right.</p><p>Ends and purposes, whether they exist as conscious or subconscious tendencies, form the wrap and woof of our conscious experience.</p><p>The immediacy of mystic experience simply means that we know God just as we know other objects. God is not a mathematical entity or a system of concepts mutually related to one another and having no reference to experience.</p><p>I go by instinct - I don&#39;t worry about experience.</p><p>In my experience lust only ever leads to misery. All that suspicion and jealousy and anguish it unleashes. I don&#39;t want those things in my life.</p><p>Every experience makes you a man.</p><p>I&#39;ve been playing against older and stronger competition my whole life. It has made me a better tennis player and able to play against this kind of level despite their strength and experience.</p><p>It took me years to understand that words are often as important as experience, because words make experience last.</p><p>Observation more than books and experience more than persons, are the prime educators.</p><p>The more you are getting older, you lose a little something. Of course there is another advantage, because of your long experience you can use it.</p><p>Reasoning draws a conclusion, but does not make the conclusion certain, unless the mind discovers it by the path of experience.</p><p>Proverbs are short sentences drawn from long experience.</p><p>Both expectations and memories are more than mere images founded on previous experience.</p><p>We are volcanoes. When we women offer our experience as our truth, as human truth, all the maps change. There are new mountains.</p><p>That&#39;s not to say that women&#39;s priorities are better than men&#39;s. Rather, when women are empowered, when they can speak from the experience of their own lives, they often address different, previously neglected issues. And families and whole communities benefit.</p><p>Mississippi Mermaid was a very special experience because we only had the dialogues for the scenes we were shooting the night before.</p><p>I don&#39;t think I even knew how big we were at the time. It was mad. I gained a lot through East 17 and I&#39;m grateful for being able to have that experience.</p><p>I loved the material when I first read it, and the experience of making the film was a great one. So when we came around to complete the trilogy, I just signed on board without even reading the scripts because the experience of the first film was so good.</p><p>I mean, if you didn&#39;t get it or if you didn&#39;t feel like you enjoyed it, sometimes that experience can change.</p><p>You may never learn the names of any of the people you talk to in a dog park, even after many, many hours spent there with them, and many hours of conversation. But if - knock on wood - anything should ever happen to your dog, these nameless non-strangers will rally, sympathize, offer to help, and hold your hand. I know this from experience.</p><p>Living in a rural setting exposes you to so many marvelous things - the natural world and the particular texture of small-town life, and the exhilarating experience of open space.</p><p>Parents, it seems, have an almost Olympian persistence when it comes to suggesting more secure and lucrative lines of work for their children who have the notion that writing is an actual profession. I say this from experience.</p><p>Buying a car used to be an experience so soul-scorching, so confidence-splattering, so existentially rattling that an entire car company was based on the promise that you wouldn&#39;t have to come in contact with it.</p><p>Sometimes I get so bold and I&#39;m so confident about what I&#39;m doing that I actually try to be more of a dork because it&#39;s a really liberating feeling to experience what it&#39;s like to not care.</p><p>We experience problem-solving sessions as war zones, we view competing ideas as enemies, and we use problems as weapons to blame and defeat opposition forces. No wonder we can&#39;t come up with real lasting solutions!</p><p>I think each movie-making process is a very exhausting and satisfying and fulfilling experience for me.</p><p>I&#39;m not a romantic. In life I didn&#39;t have much experience with romance.</p><p>So when you do your family tree and Margaret Cho does hers, and... Wanda Sykes and John Legend... we&#39;re adding to the database that scholars can then draw from to generalize about the complexity of the American experience. And that&#39;s the contribution that family trees make to broader scholarship.</p><p>I can only speak from my own personal experience, being behind the camera and in front of it, but every magazine cover you see is completely airbrushed.</p><p>To most men experience is like the stern lights of a ship, which illuminate only the track it has passed.</p><p>As for the forces, electromagnetism and gravity we experience in everyday life. But the weak and strong forces are beyond our ordinary experience. So in physics, lots of the basic building blocks take 20th- or perhaps 21st-century equipment to explore.</p><p>Bad experience is a school that only fools keep going to.</p><p>No 27-year-old has the experience to run a company that does a quarter of a billion dollars a year in sales.</p><p>Breathe-in experience, breathe-out poetry.</p><p>Another way of judging the value of a prophet&#39;s religious experience, therefore, would be to examine the type of manhood that he has created, and the cultural world that has sprung out of the spirit of his message.</p><p>The possibility of a scientific treatment of history means a wider experience, a greater maturity of practical reason, and finally a fuller realization of certain basic ideas regarding the nature of life and time.</p><p>It&#39;s more fun to experience things when you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen.</p><p>Can advertising foist an inferior product on the consumer? Bitter experience has taught me that it cannot. On those rare occasions when I have advertised products which consumer tests have found inferior to other products in the same field, the results have been disastrous.</p><p>In my experience, it is rarer to find a really happy person in a circle of millionaires than among vagabonds.</p><p>Sometimes when we weep in the movies we weep for ourselves or for a life unlived. Or we even go to the movies because we want to resist the emotion that&#39;s there in front of us. I think there is always a catharsis that I look for and that makes the movie experience worthwhile.</p><p>There are such beings as vampires, some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples.</p><p>If you sit in a position where decisions that you take would have a serious effect on people, you can&#39;t ignore a lot of experience around the world which says this drug has these negative effects.</p><p>I think any spiritual experience that&#39;s worthwhile is not about ego and it will humble you in some way. And also, a Zen monk once said to me, &#39;If you&#39;re not laughing, then you&#39;re not getting it.&#39;</p><p>The position that I take partly as a result of living in Asia is where you stop living according to your expectations and you become available to experience things as they are.</p><p>Truly charismatic people, in my experience, don&#39;t come along very often.</p><p>The wonderful thing about acting is you move along with your decade. The older you get, the more interesting the parts you get to play and you bring more of your personal experience to the part.</p><p>Everyone will experience the consequences of his own acts. If his act are right, he&#39;ll get good consequences if they&#39;re not, he&#39;ll suffer for it.</p><p>Going to the theater is such a joyous experience. My dad would take my sister and me to plays when we were very young, like six or seven years old.</p><p>The soul is everlasting, and its learning experience is lifetime after lifetime.</p><p>When a child comes in, I believe that it&#39;s a &#39;multipersonhood,&#39; and it knows it, its consciousness knows it, and it has a nuclei in the center of its consciousness that is the repository of all experience and all knowledge. And when you look in the eyes of your baby and you feel this sense that they are an old soul, I believe indeed they are.</p><p>Well, I think the main message is there is more to your story. There is more than what happens between the crib and the grave, and that is what I am really trying to speak to, this idea that all of life is this life and that there is nothing more than what we see and experience right here on this earth.</p><p>The biggest danger to the European Union comes not from those who advocate change, but from those who denounce new thinking as heresy. In its long history Europe has experience of heretics who turned out to have a point.</p><p>I&#39;m not trying to be romantic. I think you can tell when people are trying to be sexy onstage. When I was doing &#39;All the Way,&#39; I was really thinking about my wife. People don&#39;t know my personal experience, but they can tell it&#39;s an honest interpretation.</p><p>While teaching, I also worked undercover in the lower courts by saying I was a young law teacher wanting experience in criminal law. The judges were happy to assist me but what I learned was how corrupt the lower courts were. Judges were accepting money right in the courtroom.</p><p>I believe there&#39;s no proverb but what is true they are all so many sentences and maxims drawn from experience, the universal mother of sciences.</p><p>Loneliness is and always has been the central and inevitable experience of every man.</p><p>The deeper the experience of an absence of meaning - in other words, of absurdity - the more energetically meaning is sought.</p><p>The human face is the organic seat of beauty. It is the register of value in development, a record of Experience, whose legitimate office is to perfect the life, a legible language to those who will study it, of the majestic mistress, the soul.</p><p>I did a play called Throne of Straw when I was 11, at the Odyssey Theatre in Los Angeles. It became really clear to me at that point that I enjoyed acting more than any other experience I was having.</p><p>You can&#39;t leave out half the world&#39;s experience and expect to address all the problems. Women communicate differently and process information differently, which leads them to resolve conflicts differently.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with acknowledging the panoply of life&#39;s rich experience.</p><p>When fish experience something that would cause other animals physical pain, they behave in ways suggestive of pain, and the change in behaviour may last several hours.</p><p>Experience is what you get while looking for something else.</p><p>I&#39;ve had to come to grips with a God that fits my own experience, which is, my God could not be offering protection and not have protected my boy.</p><p>From my experience, I think that every actor has to make sure that they&#39;re in charge of their own career somehow or other.</p><p>I am the the type to have a personal experience with a celebrity, but I&#39;m too classy to bring that up.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been attracted to cars, and driving is a completely measurable experience: if you qualify last on the grid, you&#39;re the slowest, and if you qualify first on the grid, you&#39;re the fastest. So no one can say you&#39;re slow if you&#39;re fast and no one can say you&#39;re fast if you&#39;re slow.</p><p>When I look back at the tapes, your first everything, your first All-Star Game, your first playoff experience, it just seems like it went by really fast.</p><p>Judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement.</p><p>My image had always been very heterosexual, very straight. So it was a nice experience for me, a chance to clarify my own feelings about gay and lesbian civil rights.</p><p>Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.</p><p>I very rarely came across rude or disrespectful people. I don&#39;t know how I slipped by all of them, but I honestly can&#39;t think of one experience off the top of my head that was like that. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re there, but I&#39;d have to think really hard to recall them.</p><p>Yet higher religion, which is only a search for a larger life, is essentially experience and recognized the necessity of experience as its foundation long before science learnt to do so.</p><p>It may, however, be said that the level of experience to which concepts are inapplicable cannot yield any knowledge of a universal character, for concepts alone are capable of being socialized.</p><p>The standpoint of the man who relies on religious experience for capturing Reality must always remain individual and incommunicable.</p><p>An enormous part of our mature experience cannot not be expressed in words.</p><p>When I was 12 years old, someone took me to see Martha Graham. It was nothing like what I thought of as serious dancing and even then I knew I was having a great experience. It was as if somebody was moving through space like no one ever did before.</p><p>For some young people, their first experience ever hearing punk rock music was playing the Green Bay Packers on &#39;Madden&#39;.</p><p>I have a theory that the best ads come from personal experience. Some of the good ones I have done have really come out of the real experience of my life, and somehow this has come over as true and valid and persuasive.</p><p>Many spiritual teachers - in Buddhism, in Islam - have talked about first-hand experience of the world as an important part of the path to wisdom, to enlightenment.</p><p>I&#39;ve been looking to do TV for a while. I&#39;ve always done guest starring stuff. I&#39;ve done a couple of multi-episode arcs, and I&#39;ve always loved the experience.</p><p>More people should read books. It&#39;s the most concentrated experience you can have.</p><p>The first essential in writing about anything is that the writer should have no experience of the matter.</p><p>I hate it when people don&#39;t recognize the work of women as being universal, or having any import to the world at large, as opposed to men&#39;s work, which is generally tends to be seen as more universal - men&#39;s writing about their own experience tends to be put in a broader context.</p><p>I had the experience last year of directing my first feature while I had a 1-year-old son and while I was also pregnant, so I am now well aware of the difficulties women who are rearing children face when they&#39;re also trying to make headway in mainstream of film.</p><p>You know, it shouldn&#39;t just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things, it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles, telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman&#39;s perspective. I hope, someday, we can get to that point. I&#39;m all about representation.</p><p>There&#39;s probably no experience more alienating than fame, other than a terminal illness, where you actually find yourself in a situation that nobody around you can relate to.</p><p>One nice thing about being a woman in Hollywood is that the women tend to be very close-knit. All of us writers and directors know each other and cling to each other for safety and support, and it&#39;s really a completely different vibe than the men experience out here, where they&#39;re all trying to murder each other.</p><p>History and experience tell us that moral progress comes not in comfortable and complacent times, but out of trial and confusion.</p><p>A woman&#39;s experience is different from a man&#39;s in virtually every respect, including how she is treated by the media.</p><p>I&#39;d like to believe an accumulation of experience has made me a sort of a grown-up person, so I can have judgment and taste and whatever.</p><p>Being an actor means asking people to look at you. I guess I accept that. But it&#39;s a profession in which the job is to show another world and other people. You may access it through bits of yourself, and your imagination and experience, but actually, in the end, you&#39;re not playing yourself.</p><p>I developed a mechanism so that whatever mistakes I made, I would bounce straight back. Whatever was happening off the pitch, I could put it to one side and maintain my form. Call it mental resilience or a strong mind, but that is what we mean when we talk about experience in a football team.</p><p>What if Barack Obama established a Presidential Advisory Committee that would meet once every couple of months, bringing together the former presidents for a conference in order to seek their collective wisdom? There is a wealth of experience in former presidents that generally goes untapped.</p><p>Experience is what enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.</p><p>A great many people experience the movement from one century to the next, but a minuscule number of people experience the movement from one millennium to the next.</p><p>I need more raw experience. I&#39;ve read and watched a lot of things, but I haven&#39;t done a lot of things.</p><p>An illness is like a journey into a far country it sifts all one&#39;s experience and removes it to a point so remote that it appears like a vision.</p><p>Progress is measured by richness and intensity of experience - by a wider and deeper apprehension of the significance and scope of human existence.</p><p>I had a heartbreaking experience when I was 9. I always wanted to be a guard. The most wonderful girl in the world was a guard. When I got polio and then went back to school, they made me a guard. A teacher took away my guard button.</p><p>I think how pay gets determined is pretty broad - experience, how people look, what they bring to the job. But there&#39;s no question women are paid less. Women don&#39;t ask.</p><p>Something happens to us all when we experience something as a unit that doesn&#39;t occur when we&#39;re on our couches or holding our little portable DVD players.</p><p>What we have to get clear to kids is that when you offer your stillness and open yourself to the experience of music, it pays you back more than you give.</p><p>The things I was allowed to experience, the people I was able to call friends, teammates, mentors, coaches and opponents, the travel, all of it, are far more than anything I ever thought possible in my lifetime.</p><p>It is an axiom, enforced by all the experience of the ages, that they who rule industrially will rule politically.</p><p>And it was a great experience, you know, to travel the world and compete at a certain level. It teaches you discipline, focus, and certainly keeps you out of trouble.</p><p>Food is our common ground, a universal experience.</p><p>When I was young, I was just about hard work. But as I got older, I did experience anxiety, doubt, judgment, and it&#39;s so easy to lose yourself for a second.</p><p>The nature of the global business environment guarantees that no matter how hard we work to create a stable and healthy organisation, our organisation will continue to experience dramatic changes far beyond our control.</p><p>What is the good of drawing conclusions from experience? I don&#39;t deny we sometimes draw the right conclusions, but don&#39;t we just as often draw the wrong ones?</p><p>Without in any way minimising the economic and psychological blow that people experience when they lose their jobs, the unemployed in affluent countries still have a safety net, in the form of social security payments, and usually free healthcare and free education for their children. They also have sanitation and safe drinking water.</p><p>Anyone who teaches knows that you don&#39;t really experience a text until you&#39;ve taught it, in loving detail, with an intelligent and responsive class.</p><p>Men do weird things when they experience fear. It&#39;s like a fight-or-flight thing.</p><p>In high school, I was on the youth advisory council for the Mayor&#39;s Office of Los Angeles, and that was kind of my first experience in the bureaucratic system. We tried to get things done, and nobody was really interested in getting anything done.</p><p>If your faith is opposed to experience, to human learning and investigation, it is not worth the breath used in giving it expression.</p><p>The most important American addition to the World Experience was the simple surprising fact of America. We have helped prepare mankind for all its later surprises.</p><p>All observers not laboring under hallucinations of the senses are agreed, or can be made to agree, about facts of sensible experience, through evidence toward which the intellect is merely passive, and over which the individual will and character have no control.</p><p>Our science fails to recognize those special properties of life that make it fundamental to material reality. This view of the world - biocentrism - revolves around the way a subjective experience, which we call consciousness, relates to a physical process. It is a vast mystery and one that I have pursued my entire life.</p><p>Our thoughts have an order, not of themselves, but because the mind generates the spatio-temporal relationships involved in every experience.</p><p>Politics is the only field in which the more experience you have, the worse you get.</p><p>You don&#39;t cheat anybody out of their experience, whatever it is.</p><p>Each of us brings to our job, whatever it is, our lifetime of experience and our values.</p><p>You have to see a building to comprehend it. Photographs cannot convey the experience, nor film.</p><p>So I&#39;ve seen life as one long learning process. And if I see - you know, if I fly on somebody else&#39;s airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn&#39;t in - 21 years ago, then I&#39;d think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I&#39;d like to fly on.</p><p>Without fullness of experience, length of days is nothing. When fullness of life has been achieved, shortness of days is nothing. That is perhaps why the young have usually so little fear of death they live by intensities that the elderly have forgotten.</p><p>I prefer to think of the audience as a single living organism with which I am sharing a singular, never-to-be-repeated experience.</p><p>I think in most jobs, you get better as you get older. You gain experience, you gain knowledge.</p><p>Not what we experience, but how we perceive what we experience, determines our fate.</p><p>Ordinary professionalism and 20 years&#39; experience can accomplish a lot, but it can&#39;t access the hidden places.</p><p>Art is the imposing of a pattern on experience, and our aesthetic enjoyment is recognition of the pattern.</p><p>Being a biological mother just isn&#39;t part of my experience this time around. However, I am a mother who continues to give birth to ideas and ways of experiencing life that challenge the norm.</p><p>There&#39;s a positive side to film and television, the sense of feeding into the theater... Your fans will follow you, hopefully, and be open-minded to see you play other things and experience other stories you want to tell.</p><p>The problem was to sustain at any cost the feeling you had in the theater that you were watching a real person, yes, but an intense condensation of his experience, not simply a realistic series of episodes.</p><p>Have you noticed in your past experience that your kind interpretations were almost always truer than you harsh one?</p><p>Given that religious faith is an intrinsic element of human experience, it is best to approach and engage the subject with a sense of history and a critical sensibility.</p><p>I can&#39;t control what people think. I&#39;m not trying to manipulate people&#39;s thoughts or sentiments. I write all the time. You have to experience life, make observations, and ask questions. It&#39;s machine-like how things are run now in hip-hop, and my ambitions are different.</p><p>If you&#39;re writing, you&#39;re starting in private. It can really be this amazing, private, freeing experience. Forget that it&#39;s for other people - that comes in later.</p><p>Everybody&#39;s entitled to think whatever they want and to express that, but my personal day-to-day experience does not come into contact with any of those people.</p><p>Words are capable of making experience more vivid, and also of organizing it. They can scare us, and they can comfort us.</p><p>I think on-stage nudity is disgusting, shameful and damaging to all things American. But if I were 22 with a great body, it would be artistic, tasteful, patriotic and a progressive religious experience.</p><p>So that ends my first experience of matrimony, which I always thought a highly over-rated performance.</p><p>With &#39;Good Will Hunting,&#39; Miramax made certain the recruited audience wasn&#39;t expecting to laugh at Robin Williams like they normally do. From my limited experience, you can really blow test screenings by conducting them in the wrong way.</p><p>There can be no knowledge without emotion. We may be aware of a truth, yet until we have felt its force, it is not ours. To the cognition of the brain must be added the experience of the soul.</p><p>I have never found, in a long experience of politics, that criticism is ever inhibited by ignorance.</p><p>In long experience I find that a man who trusts nobody is apt to be the kind of man nobody trusts.</p><p>I had a lot of experience with people smarter than I am.</p><p>Disease is an experience of a so-called mortal mind. It is fear made manifest on the body.</p><p>Education is when you read the fine print experience is what you get when you don&#39;t.</p><p>I just think that the collective experience of going to see a film is something you can&#39;t recreate.</p><p>There&#39;s a vintage which comes with age and experience.</p><p>I discovered early on that some performers live their life in order to act, so all their relationships are simply an experience that they can feed back into their work. Which I find vampiric.</p><p>At every step the child should be allowed to meet the real experience of life the thorns should never be plucked from his roses.</p><p>There is no wider gulf in the universe than yawns between those on the hither and thither side of vital experience.</p><p>I do write a lot from personal experience, but I also embellish a bit.</p><p>And we&#39;re seeing a higher level of consciousness and many more opportunities for people to challenge their present ways of thinking and move into a grander and larger experience of who they really are.</p><p>If we&#39;re picking people to draw out of their own conscience and experience a &#39;new&#39; Constitution, we should not look principally for good lawyers. We should look to people who agree with us. When we are in that mode, you realize we have rendered the Constitution useless.</p><p>It lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs, you also remember the age kindly.</p><p>The experience of being in space didn&#39;t change my perspective of myself or of the planet or of life. I had no spiritual experience.</p><p>You know, young actors say all the time, &#39;Should I use my own life experience?&#39; And my response is, &#39;What choice do you have?&#39;</p><p>Find what&#39;s hot, find what&#39;s just opened and then look for the worst review of the week. There is so much to learn from watching a restaurant getting absolutely panned and having a bad experience. Go and see it for yourself.</p><p>If you&#39;ve got a piece and you can feel the person who&#39;s going to direct it is really made for it, if it&#39;s really special for them, then it&#39;s going to be a better-than-usual experience.</p><p>In my books, I never portray violence as a reasonable solution to a problem. If the lead characters in the story are driven to it, it&#39;s at the extreme end of their experience.</p><p>You know, in 1975 I couldn&#39;t get a job in New York City because I was American. The kitchens were predominantly run by French, Swiss, German, and basically I got laughed at. I had education, I had experience, but got laughed at because I was American.</p><p>Music is subjective to everyone&#39;s unique experience.</p><p>The aim of all commentary on art now should be to make works of art - and, by analogy, our own experience - more, rather than less, real to us. The function of criticism should be to show how it is what it is, even that it is what it is, rather than to show what it means.</p><p>The experience and behavior that gets labeled schizophrenic is a special strategy that a person invents in order to live in an unlivable situation.</p><p>Some writers can only deal with childhood experience, because it&#39;s complete. For another kind of writer, life goes on, and he&#39;s able to keep processing that as well.</p><p>There are people hell-bent on the idea that we&#39;re a Christian band in disguise, and that we have some secret message. We have no spiritual affiliation with this music. It&#39;s simply about life experience.</p><p>If a movie is really working, you forget for two hours your Social Security number and where your car is parked. You are having a vicarious experience. You are identifying, in one way or another, with the people on the screen.</p><p>Love is blind. My politics has been, too. I think you can fall in love with ideas, and you can fall in love with people. It&#39;s a very subjective experience. And I&#39;m loyal to that experience.</p><p>Experience isn&#39;t interesting until it begins to repeat itself. In fact, till it does that, it hardly is experience.</p><p>I always thought that one of the reasons why a painter likes especially to have other painters look at his or her work is the shared experience of having pushed paint around.</p><p>Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings. It is based on the experience of one&#39;s identity as a being of worth and dignity.</p><p>I remember when I was 33 or 34, it was devastating because I realized I wasn&#39;t a kid anymore. The great thing about 40 was that I really felt like I had life experience and knew what I was doing now.</p><p>Where you are in consciousness has everything to do with what you see in experience.</p><p>Obviously an actor draws on his own experience.</p><p>I really do love Diana Ross I grew up listening to her records. I grew up in a little town in Mexico, so while we got the music, we never got the experience of watching her.</p><p>To be in a situation where you have no rights whatsoever is something I wish everybody could experience. People&#39;s attitudes would change. It would be a better place.</p><p>I always try to keep the circumstances in my life fresh. I like to change the physical environment I live in, change the people around me and try to experience things for the first time. I think that keeps one on their toes, creatively and spiritually.</p><p>The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history, like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past, the record of truths revealed by experience, is eminently practical, as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.</p><p>Intuition is the very force or activity of the soul in its experience through whatever has been the experience of the soul itself.</p><p>Producing is just a big learning experience.</p><p>Experience taught me that working families are often just one pay check away from economic disaster. And it showed me first-hand the importance of every family having access to good health care.</p><p>Existence itself does not feel horrible it feels like an ecstasy, rather, which we have only to be still to experience.</p><p>But constant experience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse it, and to carry his authority as far as it will go.</p><p>Advertising is the edge of what people know how to do and of human experience and it explains the latest ways progress has changed us to ourselves.</p><p>I think everyone&#39;s experience with a terminal disease is so deeply personal and unique to the person, the context in which they&#39;re living and the relationships that they have.</p><p>My experience is that&#39;s rare - that you have a script that is... what they call &#39;film-ready.&#39;</p><p>There is only one thing which can master the perplexed stuff of epic material into unity and that is, an ability to see in particular human experience some significant symbolism of man&#39;s general destiny.</p><p>The monsters of our childhood do not fade away, neither are they ever wholly monstrous. But neither, in my experience, do we ever reach a plane of detachment regarding our parents, however wise and old we may become. To pretend otherwise is to cheat.</p><p>A spy, like a writer, lives outside the mainstream population. He steals his experience through bribes and reconstructs it.</p><p>Mysteriously and in ways that are totally remote from natural experience, the gray drizzle of horror induced by depression takes on the quality of physical pain.</p><p>The sole substitute for an experience which we have not ourselves lived through is art and literature.</p><p>I&#39;d done table reads for my own screenplays, and I always thought they were so much fun. Why couldn&#39;t we do these for other classic screenplays and bring them to life? You can experience live theater, where you get to see plays produced by different directors and different casts, but there&#39;s really nothing like that for movie scripts.</p><p>We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It&#39;s our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.</p><p>The crucial question one comes back to is the examination without that experience is meaningless. And I think it&#39;s true that society is becoming more and more passive, less and less fired up with enthusiasm, in many spheres.</p><p>Life it is not just a series of calculations and a sum total of statistics, it&#39;s about experience, it&#39;s about participation, it is something more complex and more interesting than what is obvious.</p><p>Artists need some kind of stimulating experience a lot of times, which crystallizes when you sing about it or paint it or sculpt it. You literally mold the experience the way you want. It&#39;s therapy.</p><p>Sometimes I think our problems are made worse by the kind of business we&#39;re in. Playing these road shows is a weird experience.</p><p>Prudence is but experience, which equal time, equally bestows on all men, in those things they equally apply themselves unto.</p><p>Many women my age have known the experience of giving up crucial parts of themselves to please the man they love.</p><p>I want people to think of me as a nice person. I really am so blessed. All of this has been a great experience and I thank the American public so much for putting me in this position. I appreciate every second of it.</p><p>It has always amazed me how tax cuts don&#39;t work until they take effect. Mr. Obama&#39;s experience with deferred tax rate increases will be the reverse. The economy will collapse in 2011.</p><p>Men and women who have served in harm&#39;s way experience higher rates of divorce and suicide. Many battle the debilitating effects and stigma associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p><p>No matter how close to personal experience a story might be, inevitably you are going to get to a part that isn&#39;t yours and, actually, whether it happened or not becomes irrelevant. It is all about choosing the right words.</p><p>The bullied straight kid goes home to a shoulder to cry on and support and can talk freely about his experience at school and why he&#39;s being bullied. I couldn&#39;t go home and open up to my parents.</p><p>When you go to the movies with your whole family, it&#39;s a different experience. For some reason, it&#39;s something that you&#39;re all doing together and you take away something special in that.</p><p>Making an album should be an honest experience. It shouldn&#39;t be about trying to gauge where popular music is today it should be about artistic expression and putting down what you want to put down.</p><p>My life path has been a blessing and a great learning experience. Skateboarding is my passion and I don&#39;t see that changing. When I&#39;m not skating, I love to surf. I&#39;m open to the new experiences and opportunities.</p><p>However it is debased or misinterpreted, love is a redemptive feature. To focus on one individual so that their desires become superior to yours is a very cleansing experience.</p><p>All of the legal defense funds out there, they&#39;re looking for people out there with court of appeals experience, because court of appeals is where policy is made. And I know, I know this is on tape and I should never say that because we don&#39;t make law, I know. I know.</p><p>Fun is to experience things you would not have been able to experience in any other setting.</p><p>I have this horrible sense of humor where I think discomfort is funny - partly because I experience discomfort a lot, and it&#39;s a way of laughing at it and getting a release.</p><p>I was emotionally and physically punched in the stomach. This is not a place where you go and deliver the lines and then you come back. It&#39;s kind of a life-changing experience. But it can&#39;t get better than this for any actor - this is like an opera.</p><p>No characters in &#39;Stay Close,&#39; including the leads, are black and white. I want them to be grey. I think that makes for a much more interesting reading experience, something that will stay with you a little bit longer.</p><p>Fatigue is what we experience, but it is what a match is to an atomic bomb.</p><p>I have relationships with people I&#39;m working with, based on our combined interest. It doesn&#39;t make the relationship any less sincere, but it does give it a focus that may not last beyond the experience.</p><p>If we could only snap the fetters of the body that bind the feet of the soul, we shall experience a great joy. Then we shall not be miserable because of the body&#39;s sufferings. We shall become free.</p><p>You have to experience life, make observations, and ask questions.</p><p>Everybody&#39;s got one killer story. It doesn&#39;t take talent to tell that story, it just takes experience.</p><p>Any place that anyone can learn something useful from someone with experience is an educational institution.</p><p>We need creativity in order to break free from the temporary structures that have been set up by a particular sequence of experience.</p><p>A great deal has been written in recent years about the purported lack of motivation in the children of the Negro ghettos. Little in my experience supports this, yet the phrase has been repeated endlessly, and the blame in almost all cases is placed somewhere outside the classroom.</p><p>Though &#39;Fire and Rain&#39; is very personal, for other people it resonates as a sort of commonly held experience... And that&#39;s what happens with me. I write things for personal reasons, and then in some cases it... can be a shared experience.</p><p>I know there are people who don&#39;t like their audience or like the experience of being recognized or celebrated, but my audience has been very good - they don&#39;t bother me and when they do contact me it&#39;s usually on the nicest possible terms.</p><p>Performing is a profound experience, at least for me. It&#39;s not as if I sit down and play &#39;Fire and Rain&#39; by myself, just to hear it again. But to offer it up... the energy that it somehow summons live takes me right back, and I do get a reconnection to the emotions.</p><p>Performing is a profound experience, at least for me.</p><p>I&#39;ve told people who have just started to make a film that the one thing you might experience is this feeling that everybody is conspiring against you, because you&#39;re not necessarily able to tell what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not.</p><p>The American experience influenced my understanding of individuality, basic human rights, freedom of expression and the rights and responsibilities of citizens.</p><p>My own experience is that a certain kind of genius among students is best brought out in bed.</p><p>To the artist is sometimes granted a sudden, transient insight which serves in this matter for experience. A flash, and where previously the brain held a dead fact, the soul grasps a living truth! At moments we are all artists.</p><p>Anything that&#39;s different from your own realm of experience as a human being, whether it&#39;s driving a car or a boat, or using guns, anything that separates you from yourself and leads you more towards this character&#39;s existence is a big help.</p><p>I remember when I took Quentin Tarantino with me to a very private screening of the documentary &#39;Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,&#39; which shows some of the legal irregularities of his case. I was involved by the film, and it was an amazing experience to see people weep at the end of it.</p><p>What is truth? Truth doesn&#39;t really exist. Who is going to judge whether my experience of an incident is more valid than yours? No one can be trusted to be the judge of that.</p><p>America is an idea. And it&#39;s the solemn responsibility of each &#39;temporary&#39; president to protect and nurture that noblest of all ideas - with integrity. This man, Mitt Romney, has shown - not through his experience, but through his actions and words - that he is unqualified to carry out that responsibility.</p><p>I absolutely believe in the power of tithing and giving back. My own experience about all the blessings I&#39;ve had in my life is that the more I give away, the more that comes back. That is the way life works, and that is the way energy works.</p><p>Every day is a new experience and I take it as it comes.</p><p>Reading a book is like re-writing it for yourself. You bring to a novel, anything you read, all your experience of the world. You bring your history and you read it in your own terms.</p><p>Some of us are interested in directors, but really the vast majority of us are interested in actors. You experience the films through the actors, so they&#39;re all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.</p><p>I don&#39;t want people to sit there and objectively watch the film. I want them to experience it as something that&#39;s under their skin, so you try to make the films really tactile.</p><p>You experience the films through the actors, so they&#39;re all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.</p><p>I think it&#39;s easy for people to assume that fame is equal to glory, but it can be a very isolating experience.</p><p>Orlando&#39;s a really cool guy. They hired him for &#39;Lord of the Rings&#39; out of drama school. He&#39;s very new at this still and doesn&#39;t have a lot of experience. So we were in this together and we&#39;ve tried to help each other out. We felt very equal which was good.</p><p>I have three goddaughters - I&#39;m not sure why they trust me, because I have no experience with children - but I try.</p><p>I left Jamaica for a while, because as an artist I need to experience different things, see the world, have different energies. Living in one place is not good for me.</p><p>I always considered myself as a character actor. I always try to be versatile to show different sides of human experience.</p><p>I think I can make an entirely new game experience, and if I can&#39;t do it, some other game designer will.</p><p>I don&#39;t think as a creator that I could create an experience that truly feels interactive if you don&#39;t have something to hold in your hand, if you don&#39;t have something like force feedback that you can feel from the controller.</p><p>Games have grown and developed from this limited in-the-box experience to something that&#39;s everywhere now. Interactive content is all around us, networked, ready. This is something I&#39;ve been hoping for throughout my career.</p><p>The spectacles of experience through them you will see clearly a second time.</p><p>I&#39;m a very passionate believer in the unity of knowledge. There is one world of reality - one world of our experience that we&#39;re seeking to describe.</p><p>Bottom up thinkers try to start from experience and move from experience to understanding. They don&#39;t start with certain general principles they think beforehand are likely to be true they just hope to find out what reality is like.</p><p>When I&#39;m home on a break, I lock myself in my room and play guitar. After two or three hours, I start getting into this total meditation. It&#39;s a feeling few people experience, and that&#39;s usually when I come up with weird stuff. It just flows. I can&#39;t force myself. I don&#39;t sit down and say I&#39;ve got to practice.</p><p>A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful, but I&#39;ve seen quite a few deaths, and, with one exception, I&#39;ve never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That&#39;s amazing when you think about it. I mean, how complicated the mechanism is that&#39;s being taken apart.</p><p>But beginners to the World Economics Forum have to understand there is no single Davos experience, and there is no single Davos community either. There are numerous tribes who interact only at a minimal level.</p><p>It&#39;s always an interesting experience for a politician to be heard in silence, I have to say.</p><p>It&#39;s a very small and select slice of all the people who have ever been born. I believe we&#39;ve come back during this time, those of us who are here now, specifically to experience it. And to cause a &#39;quickening of the spirit.&#39;</p><p>I wanted to experience New York, to look up and see buildings.</p><p>A rare experience of a moment at daybreak, when something in nature seems to reveal all consciousness, cannot be explained at noon. Yet it is part of the day&#39;s unity.</p><p>I think I have a tendency to look at things subjectively rather than objectively when I reflect on my experience.</p><p>Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character.</p><p>Age is only a number, a cipher for the records. A man can&#39;t retire his experience. He must use it. Experience achieves more with less energy and time.</p><p>Women artists need to break barriers in order for women&#39;s experience to be valuable.</p><p>I think generally I&#39;m kind of interested in subjective experience, what goes on inside someone&#39;s head, that being all they really know of the world.</p><p>The wisdom and experience of older people is a resource of inestimable worth. Recognizing and treasuring the contributions of older people is essential to the long-term flourishing of any society.</p><p>A commitment to human rights cannot be fostered simply through the transmission of knowledge. Action and experience play a crucial role in the learning process.</p><p>Writing a novel is a terrible experience, during which the hair often falls out and the teeth decay.</p><p>Lord of the Rings was my first experience making movies and at the time, I had no ideas how movies were done. I thought that&#39;s the way they&#39;re done, so in a way, I had nothing to compare it to.</p><p>I&#39;m not particularly precious about the theatrical experience any more.</p><p>A lot of why I do something is just the novelty of the experience.</p><p>Every experience feeds an actor, and I&#39;ve learned that depression is all around us.</p><p>I want to be able to experience everything. I want to experience being a husband, experience being a father, experience, maybe, hopefully, someday being a grandfather, and all those things. I want that experience. When I die, I want to be exhausted.</p><p>All experience is subjective.</p><p>We have that illusion that we are &#39;deciding&#39; what to make a character do, in order to &#39;convey our message&#39; or something like that. But, at least in my experience, you are often more like a river-rafting guide who&#39;s been paid a bonus to purposely steer your clients into the roughest possible water.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t read you don&#39;t have the voice. The lack of voice eliminates experience.</p><p>Although our inattention can contribute to our lack of total well-being, we also have the power to choose positive behaviors and responses. In that choice we change our every experience of life!</p><p>I&#39;m very accepting with my age. It&#39;s like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you&#39;ve become comfortable in your skin.</p><p>A statesman wants courage and a statesman wants vision but believe me, after six months&#39; experience, he wants first, second, third and all the time - patience.</p><p>Through the years of experience I have found that air offers less resistance than dirt.</p><p>You have to trust your kids. They have to experience life, and you just hope you&#39;ve provided them a foundation for what&#39;s right and what isn&#39;t.</p><p>I had great faith in Irish actors, that they&#39;d be hip to the whole theatre thing, and they are. I had no illusions of coming over here as some kind of big shot. It&#39;s been a learning experience for me too.</p><p>You can live your whole life in your brain and not experience what&#39;s around you. You go crazy that way.</p><p>No matter how vital experience might be while you lived it, no sooner was it ended and dead than it became as lifeless as the piles of dry dust in a school history book.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t all experience crumble in the end to mere literary material?</p><p>I started off on stage because it was the only work I could get. I haven&#39;t been back for 11 years. I think any stage experience is good experience, as far as being an actor is concerned.</p><p>No one ever pretended that shopping for anything is a rational experience. If it were, would there be Fluffernutter? Laceless sneakers? Porkpie hats? Would the Chia Pet even exist?</p><p>My own life has in some ways been a decades-long tour of the sibling experience. I have full sibs, I have half-sibs, and for a time I had step-sibs.</p><p>There are a lot of obstacles in the way of our understanding animal intelligence - not the least being that we can&#39;t even agree whether nonhuman species are conscious. We accept that chimps and dolphins experience awareness we like to think dogs and cats do. But what about mice and newts? What about a fly? Is anything going on there at all?</p><p>As with real reading, the ability to comprehend subtlety and complexity comes only with time and a lot of experience. If you don&#39;t adequately acquire those skills, moving out into the real world of real people can actually become quite scary.</p><p>Bringing an end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians may help the young Arab generation to realise their aspirations. Israel is more than willing to offer our experience in building a modern economy in spite of limited resources to the whole region.</p><p>I like directors who have worked as actors. They know the experience.</p><p>Yes, I&#39;ve listened to just a few audiobooks - but hope to listen to more. I&#39;ve wanted to investigate how my own books sound in this format and find the experience of listening, and not reading, quite fascinating.</p><p>There&#39;s no wrong way to experience a film.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m a very original thinker, but if I have a good experience with something, I&#39;ll want to take it further or adapt it in some way.</p><p>For me, titles are either a natural two-second experience or stressful enough to give you an ulcer. If they don&#39;t pop out perfect on the first try, they can be really hard to repair. Or, worse, if the author thinks they pop out perfect, but the publishing house does not agree, it&#39;s difficult to shift gears. And then? Then you go insane.</p><p>Stories have always been the things that entertain me and make me feel happy and sad and move me and give me the experience of being able to live many lives in one lifetime. It&#39;s the best thing about being alive.</p><p>If you&#39;re out there stressing on your pro day, then you&#39;re not going to perform well, so I plan on having a little fun. Play a little music while we&#39;re out there throwing the football, have everybody tapping their toes and bobbing their head and just go out there and make the most of the experience.</p><p>I find increasingly that the more extreme are the things going on in your life, the more cultural reference points fail you. More mythical reference points actually help, and you realise that&#39;s what myths are for. It&#39;s for human beings to process their experience in extremis.</p><p>I think being a parent is the most challenging thing you do. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here. It&#39;s at the heart of what it is to be a human being. It&#39;s the ultimate experience because it questions everything about who you are. But it&#39;s difficult.</p><p>If one area I felt it was a tough election was I couldn&#39;t see my young son and I couldn&#39;t see my wife a lot, but apart from that for her also it was an experience.</p><p>In fact the experience at Oxford has really helped me later in life.</p><p>I was quite able at the insignificant work I did in MI6, but absolutely dysfunctional in my domestic life. I had no experience of fatherhood. I had no example of marital bliss or the family unit.</p><p>As an actress, it&#39;s part of your job to be able to imagine just about anything - even if it&#39;s not within your personal experience.</p><p>If you search and search and stop searching, then ultimately you&#39;ll find what you need. It is the experience of living.</p><p>Writing a story or a novel is one way of discovering sequence in experience, of stumbling upon cause and effect in the happenings of a writer&#39;s own life.</p><p>I learn from experience.</p><p>It&#39;s always good to get a smaller tournament under your belt so that by the time you get to the Slams, you have a lot of experience.</p><p>There&#39;s no experience like on-the-job training.</p><p>I started thinking about joy. Everything in our society is so purposeful. Let&#39;s bring joy back to the experience.</p><p>When I was 27 years old, I organized legal aid clinics to help low-income seniors. It was a life-altering experience.</p><p>Yes, all my songs come from personal experience and relationships.</p><p>The essence of a role-playing game is that it is a group, cooperative experience.</p><p>I think newspapers shouldn&#39;t try to compete directly with the Web, and should do what they can do better, which may be long-form journalism and using photos and art, and making connections with large-form graphics and really enhancing the tactile experience of paper.</p><p>Well, my background is journalism. I don&#39;t have any creative-writing experience except for one class I took as a sophomore in college.</p><p>Religion points to that area of human experience where in one way or another man comes upon mystery as a summons to pilgrimage.</p><p>Do I ever think Gossip will be really massive in America? No, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll happen - and that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s kind of nice because I get to experience everything at once. I get to come home and it not be weird, like in Paris or something. It is nice to be completely anonymous.</p><p>Great art - or good art - is when you look at it, experience it and it stays in your mind. I don&#39;t think conceptual art and traditional art are all that different.</p><p>These are tough times and under this Tory-led government many people in Manchester are suffering and getting left behind. If elected I will use all my energy, skills, experience and knowledge to stand up for our communities and get things done for the better.</p><p>I guess my experience with some stuff is kind of abstract.</p><p>For me, I&#39;d rather have an intense experience than not.</p><p>Boredom is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience. A rustling in the leaves drives him away.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t go up on a stage now if you paid a thousand dollars for one minute of acting. It&#39;s a nasty experience. You&#39;re up there all by yourself. You&#39;re so damn exposed.</p><p>I was never afraid of failure after that because, I think, coming that close to death you get kissed. With the years, the actual experience of course fades, but the flavor of it doesn&#39;t. I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?</p><p>My parents had an experience of life that is as opposite to mine as you can imagine.</p><p>It&#39;s wonderful to be in love. And it&#39;s definitely wonderful to cuddle and have sex and get to experience life with somebody. But it&#39;s OK if you don&#39;t find him and you&#39;re 24. You can find it someday.</p><p>No matter what his position or experience in life, there is in everyone more latent than developed ability far more unused than used power.</p><p>I felt alienated by the experience and decided to stay away from corporate employment.</p><p>The printed page conveys information and commitment, and requires active involvement. Television conveys emotion and experience, and it&#39;s very limited in what it can do logically. It&#39;s an existential experience - there and then gone.</p><p>None of us feels the true love of God till we realize how wicked we are. But you can&#39;t teach people that - they have to learn by experience.</p><p>I enjoy writing but I much prefer the experience of having written.</p><p>The fact that I am a writer comes from the experience of being cut away from my roots and living in Venezuela, where I couldn&#39;t find a place for myself, for years and years.</p><p>People were being so mean as a result of my ability - a gift, really. So I think that&#39;s what makes me fight harder to provide an option to aspiring kids or artists. I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to go through what I went through... to see a little girl or a little dancer experience such unnecessary rejection.</p><p>I have the ordinary experience of being anonymous when I&#39;m in an airplane talking to air-traffic control, and they don&#39;t know who they&#39;re talking to. I have a lot of common experiences.</p><p>To me, the job of the artist is to provide a useful and intelligent vocabulary for the world to be able to articulate feelings they experience everyday, and otherwise wouldn&#39;t have the means to express in a meaningful and useful way.</p><p>Making movies is a very different experience in a lot of ways. It&#39;s difficult when you&#39;re used to owning the copyright and having a landlord&#39;s possessory rights - I rent my plays to the companies that do them and, if I&#39;m upset, I can pull the play. But the only two directors I&#39;ve worked with are pretty great.</p><p>Acting can be a narrow and isolated experience, because you only examine your particular part.</p><p>In my experience, there is only one motivation, and that is desire. No reasons or principle contain it or stand against it.</p><p>That&#39;s one of the benefits of working on big budget films. You work with people who have a lot of experience and you get to learn a lot.</p><p>I was an only child. I&#39;ve known only children. From this experience, I do believe that the children should outnumber the parents.</p><p>Film is such a bizarre vehicle for acting. It&#39;s such a bizarre experience. I don&#39;t think you ever really get familiar with it. If you do get familiar with it, you&#39;re probably not that good anymore.</p><p>When a novel has 200,000 words, then it is possible for the reader to experience 200,000 delights, and to turn back to the first page of the book and experience them all over again, perhaps more intensely.</p><p>I definitely feel more complete than before. There&#39;s a void you have when you don&#39;t feel you&#39;ve found the other part of who you are, so I&#39;m in a different place now and that&#39;s nice to experience.</p><p>I think it&#39;s really, really important to mix it up as an actor, to try to get as much kind of varied experience as you can, not only for your own personal growth as an actor but for the audience to keep them guessing about what you&#39;re going to do.</p><p>I&#39;m a method writer. In order to write about the emotion, I have to experience it. I get physically tired and exhausted, devoting hours and hours and hours to it.</p><p>You can&#39;t dodge them all. I got hammered plenty of times through the years. But you just get up and keep playing. I can tell you from experience, though. Sometimes it hurts like hell.</p><p>It is often difficult to watch yourself onscreen, especially 60-feet high. As an actor, it is an uncomfortable experience.</p><p>I&#39;ve learned through experience of playing different characters, some of whom were jerks, that when you play a character who is pretentious or obnoxious, in any way, it&#39;s important to knock them down a peg.</p><p>I have a mess in my head sometimes, and there&#39;s something very satisfying about putting it into words. Certainly it&#39;s not something that you&#39;re in charge of, necessarily, but writing about it, putting it into your words, can be a very powerful experience.</p><p>A city building, you experience when you walk a suburban building, you experience when you drive.</p><p>My worst hair experience was when I was trying to relax my hair and my grandmother did it. It went all straight and I looked like a black Bee Gee.</p><p>Actually, music gave me the support when I needed it. I would never have gone to college unless I&#39;d gotten a piano scholarship. And now I&#39;m so glad I got to learn to play the cello, which is a different experience, you&#39;re flexing a different muscle, but it&#39;s beautiful because it is music.</p><p>I hate these platforms that are all over the place today they are all about grabbing attention. They are suburban! I never do a platform. Well, I did, in the 1970s, but that was a bad experience.</p><p>There&#39;s full consensus in the military that women shouldn&#39;t be in person-to-person combat. I don&#39;t know if we have enough experience to know whether this is the right approach. But women can be elsewhere. We have mandatory military service in Chile. I pushed for women in all areas.</p><p>Practical wisdom is only to be learned in the school of experience. Precepts and instruction are useful so far as they go, but, without the discipline of real life, they remain of the nature of theory only.</p><p>Our subjective experience of time is highly variable. We all know that days can pass like weeks and months can feel like years, and that the opposite can be just as true: A month or year can zoom by in what feels like no time at all.</p><p>The experience gathered from books, though often valuable, is but the nature of learning whereas the experience gained from actual life is one of the nature of wisdom.</p><p>Just as we accumulate memories of facts by integrating them into a network, we accumulate life experiences by integrating them into a web of other chronological memories. The denser the web, the denser the experience of time.</p><p>Experience teaches us that we do not always receive the blessings we ask for in prayer.</p><p>My father respected and admired my mother and was a person who was always standing by my side, encouraging me to do more and believed in my capacity. So in that sense, my own experience was very good in becoming an empowered woman. From early on, I carried that strong message: &#39;You can do it.&#39; So I never had any doubt that women can do a lot.</p><p>Other people do not have to change for us to experience peace of mind.</p><p>I believe that being an actress or being involved in a movie has to be a life experience, otherwise why go for it? I have to change me, and I have to learn things, and I have to push me and my limits. By acting, I find a freedom inside of a prison in a way.</p><p>Like every aspect of cancer I&#39;ve weathered thus far, today&#39;s experience was not at all demoralizing, expensive or humiliating. No, it was just plain fun.</p><p>Life is full of change and uncertainty. We know this. We experience it on a daily basis.</p><p>I&#39;ve had a fair amount of experience with snakes, and I find them to be pretty honest in terms of how you read their body language and emotions. They&#39;ll tell you when they&#39;re grumpy. They&#39;ll tell you when they&#39;re okay.</p><p>Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don&#39;t.</p><p>I had such a close relationship with my dog, and my dog so filled the need in my life to have children that I just wanted Cathy to have that experience.</p><p>Baseball is a rookie, his experience no bigger than the lump in his throat as he begins fulfillment of his dream.</p><p>If the experience of science teaches anything, it&#39;s that the world is very strange and surprising. The many revolutions in science have certainly shown that.</p><p>The impulse to dream was slowly beaten out of me by experience. Now it surged up again and I hungered for books, new ways of looking and seeing.</p><p>I think theatre is by far the most rewarding experience for an actor. You get 4 weeks to rehearse your character and then at 7:30 pm you start acting and nobody stops you, acting with your entire soul.</p><p>But in the back of my mind I&#39;ve always looked to the biggest-scale Hollywood movies. Because to me the most satisfying experience is of watching a movie, if it&#39;s done really well. And so that aspiration is always it for me, if I have the opportunity to do it.</p><p>Man tells his aspiration in his God but in his demon he shows his depth of experience.</p><p>In my experience, it&#39;s all wonderful with girls until about 16. Around that time, boys kind of calm down and start focusing their testosterone. Girls get a little challenging, especially for fathers.</p><p>Whenever something happens that makes me laugh or if I remember something in the middle of the night that I want to share, I jot the experience down.</p><p>My kids will grow up in a house knowing that it&#39;s perfectly normal for two men to be in love, it&#39;s perfectly normal for two women to be in love. My kids will grow up knowing it&#39;s all about love. It doesn&#39;t matter who you&#39;re with and everyone should have that experience.</p><p>I&#39;d like to work with Justin Bieber. He&#39;s talented and he&#39;s so young. I know what he&#39;s going through. I&#39;ve lived what he&#39;s living through right now. Working with him would complete a circle of sorts for me. And he might find it a worthwhile experience himself.</p><p>Donny and Marie&#39; was a great experience. I tried so hard to be a great talk show host but it&#39;s all about relaxing and enjoying it. Marie and I finally figured that out. I would have liked it to continue but I&#39;m kind of glad it&#39;s over because of the phenomenal workload.;Donny Osmond;experience 18094;I didn&#39;t go to high school, so I don&#39;t have a high school experience. I was home-schooled during high school.;Josh Hutcherson;experience 18095;My faith experience, well, as you can imagine, you need a lot of faith to raise five boys.;Ann Romney;experience 18096;It&#39;s been quite an experience, being conservative and living in the North East.;Ann Romney;experience 18097;There can be nothing exclusive about substantial art. It comes directly out of the heart of the experience of life and thinking about life and living life.;Charles Ives;experience 18098;I decided blacks should not have to experience the difficulties I had faced, so I decided to open a flying school and teach other black women to fly.;Bessie Coleman;experience 18099;The only time I ever went hunting I remembered it as a grisly experience.;Gloria Swanson;experience 18100;When you do find humor in trying times, one of the first and most important changes you experience is that you see your perplexing problems in a new way - you suddenly have a new perspective on them.;Allen Klein;experience 18101;My Marine experience helped shape who I am now personally and professionally, and I am grateful for that on an almost daily basis.;Jim Lehrer;experience 18102;A sense of freedom is something that, happily, comes with age and life experience.;Diane Keaton;experience 18103;The act of writing... is the act of trying to understand why my opinion is what it is. And ultimately, I think that&#39;s the same experience the reader has when they pick up one of my books.;Jodi Picoult;experience 18104;To pursue a so-called Third Way is foolish. We had our experience with this in the 1960s when we looked for a socialism with a human face. It did not work, and we must be explicit that we are not aiming for a more efficient version of a system that has failed.;Vaclav Klaus;experience 18105;And I thought, when I have kids, that&#39;s the sort of well told, silly, and fun fairy tale that I would want to take them to. But it was an amazing experience. And I think Shrek is a real classic, a fairy tale classic.;Mike Myers;experience 18106;I would love to be a father. I had a great father who taught me how gratifying that is. I&#39;m not going to deny myself that. I think I&#39;d be good at it. Everybody wants that experience. I definitely do.;Mike Myers;experience 18107;You can never regret anything you do in life. You kind of have to learn the lesson from whatever the experience is and take it with you on your journey forward.;Aubrey O&#39;Day;experience 18108;When I go to my live shows it&#39;s often a multigenerational audience, a family bonding experience.;Al Yankovic;experience 18109;Directing is a more pragmatic experience, where you have to deal with the restrictions of time and money that force you to make certain decisions you don&#39;t have to make when you&#39;re writing.;Charlie Kaufman;experience 18110;When I&#39;m writing, I&#39;m trying to immerse myself in the chaos of an emotional experience, rather than separate myself from it and look back at it from a distance with clarity and tell it as a story. Because that&#39;s how life is lived, you know?;Charlie Kaufman;experience 18111;I think you just assume that your memory is just sort of a video playback of your experience, but it&#39;s nothing like that at all. It&#39;s a complete refabrication of an event and a lot of it is made up, because you&#39;re filling in spaces.;Charlie Kaufman;experience 18112;Reading the play at home, however fulfilling, can never be the vivacious experience that Shakespeare intended.;Arthur Smith;experience 18113;Learning is a tunnel experience that makes us think more broadly.;Anna Deavere Smith;experience 18114;In life there are no problems, that is, objective and external choices there is only the life which we do not resolve as a problem but which we live as an experience, whatever the final result may be.;Alberto Moravia;experience 18115;Have you ever watched someone become American? Last week, at a national citizenship conference I organize, thirty immigrants from 17 countries swore an oath and became citizens of the United States. It was a stirring experience for the hundreds of people in the room.;Eric Liu;experience 18116;People who run for president seriously and people who become president enter a bizarre secret society in which they have had an experience that none of us will ever have.;John Hodgman;experience 18117;The most experience I had in the criminology field is playing a thug as an actor. That was my first paid job. The police academy at the college was paying people to reenact the calls that potential cops would get. So I got to play thugs and people who were unruly.;Jeremy Renner;experience 18118;It was a very profound experience, getting in touch with that part of us, in all of us human beings, that is committed beyond yourself to the point of giving everything you have, including your life, for other people, for your fellow man.;Raul Julia;experience 18119;While I was trying to save money to go to the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Australia I ended up getting all of this experience which meant that by the time I had enough money in the bank to go to school I didn&#39;t really need to go to school anymore.;Russell Crowe;experience 18120;You can learn more from the lows than the highs. The highs are great but the lows make you really look at things in a different way and want to improve. Every player will have both in their careers and I have, but what you get is that experience which is so important to perform at your best.;Wayne Rooney;experience 18121;As is known, it is in the realm of experience inaugurated by psychoanalysis that we may grasp along what imaginary lines the human organism, in the most intimate recesses of its being, manifests its capture in a symbolic dimension.;Jacques Lacan;experience 18122;I think the most interesting parts of human experience might be the sparks that come from that sort of chipping flint of cultures rubbing against each other. And living on the border between Mexico and the U.S. for so many years gave me a lot of insight into that.;Barbara Kingsolver;experience 18123;I eventually became proud of my strikeouts, because each one represented another learning experience.;Willie Stargell;experience 18124;I think experience will teach you a combination of liberalism and conservatism. We have to be progressive and at the same time we have to retain values. We have to hold onto the past as we explore the future.;Oliver Stone;experience 18125;I would vote for the man who&#39;s lived life, who&#39;s done different occupations, who&#39;s been out in the real world and struggled to make a living, struggled to raise a family, struggled with life as it exists. So I&#39;d vote for experience, honest experience.;Oliver Stone;experience 18126;It was a great experience for a kid, because it was a bunch of kids playing on pirate ships and water slides, so looking back on it, it was the fondest experience of my childhood.;Corey Feldman;experience 18127;We certainly want those at the top to do well, but if you base your entire presidency and your entire economic platform on helping them do even better, you&#39;re missing what makes the economy tick. Because not everyone has been as fortunate as Mitt Romney, you cannot base your whole approach on a life experience as rarified as his.;Charles Schumer;experience 18128;There are many reasons why Mitt Romney should not become president, but perhaps the most important of all is the narrowness of his experience, perspective and vision.;Charles Schumer;experience 18129;There are more people than you think who want to have a challenging experience, in which they are obliged to reflect about the past.;Umberto Eco;experience 18130;When I&#39;m writing, I&#39;m constantly thinking about myself, because it&#39;s the only experience I have to draw on. And I don&#39;t see an exact reflection of myself in every face in the audience, but I know that my songs have validity to them, and that&#39;s why the fans are there.;Chester Bennington;experience 18131;I think women don&#39;t grow up with the harsh world of criticism that men grow up with, we are more sensitively treated, and when you first experience the world of film-making you have to develop a very tough skin.;Jane Campion;experience 18132;With &#39;Bright Star&#39; and with &#39;The Piano,&#39; too, I felt a kind of sadness about it being in such a different era, because of my lack of experience with the era. And one of the ways I&#39;d get over it is to remind myself that every film, even if it&#39;s contemporary, creates its own world.;Jane Campion;experience 18133;In almost everything, experience is more valuable than precept.;Quintilian;experience 18134;You shouldn&#39;t be afraid of failure - when something fails, you think, &#39;What did I learn from that experience? I can do better next time.&#39; Then kill that project and move on to the next. Don&#39;t get disappointed.;Niklas Zennstrom;experience 18135;I think that the mark of a great book is that it will meet you wherever you&#39;re at and you&#39;ll feel and experience something new and different each time you read it.;Josh Radnor;experience 18136;Well, I stopped drinking. That was actually a big deal. I didn&#39;t go through any harrowing rock-bottom experience. I just made a decision to stop drinking.;Josh Radnor;experience 18137;Whatever it is you want to do, take a job in that field. You will learn by experience and, slow and steady, you&#39;ll get it done!;Rachael Ray;experience 18138;I feel that the Christian experience and the Jewish one have much to give each other. If this open society continues and there is no return to political anti-Semitism, then this encounter, deeper than any theology, may happen.;Lionel Blue;experience 18139;One of the things in the back of my mind is that, after my sports experience, I never want to be, totally consumed by any one endeavor, other than my family life.;Julius Erving;experience 18140;By experience we find out a short way by a long wandering.;Roger Ascham;experience 18141;I think most artists will experience a lot of negative people on Twitter but, thank God, I&#39;ve got so many followers that I&#39;m not able to see them that much. I&#39;ll see some from time to time but, for the most part, I always focus on something good.;Nicki Minaj;experience 18142;I think we&#39;re the only jokeless show on television. I mean really, we have no setups and no punch lines. It&#39;s not a joke show. There are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human.;Rainn Wilson;experience 18143;Experience tells you what to do confidence allows you to do it.;Stan Smith;experience 18144;My time at Shell was a most valuable experience because it taught me to look at the world in a long-term way. Shell takes a 20-year view on events and plans for different scenarios. It makes you see the world as a kind of large matrix.;Vince Cable;experience 18145;I feel that between my experience and my mother&#39;s, breast cancer is a little bit like someone who lives next door. I know what that person looks like and what their daily habits are.;Cynthia Nixon;experience 18146;An adolescent is somebody who is in between things. A teenager is somebody who&#39;s kind of permanently there. And so living with them through the various teenage hopes and sorrows and joys was curiously enough a maturing experience for me.;Andrew Greeley;experience 18147;I raised five children. They all have different personalities. All of them have different issues, different levels of success. That was a learning experience for me.;T. D. Jakes;experience 18148;Physics is experience, arranged in economical order.;Ernst Mach;experience 18149;Individuals approaching death often experience encounters with their dead relatives, who seem to welcome them to the next world. These deathbed visions are authentic and convincing they are often followed by a state of euphoria and seem to ease the transition.;Stanislav Grof;experience 18150;I read Freud&#39;s Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis in basically one sitting. I decided to enroll in medical school. It was almost like a conversion experience.;Stanislav Grof;experience 18151;Dying before dying has two important consequences: It liberates the individual from the fear of death and influences the actual experience of dying at the time of biological demise.;Stanislav Grof;experience 18152;I mean, I&#39;m an uncle of seven or eight, and I don&#39;t mind it at all! Kids are great. Kids are the best six-hour experience you can have!;Chris O&#39;Dowd;experience 18153;By presenting a faithful and honest record of my experience as a mother, I hope to show both my readers and my children how truth can redeem even what you fear might be the gravest of sins.;Ayelet Waldman;experience 18154;I have my team. Like if you see everyone around me - I have my hair and makeup girl, my assistant. They&#39;re very calm, they&#39;re all about positive energy. There&#39;re no drama queens. Everyone wants everyone else to have a positive experience. There are no agendas. I think it creates a healthy environment and there are no boundaries to cross.;Fergie;experience 18155;When you&#39;re a soul singer, I&#39;m singing a lot of songs about love and relationships that I think a lot of girls really relate to. For whatever reason, that seems to get &#39;em excited. The DJ, everyone always says the DJ gets all the chicks, but that&#39;s never been my experience.;Mayer Hawthorne;experience 18156;My experience, with both my parents, is that grief has a lot of down, sad things, but I was also really emotionally raw, in the first year after each of them passed. Flowers smelled more intensely, my relationships were hotter, and I was more willing to risk. I was going for it a lot more. I was &#39;unsober&#39; and I wasn&#39;t playing by my rules.;Mike Mills;experience 18157;Quality is a direct experience independent of and prior to intellectual abstractions.;Robert M. Pirsig;experience 18158;Although we have, in theory, abolished human slavery, recognized women&#39;s rights, and stopped child labor, we continue to enslave other species who, if we simply pay attention, show quite clearly that they experience parental love, pain, and the desire for freedom, just as we do.;Ingrid Newkirk;experience 18159;Fundamental ideas are not a consequence of experience, but a result of the particular constitution and activity of the mind, which is independent of all experience in its origin, though constantly combined with experience in its exercise.;William Whewell;experience 18160;People only talk about what a joyous experience it is, but there is terror: Your life, as you know it, is over. It&#39;s over the day that child is born. It&#39;s over, and something completely new starts.;Bill Murray;experience 18161;Emigration, forced or chosen, across national frontiers or from village to metropolis, is the quintessential experience of our time.;John Berger;experience 18162;Experience is that marvelous thing that enable you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.;Franklin P. Jones;experience 18163;Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that&#39;s ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience.;Michael Haneke;experience 18164;You can use your means in a good and bad way. In German-speaking art, we had such a bad experience with the Third Reich, when stories and images were used to tell lies. After the war, literature was careful not to do the same, which is why writers began to reflect on the stories they told and to make readers part of their texts. I do the same.;Michael Haneke;experience 18165;What&#39;s great about the geek spirit is that life never seems to stop us, and they never seem to kill our enthusiasm, our optimism and our hunger to experience the world. We keep our sense of humor, we protect our dignity, we talk to our friends about the experience and then we start again fresh the very next day.;Paul Feig;experience 18166;The greatest way for people to experience a comedy is to go in not knowing anything about it. But because of marketing, it&#39;s impossible. Marketing meaning that in order to get people to come you can&#39;t just go, &#39;Hey, there&#39;s a great movie - we&#39;re not going to show you anything from it but trust us!</p><p>At an incredibly divisive point in pop history, Donna Summer managed to create an undeniable across-the-board experience of mass pleasure - after &#39;Bad Girls,&#39; nobody ever tried claiming disco sucked again. It set the template for what Michael Jackson would do a few months later with &#39;Off The Wall.&#39;</p><p>Watching the evening news in 2011 is a strange time-travel experience. &#39;The CBS Evening News,&#39; &#39;ABC World News&#39; and &#39;NBC Nightly News&#39; haven&#39;t changed their style over the decades, still going for that old-fashioned mix of voice-of-authority pomp and feel-good fluff. The difference is that people aren&#39;t watching.</p><p>Acting is a very personal process. It has to do with expressing your own personality, and discovering the character you&#39;re playing through your own experience - so we&#39;re all different.</p><p>Enough of this occupation, terror and abuse. We are not in need of your help. We are able to combat and defeat terrorism, and achieve unity. We are not in need of your bases, your experience and etc.</p><p>I mean, I really liked those guys and the experience of doing Raiders was really good for me, but I did not really want to be involved - I only did Jedi, as I really owed George a favor.</p><p>Rhetoric and dialectics can&#39;t change what I have learned from observation and experience.</p><p>I&#39;m a very professional man. I&#39;m not out for the experience of adventure.</p><p>I think a lot comes from having the experience of doing stand-up comedy. It allows you to figure out the psychology of an audience what things are funny and not.</p><p>Before this learning experience, I had assumed that with regard to programs that sought to help people out of poverty, the political world was essentially divided into two camps: conservatives who opposed these for a variety of reasons, and liberals who supported them.</p><p>While I was pleasantly surprised by the relatively high number of jobs created in April, the fact is that job creation during this recovery period has significantly lagged both historical experience in recovery, and the projections of the Bush Administration.</p><p>Whatever education I got was from experience and reading. But I also realize I wouldn&#39;t pass my friend&#39;s sixth-grade class.</p><p>I just love to experience things. I would do almost anything once.</p><p>I don&#39;t think any good book is based on factual experience. Bad books are about things the writer already knew before he wrote them.</p><p>Literature overtakes history, for literature gives you more than one life. It expands experience and opens new opportunities to readers.</p><p>Experience is the extract of suffering.</p><p>There are people who never experience that, who remain closed until death, from fear of change.</p><p>Capital isn&#39;t that important in business. Experience isn&#39;t that important. You can get both of these things. What is important is ideas.</p><p>Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without.</p><p>It was a very bizarre experience for me, to get the songs together, go in there, and try to deliver them as I would perhaps in a live setting. But I realized that I couldn&#39;t take on that coffeehouse style that I came from and go in there and burn it up.</p><p>Well, for me, what I&#39;ve learned at the very end of this, love is sharing, and I think that really is, for me, the best place to go to experience love, is sharing.</p><p>In some movies you feel like you&#39;re a very small part of a huge machine. Whereas in the theater you can have a very small part, but you can still feel the weight and the gravity of it. Given the nature of theater, it&#39;s a more concentrated and quiet experience.</p><p>Magicians lose the opportunity to experience a sense of wonder.</p><p>I didn&#39;t know if I had the music for it or if I could pull off the larger concert experience. Then I realized if I can just continue to be myself, I&#39;ll be all right.</p><p>I know from my own experience and from other people in the business that when you come from a place where nobody knew who you were and then there is this sudden shift to where everybody now knows who you are, there&#39;s an adjustment that you have to make.</p><p>My films don&#39;t give you an easy ride. I can see that. The sense I get is that people have quite a physical experience with them. They feel afterwards that they&#39;ve really been through something.</p><p>With a lot of films, people are sitting on the outside looking in, but I want the audience to get a bit more intimately involved with what&#39;s going on, so that they maybe can experience it a little bit more intensely.</p><p>If there&#39;s any object in human experience that&#39;s a precedent for what a computer should be like, it&#39;s a musical instrument: a device where you can explore a huge range of possibilities through an interface that connects your mind and your body, allowing you to be emotionally authentic and expressive.</p><p>I&#39;ve had a great experience with pretty much everybody I&#39;ve worked with.</p><p>God&#39;s way of answering the Christian&#39;s prayer for more patience, experience, hope and love often is to put him into the furnace of affliction.</p><p>From this experience we have learned that in a big party it is important to have the necessary and often controversial discussions on policy issues such as the health system while in opposition.</p><p>If you build that foundation, both the moral and the ethical foundation, as well as the business foundation, and the experience foundation, then the building won&#39;t crumble.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m a method actor. I do research when I feel I don&#39;t have enough experience for the part I&#39;m playing.</p><p>My ultimate aim is to make euthanasia a positive experience.</p><p>Theatre, when it is at its best, takes a lot of beating - the live experience and the shared collective experience of live storytelling is really special when it is good. Particularly here in New York because the audiences are amazing, very vocal and very engaged, and that makes theatre very exciting.</p><p>From my experience, politicians are much more uncomfortable being made fun of than they are being preached at and screeched at - you know, and the soapbox routine. They&#39;re much more uneasy knowing they&#39;re a target of ridicule.</p><p>The underlying message of the Lancet article is that if you want to understand aggressive behaviour in children, look to the social and emotional environment in which they are growing up, and the values they bring to the viewing experience.</p><p>The president felt that it was important to send an ordinary citizen to experience the excitement of space travel as a representative for all Americans.</p><p>The mind uses its faculty for creativity only when experience forces it to do so.</p><p>When they call the slightest spending reductions &#39;painful&#39;, we will say &#39;If government spending prevents pain, why are we suffering so much of it?&#39; And &#39;If you want to experience real pain, just stay on the track we are on.&#39;</p><p>You know, I&#39;ve learned a lot from every person I&#39;ve collaborated with, from Madlib to Jean Grae and Hi-Tek, to Mos to DJ Quik, to even somebody like Jermaine Dupri. I&#39;ve taken something important away from every experience.</p><p>Not only did I avoid speaking of Salinger I resisted thinking about him. I did not reread his letters to me. The experience had been too painful.</p><p>If people choose to live their life in a way that does not confront the more troubling aspects of their experience, that&#39;s fine, if it works for them. But it will probably make them uncomfortable if they come up against somebody like me. So they just shouldn&#39;t! They shouldn&#39;t read my work!</p><p>There is no winning or losing, but rather the value is in the experience of imagining yourself as a character in whatever genre you&#39;re involved in, whether it&#39;s a fantasy game, the Wild West, secret agenst or whatever else. You get to sort of vicariously experience those things.</p><p>If you believe your catcher is intelligent and you know that he has considerable experience, it is a good thing to leave the game almost entirely in his hands.</p><p>In my experience an appreciative letter from a fellow writer means a lot.</p><p>A twenty-one-year-old writer is likely to be inhibited by a lack of usable experience. Childhood and adolescence were something I knew.</p><p>I live with one foot in the sand and one in the snow. There&#39;s European egocentricity, and the African opposite. I normally say that my African experience has made me a better European.</p><p>There are a lot of impractical things about owning a Porsche. But they&#39;re all offset by the driving experience. It really is unique. Lamborghinis and Ferraris come close. And they are more powerful, but they don&#39;t handle like a Porsche.</p><p>But I just know from experience that accent wise, even if you&#39;re an accent genius, crossing the Atlantic is the hardest thing in the world either way.</p><p>When he brought it to me four years ago, Rodney King had just arrived, I was involved in the clean-up of L.A. and I guess it was part of my experience.</p><p>I know from my own personal experience. I was bullied in middle school and high school and went through my fair share of hard times thereafter. Also, one of my really good friends committed suicide when I was in high school.</p><p>I don&#39;t think people should have boundaries put on them, by themselves or society or another gender, because it&#39;s our birthright to experience life in whatever way we feel best suits us.</p><p>Work is a substitute religious experience for many workaholics.</p><p>Good judgement comes from experience. Sometimes, experience comes from bad judgement.</p><p>You may count on Mexico&#39;s support, since your commitment to the noblest causes of mankind and your vast experience are and will be invaluable in enabling us, together, to achieve a better world.</p><p>If you&#39;re working on a movie, you want it to be projected on the largest tapestry possible, and the sound to be perfect, and for that kind of communal experience of the movies to take place for it.</p><p>And I like to convey my feelings, my emotions, my experience, the information I have to public use, public opinion.</p><p>Certainly I&#39;ve had the experience of thinking a person was one thing, and finding out they were another.</p><p>And then I went to &#39;Dawson&#39;s Creek,&#39; which is a show that was, for better or for worse, all about the language. It was a word-perfect show, which I&#39;d never had any experience with. And it was really shocking for me. I felt really hemmed in. At the time, it wasn&#39;t my favorite working experience.</p><p>I had the closest thing I have ever had to an out-of-body experience lying in bed one morning. I turned on the &#39;Today&#39; programme and item four on the news was: &#39;The shadow chancellor has ruled himself out of the leadership.&#39; I lay there thinking that&#39;s interesting, then I realised it was me.</p><p>It&#39;s been my experience that every time I think I know where it&#39;s at, it&#39;s usually somewhere else.</p><p>The utmost thing is the user experience, to have the most useful experience.</p><p>Our theory is, if you need the user to tell you what you&#39;re selling, then you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re selling, and it&#39;s probably not going to be a good experience.</p><p>Truth be told, I&#39;m not an easy man. I can be an entertaining one, though it&#39;s been my experience that most people don&#39;t want to be entertained. They want to be comforted.</p><p>The wisdom of the wise, and the experience of ages, may be preserved by quotation.</p><p>We believe that Lebanon has been the first real experience for all the Arabs.</p><p>Today, the Iraqi citizen sees that America is coming and wants to occupy his country and kill him, and he is willing to experience for himself what happened in Palestine.</p><p>Putting is like wisdom - partly a natural gift and partly the accumulation of experience.</p><p>I have been blessed in many ways, and one of those is to have been born in Africa, for me a great treasure house of stories. I have been researching it since my infancy reading about it, talking to men and women who have spent their lives in this land, living it as I have and loving it as I do. I write almost entirely from my own experience.</p><p>I was thinking that we all learn by experience, but some of us have to go to summer school.</p><p>Past experience with fiscal austerity at home and overseas strongly suggests that it is best for the economy&#39;s long-run performance to restrain government spending rather than raise taxes.</p><p>It&#39;s really fun at night, because I can see the baby kicking. I can feel the knee or the foot. The baby is starting to get heavy, and it&#39;s a really incredible feeling. I&#39;m so grateful I get to experience this.</p><p>When you go visiting countries, you start reading the history of the place and you start getting into the culture, and then you have to leave. In my experience, all countries have hidden treasures.</p><p>I&#39;ve always loved the experience of working together with other people toward an artistic goal.</p><p>There are a lot of things that make up a performance, a lot of technical things. It isn&#39;t always just about pulling it up from the darkest recesses of your mind or your heart. It&#39;s your experience and your observation.</p><p>Once you&#39;re in a particular country, and you&#39;re surrounded by musicians who are so adept at traditional music, you suddenly realize how much there is to explore and digest and learn and experience.</p><p>Marimba is much more of a wood-type experience and there is no real possibility of getting a dry sound, and getting that contrast in the same way that you can in a vibraphone.</p><p>Now, having had this experience, I can&#39;t say really what they were looking for. I don&#39;t know their minds. But every time I see a reality show, it seems that the most entertaining parts on other reality shows are when they make their guests look foolish.</p><p>Women have no sympathy and my experience of women is almost as large as Europe.</p><p>An identity would seem to be arrived at by the way in which the person faces and uses his experience.</p><p>When something is new to us, we treat it as an experience. We feel that our senses are awake and clear. We are alive.</p><p>You know, my life&#39;s changed now. I&#39;m starting to experience what people are really supposed to do. You supposed to be married. You&#39;re supposed to have a family, kids, treat your wife right.</p><p>The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.</p><p>There are some things you only learn through experience.</p><p>On the one hand, we&#39;ll never experience childbirth. On the other hand, we can open all our own jars.</p><p>If you started in New York you were dealing with the biggest guys in the world. You&#39;re dealing with Charlie Parker and all the big bands and everything. We got more experience working in Seattle.</p><p>I feel like if I won an award and I was giving my speech and the music started, that&#39;s all I&#39;d remember, the humiliation I felt when the music started. It would mar the entire experience for me.</p><p>I had decided I wanted to write about food, and I knew the only way to do that is to speak with authority, which meant learning the language and knowing what that experience is like.</p><p>The plain man is familiar with blindness and deafness, and knows from his everyday experience that the look of things is influenced by his senses but it never occurs to him to regard the whole world as the creation of his senses.</p><p>The experience is fundamentally different for buying from local businesses than it is for buying consumer goods.</p><p>You&#39;re creating an intimacy that everybody feels, that it&#39;s their experience, not yours. I&#39;ll never introduce a song and say, now this song is about &#39;my&#39; broken heart.</p><p>You ask any moviemaker what their favorite movie experience was, and they&#39;ll say it was one of the first ones, where everyone had to pitch in and do everything together, and you had to struggle.</p><p>Being in love is the only transcendent experience.</p><p>I&#39;ve had a lot of experience in independent film, and about how to choose. You&#39;ve got to be very discerning about where you put your five bucks, and where you cut and what you don&#39;t cut.</p><p>Dramatic experience is not logical it may be subdued to the kind of coherence that we indicate when we speak, in criticism, of form.</p><p>So if I have two pieces of cake, do I have twice as good an experience as the first piece of cake? One of the things I&#39;ve found in life is that the first piece of cake is the best.</p><p>Your own experience keeps taking you towards something. My book adds the hope that it&#39;s a better something.</p><p>My advice would be to write what is most personal and specific to your experience or your life. And your voice will emerge and because of its specificity, it will be universal.</p><p>Succeeding is not really a life experience that does that much good. Failing is a much more sobering and enlightening experience.</p><p>Also, I knew that the impact of Motorcycle Diaries was going to be so resonant for all of us who went through the experience of making it that I didn&#39;t want to do anything that could reflect it.</p><p>The course of the flight up and down was exceedingly erratic, partly due to the irregularity of the air, and partly to lack of experience in handling this machine. The control of the front rudder was difficult on account of its being balanced too near the center.</p><p>I loved making Pure Country. It was a great learning experience for me, seeing another part of the entertainment industry.</p><p>I&#39;ve never had issues with popularity. I was always a popular guy... I&#39;ve always had friends and loved ones and everything, so it wasn&#39;t like, &#39;Oh man, I gotta fill some void that was left by high school.&#39; I had a great high-school experience.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe in the so-called Olympic spirit. I speak from personal experience. When China hosted the Games, it failed to include the people. The event was constructed without regard for their joy.</p><p>We are creating a unique experience. It&#39;s starts with how you see the building from a distance.</p><p>When you grow up in a family of languages, you develop a kind of casual fluency, so that languages, though differently colored, all seem transparent to experience.</p><p>My feeling about work is it&#39;s much more about the experience of doing it than the end product. Sometimes things that are really great and make lots of money are miserable to make, and vice versa.</p><p>Music and language are a vital element. We, as actors and directors, offer it to people who want to experience it. Sometimes the actual meaning is less important than the words themselves.</p><p>It is brilliant going to the theatre and being forced to sit and listen and think about life. It can be almost a near-religious experience.</p><p>And actually, about three weeks ago, Micky, Peter and I were in Vegas at the MGM Grand. And we did about 12 shows in seven days. It was quite an experience.</p><p>You want to do something that shows some type individuality and talent and imagination - at the same time, you want to be truthful to the predecessors, because obviously the audience liked something about them and you have to replicate that experience to a certain extent.</p><p>A man of conviction is often more to be desired than a man of experience.</p><p>You&#39;re working on being a father, so that is something that when you experience it you&#39;ll understand the profundity of wanting to protect something dear to you.</p><p>No student of Chinese history can say that the Chinese are incapable of religious experience, even when judged by the standards of medieval Europe or pious India.</p><p>The resistance of a woman is not always a proof of her virtue, but more frequently of her experience.</p><p>And so I think that if the person has the funds, the network, and the equipment to do this, and also the experience, which is the key factor, then they can be quite deadly.</p><p>We really haven&#39;t had very much experience with people funding their retirement out of the stock market, and we don&#39;t know, frankly, how it would work under every scenario.</p><p>For me, it is just the total experience - from the time I first started as an assistant coach until I wound up at the University of Texas for 20 years.</p><p>Louis Malle was the best filmmaker I&#39;ve ever worked with. He was such an artist. He was dealing with the theme of innocence and experience.</p><p>But because we&#39;ve all been readers, we know what the experience is like, and we hope that what certain writers have given to us, we will give to someone.</p><p>I will perform My Heart Will Go On for the rest of my life and it will always remain a very emotional experience for me.</p><p>I love music, and after my first experience with movies, I can&#39;t wait to do more.</p><p>Judgment comes from experience and great judgment comes from bad experience.</p><p>The most important training, though, is to experience life as a writer, questioning everything, inventing multiple explanations for everything. If you do that, all the other things will come if you don&#39;t, there&#39;s no hope for you.</p><p>Well, you know, the definition of second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience.</p><p>I am very happy since when I am in different cities I can experience and learn different cultures!</p><p>I&#39;m always hoping for the nights that are inspired where you almost have an out of body experience.</p><p>At our best, it&#39;s a good experience but we do 22 episodes a year, so there are some clunkers.</p><p>I got pregnant at 40 by surprise. It&#39;s funny, because when we found out we were pregnant, I said, &#39;Okay, let&#39;s experience that.&#39; You just have to just go with it because it&#39;s rare.</p><p>Many children are natural fantasists, I think, perhaps because their imaginations have yet to be clobbered into submission by experience.</p><p>Acting is not a mystery. There&#39;s nothing that I know that other actors don&#39;t know. We all act, we&#39;re all actors, we all know the same thing. The only thing that separates us is experience.</p><p>I feel responsible that everyone has a really wonderful experience and to do the best work possible, and to always know my lines and to always be on time and to bring a level to the show in terms of quality that other people will follow.</p><p>It evolved from my experience in the fifties, growing up during the McCarthy era, and hearing a lot of assumptions that America was wonderful and Communism was terrible.</p><p>Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.</p><p>I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can&#39;t accept not trying.</p><p>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not the world is full of educated failures. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.</p><p>My great concern is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with your failure.</p><p>Remembering that I&#39;ll be dead soon is the most important tool I&#39;ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.</p><p>I&#39;ve come to believe that all my past failure and frustration were actually laying the foundation for the understandings that have created the new level of living I now enjoy.</p><p>Do not fear mistakes. You will know failure. Continue to reach out.</p><p>Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement.</p><p>Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed on an equal or greater benefit.</p><p>Before success comes in any man&#39;s life, he&#39;s sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. That&#39;s exactly what the majority of men do.</p><p>It&#39;s fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.</p><p>Ambition is the last refuge of the failure.</p><p>Don&#39;t be afraid to fail. Don&#39;t waste energy trying to cover up failure. Learn from your failures and go on to the next challenge. It&#39;s OK to fail. If you&#39;re not failing, you&#39;re not growing.</p><p>We have forty million reasons for failure, but not a single excuse.</p><p>One of the common failings among honorable people is a failure to appreciate how thoroughly dishonorable some other people can be, and how dangerous it is to trust them.</p><p>If you learn from defeat, you haven&#39;t really lost.</p><p>A man can fail many times, but he isn&#39;t a failure until he begins to blame somebody else.</p><p>Any fact facing us is not as important as our attitude toward it, for that determines our success or failure. The way you think about a fact may defeat you before you ever do anything about it. You are overcome by the fact because you think you are.</p><p>Many of life&#39;s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.</p><p>You are capable of more than you know. Choose a goal that seems right for you and strive to be the best, however hard the path. Aim high. Behave honorably. Prepare to be alone at times, and to endure failure. Persist! The world needs all you can give.</p><p>Do not brood over your past mistakes and failures as this will only fill your mind with grief, regret and depression. Do not repeat them in the future.</p><p>Remember that failure is an event, not a person.</p><p>You cannot climb the ladder of success dressed in the costume of failure.</p><p>Failure is not fatal, but failure to change might be.</p><p>Failure is not a single, cataclysmic event. You don&#39;t fail overnight. Instead, failure is a few errors in judgement, repeated every day.</p><p>When I was young, I observed that nine out of ten things I did were failures. So I did ten times more work.</p><p>Success is the result of perfection, hard work, learning from failure, loyalty, and persistence.</p><p>Failure is a detour, not a dead-end street.</p><p>There is no failure except in no longer trying.</p><p>Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe in failure. It is not failure if you enjoyed the process.</p><p>There is no such thing as failure. There are only results.</p><p>If you&#39;re doing your best, you won&#39;t have any time to worry about failure.</p><p>Success is often achieved by those who don&#39;t know that failure is inevitable.</p><p>A failure is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying.</p><p>If you&#39;re not failing every now and again, it&#39;s a sign you&#39;re not doing anything very innovative.</p><p>Restlessness is discontent and discontent is the first necessity of progress. Show me a thoroughly satisfied man and I will show you a failure.</p><p>Winning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do something in life, the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes undefeated all the time. If you can pick up after a crushing defeat, and go on to win again, you are going to be a champion someday.</p><p>One&#39;s only rival is one&#39;s own potentialities. One&#39;s only failure is failing to live up to one&#39;s own possibilities. In this sense, every man can be a king, and must therefore be treated like a king.</p><p>It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might has well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default.</p><p>Achievement is not always success, while reputed failure often is. It is honest endeavor, persistent effort to do the best possible under any and all circumstances.</p><p>Show me a thoroughly satisfied man and I will show you a failure.</p><p>I really don&#39;t think life is about the I-could-have-beens. Life is only about the I-tried-to-do. I don&#39;t mind the failure but I can&#39;t imagine that I&#39;d forgive myself if I didn&#39;t try.</p><p>I think you can have 10,000 explanations for failure, but no good explanation for success.</p><p>It is not because the truth is too difficult to see that we make mistakes... we make mistakes because the easiest and most comfortable course for us is to seek insight where it accords with our emotions - especially selfish ones.</p><p>To establish true self-esteem we must concentrate on our successes and forget about the failures and the negatives in our lives.</p><p>Failure after long perseverance is much grander than never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.</p><p>Through perseverance many people win success out of what seemed destined to be certain failure.</p><p>Go on failing. Go on. Only next time, try to fail better.</p><p>Failure is a word unknown to me.</p><p>All that is necessary to break the spell of inertia and frustration is this: Act as if it were impossible to fail. That is the talisman, the formula, the command of right about face which turns us from failure to success.</p><p>Don&#39;t be afraid of missing opportunities. Behind every failure is an opportunity somebody wishes they had missed.</p><p>Every failure is a step to success.</p><p>You will be a failure, until you impress the subconscious with the conviction you are a success. This is done by making an affirmation which &#39;clicks.&#39;</p><p>It&#39;s best to have failure happen early in life. It wakes up the Phoenix bird in you so you rise from the ashes.</p><p>The only failure one should fear, is not hugging to the purpose they see as best.</p><p>There is only one failure in life possible, and that is not to be true to the best one knows.</p><p>We failed, but in the good providence of God apparent failure often proves a blessing.</p><p>Success is not built on success. It&#39;s built on failure. It&#39;s built on frustration. Sometimes its built on catastrophe.</p><p>For every failure, there&#39;s an alternative course of action. You just have to find it. When you come to a roadblock, take a detour.</p><p>Success comes when people act together failure tends to happen alone.</p><p>They who have conquered doubt and fear have conquered failure.</p><p>Do not be embarrassed by your failures, learn from them and start again.</p><p>The season of failure is the best time for sowing the seeds of success.</p><p>The young think that failure is the Siberian end of the line, banishment from all the living, and tend to do what I then did - which was to hide.</p><p>There are some defeats more triumphant than victories.</p><p>It is wise to keep in mind that neither success nor failure is ever final.</p><p>All human actions are equivalent... and all are on principle doomed to failure.</p><p>Failure happens all the time. It happens every day in practice. What makes you better is how you react to it.</p><p>Indecision and delays are the parents of failure.</p><p>A person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself. He makes his failure certain by himself being the first person to be convinced of it.</p><p>Do not blame anybody for your mistakes and failures.</p><p>If at first you don&#39;t succeed, failure may be your style.</p><p>Success and failure are equally disastrous.</p><p>Success isn&#39;t permanent and failure isn&#39;t fatal.</p><p>It is not a disgrace to fail. Failing is one of the greatest arts in the world.</p><p>Show me a good and gracious loser and I&#39;ll show you a failure.</p><p>The great question is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with failure.</p><p>You gotta lose &#39;em some of the time. When you do, lose &#39;em right.</p><p>The only risk of failure is promotion.</p><p>We climb to heaven most often on the ruins of our cherished plans, finding our failures were successes.</p><p>Do not let your ambitions become a sanctuary for your failures.</p><p>A life which does not go into action is a failure.</p><p>I hate to be a failure. I hate and regret the failure of my marriages. I would gladly give all my millions for just one lasting marital success.</p><p>There could be no honor in a sure success, but much might be wrested from a sure defeat.</p><p>Success represents the 1% of your work which results from the 99% that is called failure.</p><p>A hatred of failure has always been part of my nature.</p><p>Success is never final, but failure can be.</p><p>Failure is always an option.</p><p>Often the difference between a successful person and a failure is not one has better abilities or ideas, but the courage that one has to bet on one&#39;s ideas, to take a calculated risk - and to act.</p><p>Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive.</p><p>Failure to prepare is preparing to fail.</p><p>Our failings sometimes bind us to one another as closely as could virtue itself.</p><p>It would be great to be able to pass on to someone all of the successes, the failures, and the knowledge that one has had. To help someone, avoid all the fire, pain and anxiety would be wonderful.</p><p>Don&#39;t be afraid of failure be afraid of petty success.</p><p>My life has been nothing but a failure.</p><p>You always pass failure on your way to success.</p><p>Never walk away from failure. On the contrary, study it carefully and imaginatively for its hidden assets.</p><p>I never see failure as failure, but only as the game I must play and win.</p><p>We may be personally defeated, but our principles never!</p><p>The world is divided into two categories: failures and unknowns.</p><p>I have probably purchased fifty &#39;hot tips&#39; in my career, maybe even more. When I put them all together, I know I am a net loser.</p><p>Notice the difference between what happens when a man says to himself, I have failed three times, and what happens when he says, I am a failure.</p><p>Failure is a word that I simply don&#39;t accept.</p><p>The most important of my discoveries have been suggested to me by my failures.</p><p>Remember the two benefits of failure. First, if you do fail, you learn what doesn&#39;t work and second, the failure gives you the opportunity to try a new approach.</p><p>At least I have the modesty to admit that lack of modesty is one of my failings.</p><p>Before you can win a game, you have to not lose it.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t afraid to fail. Something good always comes out of failure.</p><p>Losing is no disgrace if you&#39;ve given your best.</p><p>Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.</p><p>In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.</p><p>Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.</p><p>Think twice before you speak, because your words and influence will plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of another.</p><p>Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.</p><p>I don&#39;t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.</p><p>You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don&#39;t try to forget the mistakes, but you don&#39;t dwell on it. You don&#39;t let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.</p><p>Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success.</p><p>Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.</p><p>The only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows.</p><p>Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.</p><p>There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.</p><p>I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.</p><p>Failure is success if we learn from it.</p><p>Defeat is not the worst of failures. Not to have tried is the true failure.</p><p>Success or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something. Soon it becomes a reality. Act, look, feel successful, conduct yourself accordingly, and you will be amazed at the positive results.</p><p>It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.</p><p>A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success.</p><p>Success depends upon previous preparation, and without such preparation there is sure to be failure.</p><p>The fact that we are here today to debate raising America&#39;s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I, therefore, intend to oppose the effort to increase America&#39;s debt.</p><p>Like success, failure is many things to many people. With Positive Mental Attitude, failure is a learning experience, a rung on the ladder, a plateau at which to get your thoughts in order and prepare to try again.</p><p>A man who has never made a woman angry is a failure in life.</p><p>As kids we&#39;re not taught how to deal with success we&#39;re taught how to deal with failure. If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try, try again. If at first you succeed, then what?</p><p>Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.</p><p>People in their handlings of affairs often fail when they are about to succeed. If one remains as careful at the end as he was at the beginning, there will be no failure.</p><p>Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness.</p><p>Socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it.</p><p>Once you start a working on something, don&#39;t be afraid of failure and don&#39;t abandon it. People who work sincerely are the happiest.</p><p>Never fret for an only son, the idea of failure will never occur to him.</p><p>Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure.</p><p>Failure is the key to success each mistake teaches us something.</p><p>Failure is unimportant. It takes courage to make a fool of yourself.</p><p>My reputation grows with every failure.</p><p>Success is never final, failure is never fatal. It&#39;s courage that counts.</p><p>A failure is a man who has blundered, but is not able to cash in the experience.</p><p>Optimism is a kind of heart stimulant - the digitalis of failure.</p><p>Failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day.</p><p>The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it: so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it.</p><p>The majority of men meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.</p><p>In America, there&#39;s a failure to appreciate Europe&#39;s leading role in the world.</p><p>No man ever achieved worth-while success who did not, at one time or other, find himself with at least one foot hanging well over the brink of failure.</p><p>Tragedy in life normally comes with betrayal and compromise, and trading on your integrity and not having dignity in life. That&#39;s really where failure comes.</p><p>Failure doesn&#39;t mean you are a failure it just means you haven&#39;t succeeded yet.</p><p>The Bush Administration&#39;s failure to be consistently involved in helping Israel achieve peace with the Palestinians has been both wrong for our friendship with Israel, as well as badly damaging to our standing in the Arab world.</p><p>Why should anybody be interested in some old man who was a failure?</p><p>So while I will never minimize the costs involved in military action, I am convinced that a failure to act in Libya would have carried a far greater price for America.</p><p>The theory seems to be that as long as a man is a failure he is one of God&#39;s children, but that as soon as he succeeds he is taken over by the Devil.</p><p>Failure comes only when we forget our ideals and objectives and principles.</p><p>There&#39;s always failure. And there&#39;s always disappointment. And there&#39;s always loss. But the secret is learning from the loss, and realizing that none of those holes are vacuums.</p><p>You must accept that you might fail then, if you do your best and still don&#39;t win, at least you can be satisfied that you&#39;ve tried. If you don&#39;t accept failure as a possibility, you don&#39;t set high goals, you don&#39;t branch out, you don&#39;t try - you don&#39;t take the risk.</p><p>The guns and the bombs, the rockets and the warships, are all symbols of human failure.</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/quotes/edit/main/src/guide/Dreams do come.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/Dewey.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Dewey</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/Drucker.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Drucker</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
